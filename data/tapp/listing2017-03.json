I'm going to try to keep this relatively short. We got a few things going on today, and I know that the pool has got to get out to do a spray at some point soon with the lunch.\nSo, obviously, last night was a big night for the President and for everyone here at the White House. The President delivered a powerful statement to Congress, to Americans, and the world last night. It was an optimistic, forward-looking message of unity, strength, straight from his heart. The President was proud to stand before the American people last night and present his roadmap for a renewal of the American spirit. He honestly and -- he honestly acknowledged the undeniable challenges that we face, but continually reminded us there's no challenge facing this country that we can't meet if we join together.\nThe American spirit has already proven itself against seemingly insurmountable odds, and we'll do it again under the leadership of this President.\nRepublicans and Democrats may be divided on policies, but we're also united in our mission to achieve peace and prosperity for every American citizen. The President has obviously been humbled by the great reception that the -- the reception that his address received. Today, the President is holding a series of meetings with White House staff, congressional leaders, and others to drive the goals that he laid out last night.\nHe'll host shortly a leadership lunch with House and Senate Republican leadership. The attendees will include the Vice President, Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Senator Cornyn, Leader McCarthy, Congressman Scalise, Senator Gardiner and Senator Perdue.\nLast night's address clearly generated a lot of momentum, and the President is anxious to continue working on an ambitious legislative agenda. During his speech last night, the President mentioned policies in key areas, from urban renewal to trade reform, where too many leading agencies and departments in charge of implementing are still waiting on their confirmed leaders.\nThe President was pleased, obviously, to see that Ryan Zinke was confirmed as the Secretary of the Interior by the Senate just a short time ago. So the confirmation process is now coming to an end for him, and start to get the work going.\nAs the President mentioned in last night's remarks -- and, by the way, one quick note, we'll have an update on his swearing-in hopefully soon. As the President mentioned in last night's remarks, he's calling on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a patient-focused system that expands options, lowers costs, and improves healthcare outcomes for all Americans. He's ready to restart the honest engine -- to restart the engine of the American economy, which means tax reform that brings down rates for the middle class and simplifies the tax code, a robust infrastructure program and a budget that puts the interests of American people first.\nThe President and congressional leaders will work together today to continue to chart a path forward on those issues and more. Also, today, Judge Neil Gorsuch will be back up on the Hill meeting with seven senators, including Senators Booker, Sanders, Barrasso and Kaine. And lastly, this evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary Tillerson.\nLooking ahead, I know Sarah was kind enough to come brief you yesterday about the President's trip to Hampton Roads tomorrow. I'll have a few more details for you on that. The President is looking forward to meeting with the members of the Navy and some of the sailors down there, the shipbuilders, including the lead shipbuilder of the USS Gerald Ford and the ship's commander, before giving remarks on deck to a group of shipbuilders and sailors.\nOn Friday, the President will be in Orlando, Florida for a series of important events highlighting his educational agenda. He'll be visiting St. Andrews Catholic School, where I think you can expect him to drop in on a few lucky classrooms, as well as meeting with parents, teachers, and administrators. Education, as was noted last night from the President, is a top priority. He has said many times before that education has the ability to level the playing field for the next generation. Obviously, last night he noted that he believes this is the civil rights issue of this generation. He is determined to provide choice for every parent, and opportunities for every child, regardless of their zip code. I expect he will be speaking with the parents and teachers and administrators at St. Andrews on his upcoming plans for reaching that goal.\nAnd finally, I want to note that the President is monitoring the situation in the Midwest, where a string of tornadoes is devastating several states with more severe weather predicted for the coming states -- for the coming days. Three lives have already been tragically cut short. The families of those victims and also those who have had their homes and property destroyed are in the President's thoughts and prayers. The millions of people in the path of severe weather will be at the top of his mind over the next few days. He implores everyone to follow the directions of emergency services and stay inside, and obviously will continue to be in contact with state and local officials to provide the necessary federal support that is required.\nWith that, I'm glad to take some questions.\nQ: On the lunch today, was it always --\nMR. SPICER: John Roberts. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- was it always just going to be Republican leadership? Were the Democrats ever invited? Will he meet with the Democrats?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I'm sure he will. And you've seen he's met with a bipartisan group of Senate leaders last week. He met with a bipartisan group of attorney general yesterday. He met with the bipartisan group of governors. I mean, just to be factual here, at some point, the people who set the agenda and the timetable to enact his agenda are Republican, and so there's a difference between meeting with both sides of the aisle, and I think he has pretty well shown a desire to reach across the aisle in the last month. But this is about actually charting out the agenda and the timeline, and that's why it's both groups. But yeah, I think you'll continue to see not just -- in the next week, not just leadership but rank-and-file members of the House and the Senate with that aim.\nQ: Sean, the Dow Jones crossed 21,000 for the first time today.\nMR. SPICER: It did.\nQ: Does the White House believe that that's a reaction to the President's speech last night?\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Look, I'm not an economist. I don't want to -- I know the Dow goes up and down, as well as the other indexes, and I don't want to get in the habit of commenting every time the Dow hits. But I think that you've seen a sustained economic boon since the President was elected. He commented on it last night.\nI think you're seeing not just the Dow react, but manufacturers, business leaders, folks from small and large companies talk about it. And I think that there is a renewed sense of wanting to business, and of economic growth and optimism. You've seen it in not just in the indexes on a day-to-day basis as they go up and down, but also in the confidence numbers that show that there is a continued growth in the confidence in our economy and our market and our policies.\nLook, I don't want to tie a direct link. I think that that's -- you know, we could go back and forth every day about where the market stands at any given time in a day. But I would have to believe that when you talk to a lot of economists, they -- and frankly, not just the economists who look at it academically and try to parse it, but when you talk to these company CEOs and leaders that he's talking to, there is a renewed sense of confidence in their country, in the agenda, in the desire to hire and grow and expand in the United States, and I can only see that as a positive sign, not just for the market, but for our entire economy.\nQ: How long -- to follow up on that -- how long does the President think he can wait in order to provide specifics on tax reform and Obamacare and the others before we start to lose that sense of momentum and confidence that you're talking about in the markets?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think it's not just those pieces. Obviously, it's bigger than just that. But I think that, with respect to Obamacare, he's talked about the next few weeks having something out there, and then same with tax reform. And I think both of those things that we'll be working with the Hill. Secretary Mnuchin mentioned the other day that hopefully having a tax plan done by (inaudible).\nBut both of those, specifically, are massive undertakings. And the idea that they are going to be done in two seconds is a little bit of a fallacy, and I think that we've given folks updates and guidelines as far as when we see this thing moving. And I think that that's a pretty good guide of where we go.\nJim Stinson.\nQ: Sean, Governor Beshear said on Morning Joe today -- I'm paraphrasing -- that people are going to die if GOP healthcare plans more forward. What does the administration say to Democrats suggesting Obamacare repeal will cost American lives?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I would suggest to the former governor that, when you look at where Obamacare stands right now -- I think I've mentioned this before, Jim -- but more and more people are facing higher and higher premiums. People are choosing to opt out of the exchange and pay the penalty. It is collapsing on its own.\nAnd I don't -- I think that that's a bit extreme. The reality is that more people are having problems right now. They're losing their doctor. They're losing the plan that they liked. I'd like him to defend -- I mean, I read to you guys two days ago Nancy Pelosi's own definition of success for Obamacare. They had three prongs for that, and they failed on all three of them.\nSo Governor Beshear -- you know, the President last night extended an olive branch to Democrats and Republicans to work with him on a plan that actually achieves the goals that were laid out. That's what he should -- if he wants to be focused, it's not just former governors, but I think current governors were here to talk about what they want. And so I know Governor Bevin, the current governor of Kentucky, has noted the concerns that Obamacare has in Kentucky now. And I think those are the challenges and problems that the President is seeking to fix on this.\nThe reality is, is that we have to have a healthcare system that Americans can afford, that give them choice, that have doctors that can deal with the problems they have. And that's what we're working with Congress on right now is to get that kind of a plan in place.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. One brief question.\nMR. SPICER: Wow. (Laughter.)\nQ: Senator Schumer, the Minority Leader, has said that the President is stalling on one of the pivotal points of his agenda -- infrastructure -- where he could work with Democrats. What's the administration's response to Senator Schumer?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think first and foremost, I'm glad to see that he has finally found one area that he's willing to work with the President on. I know that multiple times this morning he was offered an opportunity on various shows to talk about things that he thought they could work with on the -- with the President. And I think it took -- in particular, I saw the exchange on NBC and it was somewhat disappointing that when you look at all the things that the President said that I think offered an olive branch to both parties and seemingly should unify the country on issues and on goals, that it's nice to finally hear that we found one. Because I think there were a lot of areas in that speech last night that transcended party lines and ideology, and that united us all as Americans.\nWith respect to infrastructure, I think the President noted last night that we're going to continue to see a plan evolve that's really structured in a private partner financing mechanism that will continue to move forward. But whether it's our roads or bridges, our airports, air traffic control, there is an infrastructure piece of our nation that is so vital to the way we do life. And not just that, but -- not just the building itself and the construction of it, but those roads are what -- are the byway and the pathway to so much of our economic commerce today. And doing them not only is good for the jobs that they will create on the projects, but allowing us to have -- allowing products to get to market and consumers to get to business, et cetera, is actually a magnifying event for that.\nQ: Sean, I'm just looking for some clarification on your comments from the last week about the administration's stance on recreational marijuana. During the campaign, the President had said that this is a states' rights issue. Is this still where he believes this issue should flow, or does he believe it's a federal --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I think, Trey, there is a specific carve-out in the appropriations for medical marijuana. And I think the President understands that that can be a vital part of treatment, especially for terminally ill patients and people facing certain kinds of medical things. But there is a -- I think I was very -- I'm sorry if I wasn't, but I think I was clear that there is a big difference between the medical and the non-medical.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, two things on the speech. The President talked about robust engagement when he was talking about foreign policy. But at the same time, the White House is talking about cutting foreign aid by a large amount. How do you track those two things?\nMR. SPICER: Well, because you can have engagement -- I mean, I don't know that --\nQ: Like, who is going to be doing the diplomacy if you're cutting the State Department funding?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, who is going to be doing it? There's people that do --\nQ: Who is the lead on foreign policy? Is it the White House or the State Department?\nMR. SPICER: Secretary of State.\nQ: It is the Secretary of State?\nMR. SPICER: Of course, it is. I mean, look, the President obviously guides our foreign policy in terms of who implements it, whether it's -- if you talk about healthcare, it's going to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If it's on trade, it's going to be the USTR. I mean, so it's pretty clear that the Secretary of State implements the President's foreign policy agenda.\nQ: Right, but more robust versus cutting. They sound contradictory --\nMR. SPICER: But, again, I think this is a very Washington trap. Just because dollars do not decide engagement -- I think one of the things that's fascinating is that as the President has talked to all of these foreign leaders -- I don't know in a single case -- and, again, I can't say I've been on every call -- but I can't think of -- maybe one or two or something, because again, I don't want to get in a trap of trying to -- but I cannot say in most cases, at least, that I've heard direct aid being a discussion that has come up.\nIn fact, what I hear more often is: \"Gosh, we haven't heard from the United States in a long time. We haven't had you engage in issues of concern with us. We haven't talked about trade. We haven't talked about other issues of bilateral concern.\" I think that's what a robust, healthy, bilateral relationship with a country is about.\nI think it is a very Washington-centered argument to literally tie dollars to any program or any type of engagement -- to say something is robust by the dollar figure is something that is a very Washington answer. But I think that you can look at dollars that have gotten to a lot of countries. And when we ask them, what's your relationship been with the United States? They'll say, we haven't had much engagement at all with the United States in a while.\nAnita.\nQ: Sorry, I had a second question --\nMR. SPICER: John tried to start something; it just didn't continue. (Laughter.)\nQ: In the speech last night, while the President talked about support for vets and support for military, he didn't talk about the 9,000 troops in Afghanistan, the 5,000 in Iraq, the hundreds of operators on the ground in Syria. Was there a reason that he didn't lay out his vision for foreign policy in those active war zones?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think you could probably go through and say, he also didn't talk about this or that. He talked about his --\nQ: The world is watching, and those are clear --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But you can go through a lot of hotspots that we have in a country. I think when it comes to the military itself, he was very clear about his commitment to the military, his desire to fund the military, give them the infrastructure that it needs. It's why he's going to go to Hampton Roads tomorrow to talk about the investment that needs to get made. He talked about veterans and caring for the folks.\nSo I understand your question. But I think at some point you can literally go through all of the other areas that may not have come up on domestic and foreign policy, other nations that didn't get a mention, or a hotspot that didn't get up.\nBut I think in terms of his commitment to the country, his commitment to defeating ISIS, he did bring that up. He talked about the plan that he wants to have, the engagement that he's having with the Joint Chiefs in the military, the funding that he wants to lend them.\nSo I get that you can parse out something and say, \"but he didn't bring up this exact thing.\" There's a lot of things that may or may not have come up last night, and that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't have the commitment to it.\nQ: He wasn't deemphasizing foreign policy?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think he talked about ISIS. He talked about the military. He talked about it. So I don't have --\nAnita.\nQ: It will not surprise you that I have two questions. The first one is quick.\nMR. SPICER: I think for Lent everyone needs to give up two questions. (Laughter.) Or maybe I could at least give up answering two questions. (Laughter.)\nQ: I'll make the first one quick, so how about that? Can you update us on where we are on the executive order regarding vetting?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, as I said, we would have an announcement at some point scheduling-wise. When we have one, we'll announce it. I think the President, as I mentioned a couple days ago, the issue for us has been a continued desire to share with the departments and agencies the ability to implement this, and we continue to do that. When we have a schedule to announce --\nQ: When do you think --\nMR. SPICER: I've not -- I've learned not to put days on things, because until we announce it, it's much like we've talked about all the executive orders, with all the personnel announcements. When the President is ready to make a decision, he lets us know and we let you know. So we're not there yet.\nQ: The second question -- can you tell us a little bit about the back story with Carryn Owens being there yesterday? She wasn't on the list you all sent out. When did the President talk to her? When did that happen? When was she invited? Why wasn't she on the official list? And did they have a chance to visit beforehand?\nMR. SPICER: Okay, I'll take these in order. She was invited on January 30th. In the condolence call to her, the President invited her and her three children to the White House. And during that call, said, \"You know, by the way, I'm going to be giving this speech in February. If you would feel comfortable, I would love to have you as a guest.\" He asked if she'd like to bring the kids at that time. It was obviously a very raw and emotional time for her, and she said that's -- she appreciated the invitation, she would love to take him up on it, would get back to us. The President asked the military aide in the room at the time to follow up with her. She accepted the invitation. So she and her three children came to the White House yesterday, met with the President prior to the speech, and they had a time to visit before and then after, obviously.\nWhy she wasn't on the guidance: We had a conversation with her prior, and just said, you know, I know this is an emotional time for you. Respectfully to you guys, we knew that if we had released her name, that there would be a lot of media attention to her and her family. And we spoke to her before we put out the guest guidance and just said, would you rather us wait and hold? So we made a decision at the time that this was a very raw and emotional time for her, and we didn't -- we worked with her to decide what would be in her best interest and her family's best interest at this time.\nQ: Were the children there?\nMR. SPICER: No, they were not there.\nQ: But her parents were there, correct?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: But the children were in town --\nMR. SPICER: The children were in town. They visited the White House. They had an opportunity to visit the Navy Mess, have lunch, go up and see -- and so the President got to see them. And they got a tour of the White House.\nQ: Was there some special interaction with Ivanka, because she was sitting next to her? Or it just happened to be where she sat?\nMR. SPICER: They met obviously over -- and obviously after -- at the end of the evening, the President brought them into the room where he was holding, and everybody, including the First Lady, had a chance to talk to her and her family, and mother and father. But, as I said, this was something that was extended -- the invitation was extended to her on the 30th of January when the President made that first call to her.\nAnd again, just respectfully in terms of the follow-up, I know there's been a lot of interest in her, in Carryn. And we have -- our goal was to make sure that we respected her wishes and her privacy. And again, even with referencing her in the speech, that was her decision. We asked her -- the President would like to raise this. And she said, I'd like that. And so that was coordinated with her in terms of how public she wanted to be and how acknowledged she wanted her and Ryan to be as well.\nQ: I just thought I'd bring this up so you could respond to it. You must have seen the criticism of her being there and the President mentioning her. And people are saying it's a photo-op. So since you're talking about it, do you want to respond to that, that it's a way to --\nMR. SPICER: I think that that's -- I mean, again, he invited her on January 30th and extended an invitation. I don't -- it was she who accepted the invitation. I think she has a right to honor the legacy and sacrifice of her husband. And I think -- I've been in this town 25 years, probably watched State of the Unions for 30 -- which doesn't say a lot -- (laughter) -- for my viewing habits -- but I've never seen a sustained applause like that. And I think that you can say what you want about a lot of the policies, but I hope to God that everybody in America could literally say that that's the country that we live in, that you honor and support, not just Ryan's sacrifice, but her -- what she's going to go through and what those children are going to go through.\nIt was amazing -- I got a chance to talk to the kids yesterday and see them so -- you know, they're kids, they were happy, they were running around. I don't know that they fully appreciate the sacrifice that their father has made. But I just -- I'm not going to -- if that's the criticism that people that, they have a right to in this country. But I would also suggest that we have the right to honor the people who have served this nation and the sacrifice that the families make of those who serve.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There were some quotes floating around last night from anonymous administration officials saying --\nMR. SPICER: What? (Laughter.)\nQ: What a surprise, right? (Laughter.) That part of the reason for the postponement of the announcement of the new travel ban was the positive reception of the speech, and that the administration wants the new executive order to \"have its own moment.\" Was the speech perception part of the reason --\nMR. SPICER: I will just refer you back to what I said to Anita's first question. We hadn't made an announcement. And I think that -- again, this gets back to personnel announcements, executive order announcements, other things. Until they're on the schedule, that doesn't make them official. And that's the point of making the announcement, is that we say this is where we're going and this is what we're doing. We try to provide you guys guidance. Obviously, there's a reason that we don't -- because sometimes things aren't ready, sometimes we want to make -- the President hasn't made up his final mind about executing something, or he wants to add something in. It's the same thing with the speech yesterday. I mean, we worked up until game time because the President wanted to continue to work on it.\nBut when we have announcements to make, we'll make them. Until we do, then it's not final.\nMara.\nQ: Thank you. I have two really short questions. The first one on the travel ban. The first request was for 90 days so that you could develop the new vetting regime. Thirty days have passed. I assume that means you're 30 days into this process. Does that mean that the next travel ban will ask for just the remaining time of the 90 days?\nMR. SPICER: Respectfully, I'm not -- this goes back to the last couple. I'm not going to start getting into discussions of an executive order that hasn't been announced yet. So to start talking about the specifics of something that I'm not even going to talk about the schedule of -- I'll give you credit for the try.\nQ: Okay, that's fair. My next question is on taxes. He talked about massive tax cuts for the middle class. Your Treasury Secretary at one point said there would be no absolute cut for the wealthy. What does that mean?\nMR. SPICER: It means that I think the focus is on the middle class. I think there's two things that are going to be highlighted in the tax reform. One is to make our companies and corporations and businesses more competitive so that they stay in this country and hire more people. I mean, that's --\nQ: Right, I'm talking individuals.\nMR. SPICER: I know, I know. But what I'm saying is that there's two big components are going to drive tax reform -- that being one to help companies hire more people. And then two is the focus on the individual side of the ledger is going to be on middle-income tax relief. And so I think that's what Secretary Mnuchin was referring to.\nQ: But are you saying that a wealthy person will not get a larger -- in terms of percentage -- tax cut than a middle-class person? I mean, is that how you're measuring it?\nMR. SPICER: Again, all I'm going to do is stick at the high level now and say that the principle that's guiding this is middle-class tax relief. So I'm not going to get into deciding all this yet.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. A lot has been made about the President's tone, his demeanor last night in his address to Congress in the sense that some people are describing it as very presidential; we haven't seen this side of President Trump in the early days of his presidency. Was this a one-off? Is this something we can expect from the President more often? For instance, tomorrow he is traveling down to the Newport News, Virginia area. Will we see the President Trump that we saw last night in his address to Congress, or more like the campaign-style rally that we saw down in Florida, which took place a few weeks ago?\nMR. SPICER: I think the Vice President said it best this morning. I mean, this is the President Trump, the candidate Trump, the President-elect Trump that I've known. And I think sometimes -- so I respectfully disagree in the sense that I think that the folks around him who have known him, who have gotten to know him, this is something that you see on a regular basis. And I think we're going to continue to see this.\nI think more and more -- one of the programs this morning noted that people who have been around him for a long time, this is who he is. I think he's talked about this a lot, and I know sometimes you pull random clips, but this is who he is. And I don't necessarily subscribe to are we going to see more or less of this. He cares about this country, he's got a big heart, he wants America to succeed, he wants America to be safe, he wants more Americans to get back to work. And I think you're going to hear him talk about that over and over again.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, the trade document that's out there, which suggests that the administration may take a position that would potentially ignore or look past WTO rulings. Is there any truth to this?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: What is the position?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I would just argue, look, we're a member of the WTO, we don't have a USTR in place yet. So to suggest that we're going to take any kind of trade policies -- I think, obviously, we've got some concerns with the percentage of dispute resolutions that are brought to the WTO versus other nations. But I would just -- that's sort of a fact in terms of the percentage of cases that get brought to dispute resolution at the USTR -- or, excuse me, at the WTO against the United States. But we don't have a U.S. Trade Representative, so I would say that that's not --\nQ: Like a working --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. I mean, it's not even a working. That's not -- full stop -- that is not our policy and that's not where we're going.\nYes.\nQ: Sean, this is a follow-up on the -- from the heart. Was the President's softening of his immigration stand one from the heart or one from the political handbook? Let's put it that way. And did you get ashes this morning?\nMR. SPICER: Well, as soon as -- I mean, not that I'm a big fan of sharing, but I will be going to get my ashes later in a little bit. So --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I appreciate that. I will (inaudible) in mass, and I'll let my mom know that you appreciate that, and my parish priest. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- might be able to see you --\nMR. SPICER: I try to keep a little bit of the church and state out of this.\nQ: Do you have a confession?\nMR. SPICER: Huh?\nQ: Do you a have a confession while you're up there? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: There's three parts to Lent: alms giving, penance, and prayer. And I will make sure that I spend all 40 --\nQ: Can you answer the first part of the question?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm good with -- I'm sorry I got lost in my faith. (Laughter.)\nQ: The President's softening --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. Look, I don't know that I would agree. Look, the President's comments yesterday that were that, if we can get a bill, he would like to get that done. I think he -- in the conversation that he was having with network anchors, he talked about the fact -- and, frankly, one of the anchors said, if anyone can get a deal, it would be you. Obviously, he was pleased with that because it's true. And I think he recognizes that a solution, a comprehensive solution has eluded our nation for a long time, and it's a big problem. And if he can get it, consistent with his principles, he will. And I think he made that clear, and the full context of those comments are just that, and in the speech he commented on as well.\nAnd I think there's a difference between sacrificing your principles to get a deal, and working with others, consistent with your principles to get a deal. And I think his principles remain consistent, and he understands that the benefit of actually enacting a comprehensive solution to a big problem that we face in the country, I think that's kind of where his head is at.\nZeke.\nQ: Thank you, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry. Go ahead, Zeke.\nQ: Okay. Two for you. First, following up on Monday, the ISIS review -- the status of the review process -- who was involved and what is being (inaudible)? The President -- who else is being looped into the process?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, I owed you that, and I will get back to you. The principals committee did meet. General Mattis shared his outline and ideas and comments, and he got a lot of feedback from the principals committee. And remember, that's -- and I'd need to get Michael to get back with you on that. I owe you that, and my apologies. I'll add it to my confession. (Laughter.)\nQ: And then the second is, just following the President's line of speech last night about \"the time for trivial fights is behind us\" -- does the President believe that he has also sometimes engaged in some of these trivial fights? And going forward, should we be expecting less of these fights from him with all sorts of people?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to let -- the President's vision and words last night should stand for themselves. I think he was very clear in terms of what he expects from the country.\nJessica.\nQ: The President talked about merit-based immigration last night. Can you talk a little bit more about what that means, and whether that indicates a desire to change legal immigration from a focus on family reunification to some sort of making sure they have a job in the United States? And was he also trying to imply that we don't have a merit-based immigration system?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think he was -- look, I would just refer you back to what he said. I mean, you've got countries like Canada and Australia, in particular, that have a true merit-based system, and I think he was making it clear that we currently don't necessarily -- the results of our immigration system don't yield, necessarily, one that reflects a merit-based one.\nBut I will say that there was, I think, a very substantial case that he made in terms of merit-based -- what he wants and how he wants to get there.\nJeremy.\nQ: Can I have a second? I was going to have a second question.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry.\nQ: The President also had a comment about how many factories have left the United States since China joined the WTO. Last night his number was 60,000. A week ago, on February 23rd, he used the figure of 70,000. Just wondering what the genesis of the figure is, and what the White House believes to be the number of factories. And also whether it is truly attributable to China joining the WTO or other factors, as well.\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to -- we'll get somebody to follow up with you on the cite for that, as well.\nI went to Jeremy.\nQ: Is the President considering the Pentagon and his Defense Secretary more authority to greenlight raids like the kind that we saw in Yemen? And is that, in part, driven by the political blowback that that raid had initially?\nAnd secondly, could you talk about -- the initial executive order on the travel ban called for a 30-day review period to see if they would -- you would add additional countries to the list of banned --\nMR. SPICER: I'll take the second one first. I can refer you back to Mara Liasson's question. (Laughter.)\nOn the first part, I think that he has been very clear from the get-go. He talked about some of the tactics used a while ago, and he said, I'm going to rely on General Mattis and his expertise. And I think when it comes to national security, he's got an amazing team by all standards -- whether it's Secretary Mattis, Secretary Kelly, General McMaster. There's a whole host of these -- with General Kellogg. And I think he's always talked about he's going to rely on his advisors to give him advice.\nI think at the end of the day there are certain decisions that have to be signed off by the President. And I would respectfully dispute the characterization of that, and I think we've pushed back and discussed this several times. There is -- this raid and action and mission was one that I think we have detailed very, very closely -- or carefully -- about the timeline for this, and when it was signed off on, and by whom. And it was initiated, signed off on by the previous administration in writing, with a signature to greenlight it. And it was further reviewed and concurred under this administration that the same basis for greenlighting it back then stood.\nSo, respectfully, the actual timeline and documentation does not support the accusation or the question that you're trying to ask.\nQ: And just as far as this was -- is nothing going to change as far as who greenlights certain raids?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think legally -- Jeremy, I don't want to get into specifics because I think there is certain action that requires presidential sign-off. And there's certain action in terms of echelon -- the way the military works, you have different echelons that can be signed off on certain things. And I think there are certain things that have to be signed off by the President of the United States.\nQ: (Inaudible) protocol.\nMR. SPICER: So the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off, but I think that the President has made clear -- all that being said, he relies heavily on their input, their decision-making, their opinions, and their analysis and conclusions. That's different. And I think one of the issues that you saw -- or some of the criticism that you saw last administration was that you had a lot of the combatant commanders in particular who would say, we came to a conclusion, we made the case, and we weren't allowed to move forward.\nThat's where I think the nuance that you're asking actually lies, which is --\nQ: Right, so is he making a change to address that criticism?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think his point -- it's a philosophy more than a sort of a change in policy, which is he believes that these are the experts in this field -- as he does with all of his Cabinet. I mean, I think if you ask -- in terms of foreign policy interaction, he would say, okay, I chose Secretary Tillerson because I believe he's the right guy for this job; if Betsy DeVos has an educational matter that's going to come up. He chose these highly qualified individuals because he believes in their expertise and understanding of the issues.\nI think his point and his philosophy is, generally, if they come to him with a case and lay it out, then he is -- that is going to weigh heavily on his decision-making, whereas I think in the last administration, one of the major critiques was that they would come to them and then there was a preponderance -- the preponderance of time. It would be, no, we're not going to move forward with this. So I just want to be --\nPhil.\nQ: Sean, a lot of lawmakers were heartened by the speech last night and drew a contrast from the inaugural address 40 days prior, and said that the tone was very different, the substance was different, the olive branches and outreach. Does the White House agree with that characterization? Was it on purpose? And if it was on purpose, what, over the course of those 40 days, inspired the course correction?\nMR. SPICER: It was not on purpose. There is no -- I mean, one was an inaugural. One was a joint address. They're two different speeches, and I think that they serve two different purposes in terms of what you're trying to lay out. I think the joint address serves as sort of a place hold for the State of the Union for first term -- or first year, first term.\nQ: The way he communicated.\nMR. SPICER: I understand -- you're right. And I think he wanted to lay out -- it's a much different and longer speech. He had different sort of messaging objectives at each. But I also dispute the notion on the inaugural. Like, I mean, I think that when you actually look at the critique, people will look at four or five different lines. But for the most part, for much -- the most part -- the high majority of that speech, he talked about the American people, the American worker, and the challenges that they face and where he thinks the country has kind of gotten off-track prioritizing them and his desire to put, what he called, the forgotten people back number one in line.\nAnd then so one was sort of -- that was laying out his sort of vision for the presidency. This time I think it was much more of a laying out the policies of how he's going to achieve that. And that's the purpose of a joint address. So I just -- it's two different speeches, but I just don't agree with the characterization of the inaugural in the first place.\nQ: Was there some conclusion, though, in the White House or by the President himself that that rhetorical approach early on in the presidency, that the tweets, that the speeches -- like he did at CPAC the other day, the fighting with the media -- that that was not helping and he needed to do something different?\nMR. SPICER: No. No, no, there wasn't. I just -- again, I think he -- and this particular speech was a very personal -- again, like, each speech, each speech has a different audience, a different objective. And I think for this speech, he was very personal, he was very, very much him. It was his work, it was his voice, it was his words, it was his edits, it was his suggestions.\nAnd then he had a team surrounded by him, including the Vice President, the chief of staff, Steve Miller, Steve Bannon, Jared, Ivanka was part of it. There was a -- Kellyanne, Hope -- who he would bounce ideas and objectives off of. But this was a Trump speech from his heart, as he said, that evolved over the course of the last 10 days or so. And in the last 48 to 72 hours, really accelerated, got very crisp. And it was up until about 12:15 -- excuse me, that's when I got home. (Laughter.) About 6:15 yesterday when we really started to get that real final point on it, because it was something that was very, very personal to him. But I wouldn't conflate the two and try to compare one speech with another. He looked at them as very different objectives in terms of how the speech.\nI need to run.\nQ: But, Sean, was this a reset? Was it a reset speech?\nMR. SPICER: No, it wasn't a reset speech. I need to get on. I've got some things I have to take care of. But thank you. We will, as I mentioned, expect a gaggle on the way down to Hampton Roads tomorrow, and we will see you later.\nThank you all.\nEND 12:25 P.M.

Today, the Red Cross is responsible for a remarkable 40 percent of our Nation's blood supply, teaches life-saving techniques to volunteer citizen-rescuers, and leads the world in international humanitarian aid. The Red Cross has proudly and ardently supported our military, our veterans, and their families for more than a century, delivering over 352,000 services to members of the military and veterans each year.\nThe American Red Cross is a miracle-working organization, rooted in the legacy of its gallant founder, Clara Barton, who tore down every convention at the time regarding women in battle, giving history one of the most incredible examples of courage and devotion to duty that it has ever known. Her tremendous legacy lives on through the Red Cross's assistance to hundreds of thousands of Americans affected by disasters each year. In 2016, volunteers responded to 180 significant incidents, including wildfires, storms, flooding, Hurricane Matthew, and other emergencies at all times of the day and night. They opened nearly 800 emergency shelters, served more than 4.1 million meals and snacks, and distributed more than 2.1 million relief items. Last year, the Red Cross helped 79,000 families recover from home fires that left them with no place to go.\nThe comfort, care, and relief provided by the American Red Cross serves a great mission. When those in need see that recognizable symbol of hope, the Red Cross, they see the hearts of the American people at work—an incredibly powerful thing. When they see that beacon, they know that true help is on the way, and they feel our people's mighty generosity, love, and support for their fellow human beings.\nTo perform its vital national and international roles, the Red Cross relies on volunteers and the support of the American people. The Red Cross needs our continued commitment of time, resources, and funds to be successful, and our country and the world need the Red Cross.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of service and relief organizations.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

From Dublin, California, to Limerick, Maine, from Emerald Isle, North Carolina, to Shamrock, Texas, we are reminded of the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent who contribute every day to all facets of life in the United States. Over generations, millions of Irish have crossed the ocean in search of the American Dream, and their contributions continue to enrich our country today.\nFrom our four Irish-born Founding Fathers to Thomas Francis Meagher, the Irish revolutionary who became an American hero after leading the Irish Brigade during the Civil War, Irish immigrants have shaped our history in enduring ways. Throughout the centuries, hard-working Irish Americans have contributed to America's innovation and prosperity—tilling the farms of Appalachia, working the looms of New England textile mills, and building transcontinental railroads—often overcoming poverty and discrimination and inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entrepreneurial spirit in the process. From these early beginnings rose generations of Irish Americans who continue to lead our cities, drive our economy, and protect and defend the land they embrace as their own.\nAmerican culture carries an unmistakably Irish-American imprint. Our literature, cinema, music, dance, sports, and visual arts are filled with the names and influence of great Irish Americans.\nIrish Americans should be proud of the deep cultural, historical, and familial ties that have contributed to the strength of our vibrant transatlantic relationship with Ireland. As we honor the past during Irish-American Heritage Month, we also celebrate a bright future of friendship and cooperation for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

We honor those outstanding women, whose contributions to our Nation's life, culture, history, economy, and families have shaped us and helped us fulfill America's promise.\nWe cherish the incredible accomplishments of early American women, who helped found our Nation and explore the great western frontier. Women have been steadfast throughout our battles to end slavery, as well as our battles abroad. And American women fought for the civil rights of women and others in the suffrage and civil rights movements. Millions of bold, fearless women have succeeded as entrepreneurs and in the workplace, all the while remaining the backbone of our families, our communities, and our country.\nDuring Women's History Month, we pause to pay tribute to the remarkable women who prevailed over enormous barriers, paving the way for women of today to not only participate in but to lead and shape every facet of American life. Since our beginning, we have been blessed with courageous women like Henrietta Johnson, the first woman known to work as an artist in the colonies; Margaret Corbin, who bravely fought in the American Revolution; and Abigail Adams, First Lady of the United States and trusted advisor to President John Adams.\nWe also remember incredible women like Mary Walker, the first woman to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor; Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery in 1849 and went on to free hundreds of others through the Underground Railroad; Susan B. Anthony, the publisher and editor of The Revolution and her friend, Dr. Charlotte Lozier, one of the first women medical doctors in the United States, both of whom advocated for the dignity and equality of women, pregnant mothers, and their children; Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat accelerated the modern civil rights movement; Shirley Temple Black, the famous actress turned diplomat and first chief of protocol for the President of the United States; Anna Bissell, the first woman CEO in American history; Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean; Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song and the Queen of Jazz; and Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut.\nAmerica will continue to fight for women's rights and equality across the country and around the world. Though poverty holds back many women, America cannot and will not allow this to persist. We will empower all women to pursue their American dreams, to live, work and thrive in safe communities that allow them to protect and provide for themselves and their families.\nAmerica is also mindful of the fight that continues for so many women around the world, where women are often not protected and treated disgracefully as second-class citizens. America will fight for these women too, and it will fight to protect young girls who are robbed of their rights, trafficked around the world, and exploited. Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

SPICER: I hope you guys had a great visit. I'm going to try to keep this short, obviously. We've got a short flight time home.\nThis morning, the President was glad to see Ben Carson confirmed as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and former governor of Texas confirmed as the Secretary of Energy. He looks forward to working with them to enact his bold agenda. The Secretaries will be sworn in this evening -- Secretary Carson at 5:00 p.m. and then Secretary Perry at 5:30 p.m.\nThe President was honored to visit our next aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, the Gerald R. Ford, today. As he emphasized on the campaign trail and again Tuesday in his address, expansion of the United States Armed Forces is a major priority for him, and the naval fleet is a significant portion of that. Expanding our current fleet of ships requires a collaborative partnership between the military and industry leaders to ensure maximum efficiency for taxpayers. The Navy is a vital part of the President's strategy to defeat terrorism with aircraft carriers, especially important in areas where we don't have a base, from which to launch missions, project power and protect American interest.\nHand-in-hand with military leaders and the shipbuilding community, the Trump administration will continue to build extraordinary crafts like the Gerald R. Ford, protect taxpayer dollars, and support the jobs the shipbuilding industry provides, and, most importantly, keep our nation safe. While onboard today, the President received a briefing from military leaders. He then took a tour of the ship, after which he gave remarks on the hangar bay to several thousand workers and crew members and shipyard workers, which I think you all saw.\nThe Vice President was in Ohio this afternoon with Secretary Price to discuss the President's economic agenda and especially repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster. The Vice President then participated in a listening session with small business owners and a tour of Frame USA, an American-owned and operated small business, and delivered remarks at Frame USA.\nWith that, you have a couple questions before we --\nQ: Did Sessions lie during his testimony in January, saying he didn't have any communication with the Russians?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think the senator's comments were clearly with respect to his -- he was asked about his role as a surrogate and whether he understood the campaign -- whether the campaign had contacts, and he said no. It was in his -- I think clearly with respect to his role as a campaign surrogate.\nQ: Has the President spoken with the Attorney General about any of this?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Was the President told that General Sessions should recuse himself from the Russian --\nMR. SPICER: I think that the President -- you guys got that question answered from him directly.\nQ: Should he provide more information to the committee, perhaps, to try to clarify his comments?\nMR. SPICER: I know the Attorney General is going to speak very shortly, so let's just -- I'll leave it at that. But I think the President made his views clear with you guys just a short time ago.\nQ: He doesn't have any concerns about whether he should have given a more clear response at the time?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously -- I mean, I'll let the Attorney General speak for himself. But I think that clearly if you listen to what he was responding to, he's clearly referring to his role as a campaign surrogate. That's what the question was about. And I think there's no --\nQ: So in that role as a campaign surrogate, does that mean, like, if he was asked at a campaign rally, he's a campaign surrogate? If he's at his office, he's a senator? Like, where does one role begin and the other one stop?\nMR. SPICER: We're moments away from him addressing this. And it was really silly for me to try to talk about what he may or may not think. But I think most people -- almost a clear -- I don't think there's very few other ways to read it when you look at the transcript and see the back and forth that he was clearly referring to himself. He was very -- he was clear in referring to himself as a campaign surrogate and believed that that's what the question was about. But I will let -- I mean, we're literally moments away from him addressing this, and I think the President made his view clear.\nQ: Sean, I had a big question of what he told the Senate. Is the White House annoyed that he wasn't completely forthcoming with you guys?\nMR. SPICER: Forthcoming about what? I mean, he's a United States --\nQ: (Inaudible) with the Russian ambassador.\nMR. SPICER: Wait, hold on, he's a United States senator who speaks to countless -- I mean, that's -- I mean, he was a campaign surrogate and gave the candidate at that time some ideas and advice in very important -- he had the value -- the President values his opinion tremendously, as you can tell by the fact that he wanted him in his Cabinet.\nBut the fact of the matter is, how can you do something -- I mean, he was literally conducting himself as a United States senator.\nQ: Yes, of course.\nMR. SPICER: But hold on, and let's be clear, you look at all these other senators who have had contact, and this is what senators do in the course of conducting themselves in their job. And as you've seen, whether it's some of these folks that initially came out of the gate and said that they had never done it, the list gets larger and larger.\nQ: But why wouldn't he go ahead and talk -- there was already this flap about the ambassador and Flynn. Why wouldn't Sessions put it out there?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm going to let him answer it, but I think that it was pretty clear. The question was about the campaign, and I think the -- literally, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't have the question in front of me, but I think something to the effect of the campaign comments regarding the election of -- the 2016 election. So if you haven't had anything then there's nothing -- I mean, again --\nQ: But (inaudible) saying he should recuse himself, and what about Nancy Pelosi and others saying he should resign?\nMR. SPICER: I would suggest to you that I think it's interesting that a lot of these guys -- this continues to seem to be much more of a partisan thing that we've seen over and over again. As I think I've mentioned from the -- this continues to be a question of there's no there there. And it's the same over and over and over.\nQ: You think there's no there there.\nMR. SPICER: It's not that I don't think --\nQ: (Inaudible) a Republican.\nMR. SPICER: I know who he is. I know it's -- but I'm just suggesting that I think the point is that -- again, I'm going to let the Attorney General speak for himself, but the bottom line is, is that for six months now we've heard the same thing over and over again, unnamed sources talking about nebulous, unnamed things, and keep having to say the same thing. At some point, you have to ask yourself where the \"there\" is.\nQ: Sean, we're hearing rumblings that there may not be a new travel ban coming anymore. Can you confirm that? When do you expect it then?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I've made this very clear to you guys. I'll say again what I've said before. I'm not -- and when the President has made a decision about something that he's ready for us to announce, we'll announce it, but we're not there yet.\nBut again, I think that the --\nQ: So you're taking your time a little bit more with it?\nMR. SPICER: I think that we continue to have a guiding principle doing what's right to keep the nation safe, and he's doing everything he can to consult with agencies and departments and key stakeholders.\nQ: And he's still committed to revising this travel ban that was blocked in court?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to tell you that there's nothing that has changed from what I've said in the past.\nQ: General Sessions was talking about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer. He said at the time that there should be --\nMR. SPICER: What are you talking about?\nQ: When General Sessions talked about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer, he said a special prosecutor was warranted. Why isn't a special prosecutor necessary in this case?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that the question goes back to what -- he didn't -- he was in the course of his Senate duties, did what senators do. There's no discussion -- there's nothing that would lead anyone to believe that he didn't do anything that was part of his job.\nQ: What was that meeting in regards to?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. But, I mean, there's nothing -- it was in his Senate office. There were Senate aides, from what I understand, conducting Senate business.\nQ: I don't think anybody is -- nobody is really questioning that the senator has the right to meet with the Russian ambassador in the course of his business. My question before was rather whether after -- when he's become attorney general, he didn't take the President or someone in the White House aside and say, listen, I don't think -- there was nothing untoward here but this is pertinent information given the current political climate.\nMR. SPICER: What pertinent information?\nQ: That he met with the Russian ambassador and it wasn't disclosed to the Senate.\nMR. SPICER: But he probably met with countless other ambassadors. And I think -- again, he probably met with countless other associations and constituents and --\nQ: So that's not something you would have wanted to know?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I guess my question is, why would we want to know everything that he did in conducting himself on behalf of the people of Alabama?\nQ: Okay, so you're fine with it coming out in the papers and learning about it this way?\nMR. SPICER: Learning about -- but here's my question: Learning about what? The fact of the matter is, if we're learning about the fact that he did his job as a United States senator, then that's great. I don't think there has been anything that I'm aware of at this time that suggests anything other than he did his job as a United States senator as, frankly, many of these other senators have now said, well, I met with this ambassador, or another ambassador. I mean, that's what senators do.\nQ: What about the Counsel's Office asking staff to preserve Russia-related documents, materials --\nMR. SPICER: That's a pro-forma, standard operating procedure that -- and I think, frankly, it shows how serious we take this subject.\nQ: The President hasn't spoken to Sessions either last night or today? Why not?\nMR. SPICER: Why not? I mean, I think -- I'm not --\nQ: Even though there's no there there --\nMR. SPICER: I mean, again, I think --\nQ: Have you spoken to Sessions, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- look, I'm just going to say that the Attorney General is going to make a statement very shortly, and I'll let that stand for itself.\nWe're going to go down. Thank you, guys.\nQ: Sean, do you have anything on al-Masri?\nMR. SPICER: On what?\nQ: Al-Masri's death?\nMR. SPICER: No, I -- when we land I can maybe get something. Thanks, guys.\nEND 3:54 P.M.

Mattis.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123470", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. What an honor. You know, they just gave me this beautiful jacket. They said, here, Mr. President, please take this home. I said, let me wear it. [Laughter] And then they gave me the beautiful hat, and I said, you know, maybe I'll do that. We have a great \"Make America Great Again\" hat, but I said, this is a special day, we're wearing this. Right? So I have no idea how it looks, but I think it looks good. It's a great-looking hat, just like this is a great-looking ship.\nThank you. I'm privileged to stand here today with the incredible men and women of the United States Navy. American sailors are the best warfighting sailors anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. And, Susan, I am so glad you could be with us. I know how hard you work—17 visits. And she wanted things done right, I will tell you. They told me she wanted this one done right, in honor of both of her parents, who were great, great people. And we wanted to introduce this beautiful vessel to the American people. And I wanted to be here, I wanted to be with you. So, Susan, and to your family—unbelievable job. Unbelievable.\nThe soon-to-be commissioned Gerald R. Ford USS—what a place. It's almost—it really feels like a place. You stand on that deck, and you feel like you're standing on a very big piece of land. But this is better than land. It will not only be a great symbol of American strength, but a great legacy for your father, and our former President, Gerald Ford.\nPresident Ford was a Navy man. By the way, he was also a great athlete, for those of you that didn't know. He saw action in the South Pacific during World War II. He served this country with honor—in the military, in Congress, and in the White House. The proud dignity of this ship is a fitting tribute to Gerald Ford, the man and the President.\nCongratulations to all of the men and women who helped build it. This is American craftsmanship at its biggest, at its best, at its finest. American workers are the greatest anywhere in the world. This warship, and all who serve on it, should be a source of shared pride for our Nation. We are joined today—[applause]—better believe it, right? Better believe it. Better believe it. And, by the way, we're going to soon have more coming. Lot more coming.\nWe are joined today by General Mattis, now Secretary Mattis—[applause]—where is he?—who will be charged with overseeing this great rebuilding of our military might. We will give the men and women of America's Armed Services the resources you need to keep us safe. We will have the finest equipment in the world—planes, ships, and everything else. We are going to have, very soon, the finest equipment in the world.\nWe will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war and only do one thing—you know what that is? Win! Win! We're going to start winning again.\nAdmiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, is with us today as well—great gentleman. Admiral, we're going to ensure our Navy has the resources, personnel, training, and equipment—the kind of equipment that you need. So, congratulations, Admiral. And a lot more is coming.\nLet me congratulate Captain Richard McCormack, commanding officer of the Gerald R. Ford. This ship will make an extraordinary addition to the fleet like no other—like no other. Anywhere in the world, there's nothing like this. It represents the future of naval aviation. I have no greater privilege than to serve as your Commander in Chief and the Commander in Chief of the men and women of the United States military. Great people. Great, great people.\nI salute you, and I salute our sailors. I will always support you and your mission. I will never, ever let you down. And I also have to recognize Mike Petters, president and CEO of Huntington Ingalls Industries, along with Matt Mulherin, president of Newport News Shipbuilding. They won't let you down either. They're not going to let you down either.\nTo those who serve our Nation in uniform and to those who build the instruments of our defense, I thank you on behalf of our Nation.\nAudience member. U.S.A.!\nThe President. [Laughter] I agree, I agree. [Laughter]\nOur carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas. We are standing today on 4 1/2 acres of combat power and sovereign U.S. territory, the likes of which there is nothing to compete. There is no competition to this ship. It is a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace. This ship will carry 4,500 personnel and 70 aircraft, and will be a vital component of our defense. This carrier and the new ships in the Ford class will expand the ability of our Nation to carry out vital missions on the oceans to project American power in distant lands. Hopefully, it's power we don't have to use, but if we do, they're in big, big trouble.\nThis great aircraft carrier provides essential capabilities to keep us safe from terrorism and take the fight to the enemy for many years in the future. The great Admiral Nimitz, who commanded the U.S. Pacific Fleet through the Second World War, once said, \"It is the function of the Navy to carry the war to the enemy so that we'll not be fought on U.S. soil.\" True. And it was under Admiral Nimitz's command, 75 years ago this June, that the Navy did just that at the Battle of Midway. You've all known about the Battle of Midway, where the sailors of the U.S. Navy fought with the bravery that will be remembered throughout the ages. Storied bravery throughout the ages.\nThe backbone of the American fleet at Midway was three beautiful aircraft carriers: the Yorktown, the Enterprise, and the Hornet. All three were built with American hands right here at the Newport News Shipyard. At Midway, America was greatly outnumbered by, I mean, a lot—[laughter]—and its fleet badly damaged. But the heroic deeds changed the course of history. Many brave Americans died that day, and through their sacrifice, they turned the tide of the Pacific War. It was a tough tide, it was a big tide, it was a vicious tide, and they turned it.\nCountless other Americans in that war, some of them parents and grandparents to people in this room today, came home thanks to their very heroic deeds. The sailors at Midway are part of a long line of American heroes, an unbroken chain of patriots from each generation to the next, who rose to defend our flag and our freedom.\nThat legacy continues today as American warriors protect our people from the threat of terrorism. On Tuesday, in my address to a Joint Session of Congress, I asked Congress to eliminate the defense sequester and to support my request for a great rebuilding of the United States military and the United States Navy.\nAfter years of endless budgets cuts that have impaired our defenses, I am calling for one of the largest defense spending increases in history. And by eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future, and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which, of course, is very important, right? Got to get a good deal. We don't make a good deal, we're not doing our job. The same boat for less money. The same ship for less money. The same airplanes for less money. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. Means we're going to get more of them, and we can use them.\nOur military requires sustained, stable funding to meet the growing needs placed on our defense. Right now, our aging frontline strike and strike fighters—the whole aircraft; many, many aircraft—are often more likely to be downed for maintenance than they are to be up in the sky. Our Navy is now the smallest it's been since, believe it or not, World War I. Don't worry, going to soon be the largest it's been. Don't worry. Think of that. Think of that.\nIn these troubled times, our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. That's a long time ago. In fact, I just spoke with Navy and industry leaders, and have discussed my plans to undertake a major expansion of our entire Navy fleet, including having the 12-carrier Navy we need.\nWe also need more aircraft, modernized capabilities, and greater force levels. Additionally, we must vastly improve our cyber capabilities. This great rebuilding effort will create many jobs in Virginia and all across America, and it will also spur new technology and new innovation.\nAmerica has always been the country that boldly leads the world into the future, and my budget will ensure we do so and continue to do exactly that. American ships will sail the seas. American planes will soar the skies. American workers will build our fleets. And America's military will ensure that even though the darkest nights and throughout, a bright and glowing sun will always shine on our Nation and on our people. Our Navy is great. Our Navy is great. Our people are great. Great.\nOur Republic will meet any challenge, defeat any danger, face any threat, and always seek true and lasting peace.\nMay God bless our military. May God bless our Navy. May God bless the wonderful Gerald Ford family. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-02", "title": "Remarks Aboard the Aircraft Carrier Gerald R. Ford in Newport News, Virginia"}

Thank you to my friend, Speaker Paul Ryan, for your wonderful introduction. It is great to be in Janesville, the home of the Speaker of the House of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nJanesville has almost taken on an epic category in America because what works in Janesville will work for the American people. And I'm just delighted to be with all of you today. And I'm deeply humbled by the esteem expressed by my friend and your neighbor, Paul Ryan. And let me just assure you, people all across America are grateful to the people of Janesville for continuing to send Speaker Paul Ryan to Washington, D.C. So thank you for that. (Applause.)\nI also understand that your mom, Betty, is here. Where is mom at? Can mom take a bow? Would you mind standing up? Paul Ryan's mom, everybody. This is a big deal. Turn around and wave at the media. (Applause.) Wonderful to see you and thank you for being with us today.\nThe President and I are grateful for your son's principled leadership in the House of Representatives. It seems like just yesterday, 16 years ago, when I arrived in Washington, D.C. -- just a couple of years after Paul arrived there. We were both young and dashing congressmen. (Laughter.) And one of us changed -- (laughter) -- and one of us looks exactly like he did the day you sent him.\nBut I'm deeply humbled to call your congressmen and our Speaker my friend. And I know for a fact that, Paul, your partnership with this administration is going to benefit the American people for generations to come, and we're grateful. (Applause.) Would you mind just giving him one of those standing ovations that you gave out to a few of us? He sure does deserve it. (Applause.)\nAlso, it's really great to be back in Wisconsin. Thanks to all of you, your hard work, your support and your prayers, Wisconsin voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America, and he and I couldn't be more grateful. (Applause.)\nIt was quite a campaign. And it's already been quite an administration too, hasn't it? (Laughter.) How many of you watched the President's address to the Congress on Tuesday night, show of hands. How about that? What you saw three nights ago is literally what I see every day -- the boundless optimism, the energy and unshakeable faith in the American people and the ability of the American people to make America great again. That's what you saw, and that's what inspired the nation. (Applause.)\nIt's deeply humbling for me to serve as Vice President of the United States. I'm just a small-town guy from southern Indiana. My grandfather actually immigrated to this country, came over on a boat from Ireland, went through Ellis Island and drove a bus in Chicago for 40 years. I was actually named after my grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley. That's who Michael Richard Pence got his name from.\nI mean, I can't imagine what my grandfather is thinking about looking down from glory, except that he's very surprised about his grandson. (Laughter.) But also that he was right. He was right about America. Because anybody can be anybody in \"the land of the free and the home of the brave.\" And it's a joy to be with you today.\nAnd it's a joy for me to serve as Vice President in this country because America has a President with broad shoulders and a big heart. And speaking of which, on behalf of the President of the United States, let me say thank you, Wisconsin, for your support for our new Commander-in-Chief and our new President, Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nIt was hardworking Americans like all of you who were some of our biggest supporters. Communities just like Janesville were really the wellspring of support for President Donald Trump in this campaign. And on his behalf, I want to thank you for that support, and thank you for being here today. It's a privilege to be joined by a couple other people I want to mention before I get to the body of my remarks.\nI hope you can sense the caliber, the character, the experience, and the extraordinary confidence that our new secretary of Health and Human Services brings to this task. Dr. Tom Price, President Trump and I and people across this country are grateful that you have stood up to fill this important role in the life of our nation at such a time as this. Would you thank him again? (Applause.)\nAnd I'm also honored to be joined today by another great, dedicated public servant. Senator Ron Johnson, thank you for being here, thank you for your great leadership, and congratulations. (Applause.) Congratulations on the renewal of your six-year contract here in Wisconsin. We couldn't be more pleased.\nBut I also want to thank all the business leaders who are with us today, including and maybe most especially, our host, Jane Blain Gilbertson, and the Blain's Farm and Fleet team. What an awesome company. What an awesome leader. What a great American success story. (Applause.)\nJane got together all these great people from here in Janesville, and we did some listening today, didn't we? As Paul said, we listened to the local farmers, and builders, and job creators. I really enjoyed our discussion, and I appreciate the candid feedback that you shared with us that we'll carry back to Washington, D.C.\nBut last but not least, let me just say thanks -- thanks to all of you here who are part of this incredible Farm and Fleet team. The employees and the families that came out today -- you are the backbone of our economy, of our country, of Janesville, and the President, the Speaker, and all of us are grateful for your character, your work ethic, and all you do to make this a great place to live, and to work, and to raise a family. Give yourselves a round of applause, folks. (Applause.)\nBut I'm grateful to be here to talk about family business. The President and I are going to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of small businesses across this country because I grew up in a small-business family, in a small-business town. My dad was in the gas station business. I worked at a gas station as a gas station attendant -- had my name on my shirt, right. Little blue short-sleeve shirt, when I was only fourteen years of age, and used to -- for those of you that are a little bit younger, a gas station attendant -- (laughter) -- if you could imagine, if you pulled into a gas station and someone came running toward your car, and filled it up, and washed the windshield, and checked the tires, and didn't charge you any more money for it. That was where I grew up in a small business.\nAnd as the world knows, the President grew up in a family business too. I mean, he and I both know the sacrifices that are required for a small family business in communities like where I grew up, Queens where he grew up and in -- and right here in Janesville -- long hours, hard work. And we both know the fundamental truth of our economy: When small business is strong, America is strong, and we're going fight every day for small business America. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I want you to become stronger than ever, and I'll tell you what right now. President Donald Trump is the best friend Wisconsin businesses will ever have. (Applause.) You might have gotten that impression Tuesday night, just a couple days ago. He actually talked about an employer up here. I don't know if you heard about Harley-Davidson -- (laughter) -- here in Wisconsin. The President actually hosted Harley-Davidson at the White House. It was an honor for me to join him. And you saw him talk about that in his speech to the Congress. And companies like Blain's Farm and Fleet are the engines of the economy, Harley-Davidson, and as President Trump said, whether it's going to be to kick start that engine or turn the key of that engine, we're going to restart the engine of the American economy and create jobs and prosperity and growth like never before. I promise you that. (Applause.)\nIn fact, exactly what he's doing -- it's, in fact, already happening. On day one, he went right to work on doing job-destroying policies and executive orders of the -- eight years. After years of delays, for instance, President Trump authorized the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, creating thousands of American jobs and strengthening our energy infrastructure. (Applause.) He signed legislation, thanks to the Congress and Speaker Ryan and Senator Johnson, he signed legislation already to roll back reams of red tape and he's instructed every agency in Washington, D.C., to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on businesses and entrepreneurs in America. (Applause.)\nHe's taken decisive action to end illegal immigration once and for all to strengthen our borders and uphold the laws of the United States of America. (Applause.) And businesses around America are already reacting and responding to President Trump's call to buy American and hire American, and they're doing that with optimism and investment all across the country. Literally from coast to coast, and especially here in the Midwest, companies are announcing they're keeping jobs and creating new ones -- tens of thousands of jobs literally since Election Day. It's not just the stock market that's taken a positive leap forward, but companies like Ford Motor Company, just next door in Michigan, recently announced that they were not going to do a plant in Mexico and, instead, they were going to expand a plant in Michigan. And they called it a \"vote of confidence\" in President Donald Trump and his vision for America. And other businesses are joining them. (Applause.)\nI've got to tell you, this administration has the biggest, boldest and best agenda this country has ever seen, and we're going to pass it with the support of Speaker Ryan and our great leadership in the House and in the Senate, from top to bottom. And let me make you a promise: The Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.) Despite the best efforts of some activists and town hall meetings around the country, the truth of the matter is the American people know -- Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nI heard it today. (Applause.) I heard it today. I don't know if we're going to stop by Italian House later -- (laughter) -- but I'm hungry. (Laughter.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Now we're not. (Laughter.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Paul said, \"Now we're not.\" (Laughter.) Can't announce that stuff in advance. (Laughter.) But come on, Edmund, do you got, like, a to-go thing or something there? (Laughter.) Would that be all right? Can I get Italian House to go? Would that be all right with everybody, man? (Applause.)\nWe were just hearing from Edmund a minute ago -- he's a great employer, a great American success story here in Janesville, but he talked about the weight that Obamacare has placed on his great family-owned business. And it's a weight that's been placed on businesses and employers all across this country, let alone the weight it's placed on American families.\nI mean, literally, it literally is just a long list of broken promises, isn't it? I mean, remember all the promises about Obamacare? They told you the cost of health insurance would go down, right? Not true. They told us if you like your doctor, you could keep him. Not true. They told us if you like your health insurance plan, you could keep it. Not true. I mean, talk about your fake news. I mean, the truth is -- the truth is just virtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken.\nToday, Americans are paying $3,000 a year more on average for their health insurance than when Obamacare was passed into law. And premiums are skyrocketing -- last year by more than 25 percent on average around the country, millions have lost their plans and lost their doctors. And not only that, Obamacare, as Edmund was describing, is a job-killer, and everybody knows it.\nThe last few years, it's been hard enough to get ahead and Obamacare has only made it much harder and, in many ways, if not impossible for many small businesses. The endless premium hikes, the reams of red tape eat up time and money that would be better spent growing your business and benefitting your workers. And every year the burden grows, so do the hard choices that you have to make.\nBut not for long. I'm going to make you a promise -- you heard the President say it -- and give direction to the Congress. And it's just going to start happening in just a few days. We're going to repeal Obamacare once and for all, and eliminate all its mandates and taxes and intrusion into your personal lives and into the lives of your business. (Applause.)\nAnd best of all -- best of all, the President directed the Congress right after that election today to -- at the same time that we repeal Obamacare, we're going to replace it with something that actually works and lowers the cost of health insurance for every American. (Applause.) The President and I want every American to have access to quality, affordable health insurance. That's why we're going to pass a better law that lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government. And we've got an incredible team working literally every single day around the clock to get that done. In Secretary Price, America has one of the leading experts on healthcare in the country -- I hope you picked up he's a medical doctor. (Laughter.) All right? I mean, how many times in Washington -- this is only the third time in the history of the Department of Health and Human Services that a physician has led that Department.\nThe President and I are working with him, with Speaker Ryan and his outstanding team in the House of Representatives with Leader McConnell, Senator Johnson, with all of our leaders in Congress, and we're putting the finishing touches on our plan, even as this weekend rolls out. A better plan for a brighter future that's built on a foundation of individual freedom and personal responsibility will replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nThe President talked about it the other night, but you know the outlines -- we're going to give Americans the freedom to buy health insurance that's best for you and end the era of government-mandated health insurance in this country. We're going to let you buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. That's how you bring down the cost of health insurance -- you create a national marketplace and then you get that little lizard and you get Flo on television -- (laughter) -- and let them start selling cheaper health insurance to every American. That's the American way. (Applause.)\nWe'll make also -- make sure, I promise you, that Americans struggling with preexisting conditions have access to the coverage and the care that they need. And we'll give states the flexibility and the freedom and the resources they need to take care of our most vulnerable. You know, just the other day, I was talking to one of my favorite elected officials in America, Governor Scott Walker. (Applause.) I mean, what is in the water here in Wisconsin? Governor Scott Walker is not only leading the association of fellow governors of his party across the country, but he's a recognized national leader and I'm honored to call him a friend.\nAs a former governor myself, he and I both know that every state is unique. The challenges here in Wisconsin are different than they are down in Illinois, different than they are in the state of Indiana, Minnesota. And what Scott Walker is doing is he's pulled together governors from around the country, we met last weekend in Washington, D.C. And we're working on ensuring that when we repeal and replace Obamacare, that we're going to allow states to have the flexibility to craft state-based solutions that will work for the people of their individual states. What will work in Wisconsin is better designed by the people of Wisconsin for the needs of the most vulnerable in this state. And I'm grateful for his leadership. (Applause.)\nAnd despite what the other side is saying, all the -- creating anxiety for Americans, the President said it last fall in Philadelphia, he said it again this week: We're going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system that finally puts the American people first.\nSo it's about healthcare right out of the gate. And our 45th President has said that's the number-one priority, and we're going right to work on it in just a matter of days. But President Trump's agenda doesn't stop there. I could keep you here the rest of the afternoon to tell you about all the things the President planned, but let me touch on a few.\nI loved it when he was out campaigning in Wisconsin and I was a little bit myself. President Trump, you see, had a three-part agenda: Jobs, jobs and jobs. And this President is going to get this economy moving again by passing the biggest package of tax relief since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nWith the strong support of Speaker Ryan and Senator Ron Johnson, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms. We're also going to keep rolling back job-killing regulations, rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C.\nWe're going to end wasteful government spending and restore fiscal responsibility to our nation's capital. We're going to pass an infrastructure package so that America, once again, has the best roads, bridges, highways, airports that we've ever had in the history of this nation. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I believe that roads mean jobs. And not just road jobs; when you have the right infrastructure, this builder who's become President knows the right investments and the right infrastructure is going to make for a more prosperous Wisconsin and a more prosperous America.\nAnd, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it: Thanks to President Trump, this economy is going to grow faster than ever before. But making America great again also means restoring safety to our streets, keeping our country secure, and President Trump hasn't wasted any time on that either.\nI'll tell you what, in my lifetime, I couldn't be more proud, because I've never seen at this level -- and they know it -- President Trump stands with the men and women who serve in law enforcement all across this country like no one I've ever met. (Applause.) We're going to stand with those men and women who keep our communities safe every single day. And we're going to continue to take steps to make sure that people that are coming into this country don't represent a threat to our families or to our way of life.\nPresident Trump is standing tall with our allies, standing up to our enemies. He's also working to rebuild our military. I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. (Applause.) And truth of the matter, in recent years, we've seen budget cuts that have failed to provide our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines with the resources that they need to do their jobs. That's all about to change.\nUnder President Donald Trump, with the leadership of this Congress, we're going to rebuild our military. We're going to restore the arsenal of democracy. We're going to make sure our armed forces have the resources and training they need to protect our nation starting right now. (Applause.)\nMy friends, President Trump is keeping his promises, promises he made to the people of Wisconsin and promises he made to the American people. And that includes one of his most consequential promises. Out on the campaign trail, there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. The President said that he would promise to name someone to the Supreme Court in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. And I promise you, in Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump has kept his word to nominate a jurist who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States of America. And we look forward to him being confirmed by the United States Senate. (Applause.)\nHealthcare reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, taking steps to make America secure, ensuring that the highest court in the land upholds our highest ideals. That's what it looks like to make America great again. And President Trump is fighting to make that happen every single day, every single moment. And we're going to continue fighting.\nNow, we're hearing from plenty who want to stick with the status quo, whether it be on healthcare or other issues -- whether it's the media, the establishment, insiders and the rest, they have no problem standing in the way of change. But trust me, whatever challenges face us today, we're going stay in the promise-keeping business. And President Trump is going to deliver on this moment for the people of the United States of America.\nAnd we're going to make America more prosperous again. We're going to have a better healthcare system that respects the doctor-patient relationship and harnesses the power of the private marketplace. We're going to make America safe again. And with your help and with God's help, I promise you, Wisconsin, I promise you, Janesville, we're going to make America great again.\nThank you very much. Thank you for coming out today. And just God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-03-03", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on President Trump's Vision for the Future in Janesville, Wisconsin"}

SANDERS: All right, I'll walk through -- I'll keep the opening quick since I know we're on tight time, but the President is going to spend his day here in Orlando, Florida, speaking with students, parents, teachers and administrators on how we can improve our education system and the importance of school choice. We'll be at the St. Andrew Catholic School. The President will then proceed to Palm Beach for a working weekend and returning on Sunday night to the White House.\nThe Vice President will be Wisconsin today for a listening session with Wisconsin business leaders and their employees, and attending with him are Secretary Price and Speaker Ryan. Also attending with the President today in Florida Secretary DeVos, Florida Governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, who is also on the plane with us today -- as well as Secretary DeVos.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nQ: Is there any reaction from the White House to arrests in connection with the threats against Jewish community centers?\nMS. SANDERS: Is there any what? I'm sorry.\nQ: Reaction from the White House to the arrests.\nMS. SANDERS: I know that happened just within the last few hours and so I will get back to you on that if there's anything specific from us. But right now, it's still too early for us to say much about it. Let the process work.\nQ: Can you see why the White House decided that it's okay for the Keystone XL pipeline not to be built with American steel?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, the way that the executive order is written is actually -- and I'll get you the exact language, but you can probably all have it in your inboxes if you want to look back. But it's specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired. And since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back. But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that executive order.\nQ: Vice President Pence in a new story out of Indiana -- it was revealed that he used a private email server --\nMS. SANDERS: Actually, it was --\nQ: -- or a private email account --\nMS. SANDERS: Very different.\nQ: Sorry. A private email account, but it was hacked. How is that different from what Hillary Clinton did? What's the difference?\nMS. SANDERS: There's lightyears of difference. Number one, he was a governor -- he wasn't a federal employee, which means the laws are different. It's subject to Indiana law, not federal law. Second, he's a governor, which means he wasn't handling classified information like she was. And third, all of his emails he turned over specifically to be archived, which is why anybody even knows about the account. He did everything to the letter of the law in Indiana, turned all of his emails over, unlike Hillary Clinton who lost at least 30,000, who knows how many more, had a private server, and had classified information, which he didn't have. I mean, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison.\nQ: Sarah, on Russia and Sessions, is the President --\nMS. SANDERS: I can't believe it took us that long.\nQ: I know, right?\nMS. SANDERS: Goodness.\nQ: Is the President satisfied that recusal is enough for the Attorney General? He seemed to say in his statement he didn't even think that that should have happened and yet the Attorney General took that step on his own. And there are reports about other members of the President's campaign staff that had also had connections --\nMS. SANDERS: Campaign volunteers, but yes.\nQ: -- who have been volunteers. I mean, at what point is there a \"there\" there, as Sean said there wasn't. I mean, at what point is -- I mean, there's so much out there.\nMS. SANDERS: Is there really? I mean, please explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly 80 ambassadors attended is a story. I guess that part is kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity. I mean, Chuck Schumer sitting, having drinks with Putin and that's not a news story, but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where there's, again, dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy, I guess.\nQ: Jeff Sessions was more than a campaign volunteer, right?\nMS. SANDERS: As a senator, he obviously in his official capacity met with the ambassador but, again, that was a senator, not as a campaign official. And so to try to muddy the waters in that way is I think pretty unfair to the Attorney General.\nQ: Why is the administration just now telling people about the meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower? It seems like a little late, given that there was all this stuff about whether Flynn had had conversations with him.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think this, again, was a courtesy meeting. They were part of over a hundred different meetings during the transition. This wasn't like a secret -- it was just -- frankly, I didn't know about it and so I don't think anybody saw it as a big deal. There was no policy discussion. It was an introductory, courtesy meeting, which we did literally hundreds over the course of the transition.\nQ: With other ambassadors? How many other ambassadors?\nMS. SANDERS: I would have to get a specific number, but I know that there were dozens of other ambassadors.\nQ: There were a number of reporters who are staked out at Trump Tower watching people go up the elevators. No one saw the Russian ambassador. Did he use a separate entrance? And if so, why?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, but I'll check and find out, and let you guys know.\nQ: To go back to Pence and the email issue for a second, is the White House certain that he's not using personal email as Vice President? And has the White House sort of checked in with all the Cabinet Secretaries and people to talk to them about using personal email versus government email?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, I know that we've all had the training on security and ethics training, and I'm also -- I will ask specifically that question, but I know that the Vice President is following the law as it's required by him.\nQ: Can you say one thing on the education event today -- Nancy DeVos and her --\nQ: Betsy.\nQ: I'm sorry -- Betsy DeVos, sorry, and her support for school choice has obviously been controversial with teachers unions, with a lot of the Democrats. Is this a sort of kickoff for the President in his push to try to help her adopt school choice nationwide?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the point of today is exactly what it says -- it's a listening session. It's to talk about ideas and reforms that have worked, particularly at this school, which I think you guys will get the opportunity to see that.\nLook, the number-one priority for education with the President has been consistent from day one. It hasn't changed, and that's to make the power and the central focus be more on the parents and the local level, and less at the federal level. And today is part of that process.\nQ: Is there any legislation or anything that he is going to pushing on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Not as of today. We'll certainly keep you guys posted if we're making any legislative announcements or bill signings.\nQ: There are reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting the White House later this month. Can you confirm that today?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, she will be there. I believe the date is March 14th, and that is confirmed.\nQ: What will they be discussing?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get ahead of their conversations, but we'll certainly provide readouts after that meeting. And I believe we plan to have a press conference with that, and they can address that directly.\nQ: The New York Times story about the debate over climate change and the Paris climate deal, whether the President is going to pull the U.S. out of that deal -- can you tell us where the President's mind is on that, and if we're expecting an announcement anytime soon?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of the President, and he hasn't made an announcement on that, but you guys are always the first to know.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about the RNC event tonight? What the President is going to do or say there, and anything else that he's going to do this weekend?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. I know that it's a fundraiser. This will be the first fundraiser he has attended as President. And it's -- as you would imagine -- like pretty much every other fundraiser. The goal is to raise money for the Republican Party, and I don't expect tonight to be any different.\nQ: Is there any access for us?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so, as of now. I think the standard policy has usually been not to have press at fundraisers, but I'll check and let you guys know.\nQ: And anything else this weekend?\nMS. SANDERS: I know we have some other stuff. Stephanie, who will be with you guys through the rest of the weekend, will keep you posted throughout Sunday.\nQ: Any update on the travel ban EO?\nMS. SANDERS: We don't have an announcement yet, but again, we'll let you know when we're ready to roll that out.\nQ: Any portions of his schedule for next week that you can preview today?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we will have a week-ahead guidance later tonight, and so we'll get that to you guys then.\nAnything else?\nQ: More on Sessions and Russia: The President said he learned about this, as the rest of us were learning, through media reports. Same thing with Flynn. He didn't know about the calls and the fact that they were discussing sanctions. Does the President feel like he has a full understanding of what his campaign, what his staffers, what his administration has done in terms of its relationship with Russia? Is there anything that the President feels that he doesn't know yet?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so, and I think the big point here is that the President himself knows what his involvement was, and that's zero. And I think he's the primary person that should be held responsible, and he had no interaction, and I think that's what the story should be focused on.\nThanks, guys.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: You bet.\nEND 12:54 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-03-03", "title": "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

Ford  for broadcast on March 3. * White House correction.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123453", "text": "My fellow Americans: I'm joining you today from the deck of what will be our Nation's newest aircraft carrier, the soon-to-be commissioned Gerald R. Ford. And as you can see, I'm wearing a jacket and a hat that they just gave me. Not really used to it, but it feels awfully good. I'm very proud of it, actually.\nOur carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our totally unparalleled strength at sea. This beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation, and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades and decades to come.\nA famous aviator once wrote that, to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a \"desire for the vast and endless sea.\" So true.\nIn the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country—and rebuild it we will.\nOn Tuesday, before a Joint Session to [of]* Congress, I laid out a version—I hope you all watched—for how to accomplish that national rebuilding. My vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts on our military.\nWe must give our sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen the tools, equipment, resources, and training they need to get the job done and get it done right, especially in these very dangerous times.\nThe Active Duty Army has been reduced by more than 85,000 men since 2009, and we have over 18,000 fewer Active Duty marines. Air Force, it's the smallest it's been since 1947, and their planes are, on average, nearly 30 years old, if you can believe that. Our Navy's fleet is the smallest it's been since World War I, and that's a long time ago. Frontline Navy and Marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky.\nWe cannot afford to continue down this path. My budget will give America's Armed Forces the resources they need to achieve full and total military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges—and meet them, we will. Investing in the military means investing in peace; because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it.\nMost importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform. They are the best of us. They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known, and we will support them every single step of the way.\nThese are truly exciting times. Amazing opportunities are unfolding before us: To strengthen our military, to reboot our economy, and to bring back our jobs. If we all work together and put our country first, then anything is possible. Let us seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal.\nMay God bless the men and women of our military, and may God bless the United States of America, the country we love.", "timestamp": "2017-03-03", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 1:51 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Bishop John G. Noonan of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando; and Gov. Richard L. Scott of Florida.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123469", "text": "The President. Well, first of all, I want to thank you very much. Great job. Really a fantastic job. We just did a tour. I was given a couple of beautiful cards by the students—really well done. And I appreciate it.\nAnd Bishop Noonan, thank you so much. A very powerful man, and I—the most powerful man, right? [Laughter] And I appreciate it very much for your uplifting prayer. I have to say that your support of schools like St. Andrews Catholic School has been incredible. Everyone talks about it. They talk about you. You understand how much the students benefit from full education, one that enriches both the mind and the soul—it's a combination—and that's a good combination.\nLatrina, I want to just thank you. The job you've done is incredible. Everyone—we've been talking about, you actually you have a big reputation in Florida. You do know that, right? [Laughter] For your talent and a lot of other things. But I see it—and for your love of what you do. Because I could see as soon as I met you, the love that you have for what you do——\nSt. Andrew Catholic School Principal Latrina Peters-Gipson. Thank you.\nThe President. —— is really fantastic. So I want to thank you very much. And Superintendent Fortier—where is superintendent?\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Orlando Superintendent of Schools Henry Fortier. Right here.\nThe President. Where is superintendent? You have been—come here. You have been fantastic. And the job you're doing and willing to do is going to be—I think with what's happening and with people like Marco and Rick Scott—in the presence and seeing this today, I mean, it just—it's going to go further and further because I know they're big fans.\nSo I'm grateful to have everybody here today. I'm also very pleased and—where is Rick Scott? Right over here, Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio and, as you know, Secretary DeVos—she was approved a couple of weeks ago. And she's the one that we all report to when it comes to education. And I know you're going to have a fantastic relationship with the Secretary, and that's going to be a lot of good things for your school and for the entire system.\nSt. Andrews Catholic School represents one of the many parochial schools dedicated to the education of some of our Nation's most disadvantaged children. But they're becoming just the opposite very rapidly through education and with the help of the school choice programs. This month, we commemorate the thousands of peaceful activists for justice who joined Martin Luther King on the march from Selma to Montgomery. On that day, Reverend King hoped that inferior education would become, as he said, quote, \"a thing of the past.\" And we're going to work very much for the future and what he predicted would be the future. As I've often said in my address to Congress and just about anyplace else I can speak, education is the civil rights issue of our time. And it's why I've asked Congress to support a school choice bill. And we've come a long way. I think we really—we're right out there and we're ahead of—we're ahead of schedule in so many ways when it comes to education. And, again, Betsy is going to lead that—you're going to lead that charge, right?\nSecretary of Education Elisabeth P. DeVos. You bet. The President. You'll do a fantastic job. Denisha Merriweather is with us today and you were so wonderful the other night.\nUniversity of West Florida graduate Denisha Merriweather. Thank you.\nThe President. That was quite a night. I will say that, Denisha. I was honored that Denisha joined Melania and myself as our guest to my address to Congress. Denisha is the first in her family to graduate high school and college, and is about to complete her master's degree in social work, right? And Denisha, we want millions more to have the same chance to achieve the great success that you're achieving right now. And you think that can be done, I'll bet, right?\nMs. Merriweather. Of course.\nThe President. Look at that. [Laughter] Look at those eyes light up. That's fantastic. So I want to thank all of the parents and teachers and students in St. Andrews and all of the graduates that are with us today. It's a special place. It's also a special State. Florida, to me, is a very, very special, special State. I mean, I know those people back there—they know why I like it so much. But we've had a lot of success in Florida, and I love it. It's my second home. I'm here all the time. And we have the southern White House in Florida. [Laughter] And we get a lot of work done—believe me, there's not rest at the southern White House—it's all work. And we love this State. And we love this State, the way it's managed between Marco and Rick and some of the others. They're doing a great job, and we appreciate it very much. And thank you.

So, that's the plan we've been working on, and we look forward to moving it very, very soon.\"\nOMB Director Mick Mulvaney on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures: \"The President set out to undo the military sequester, that's exactly what this does.\"\nDIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY: \"I have seen the same data and heard the same things that the general mentioned. It does make one wonder what the Obama Administration did with all the money that we spent on defense over the course of the last eight years, but I will tell you this Maria, in arriving at the $54 billion, there's a couple of different things that got us to that number. First, it was the number that the President promised during the campaign. It's the number that would be for the military, $603 billion if there were no military sequester. That was very specific. The President set out to undo the military sequester, that's exactly what this does. We sat down with the Defense Department, with the Pentagon, to go over how much money they actually needed to start solving some of these problems. We are not going to undo the damage that has been done in just one year. This is the first step of several years of additional defense spending this President wants to see, but, again, we worked in close lock step with the DOD to arrive at this number. ... I'm just saying we managed to do so, and I don't want to minimize this at [missing word??]. It would be easy to take any number out of the air, but it would inevitably add to the deficit this year. What I don't want to get lost in all of this is the President's commitment to move money within our current budget to prioritize defense. He's doing this $54 billion of additional spending for the military without adding to the already large 2018 budget. That's exactly what he said he would be do and that's what he's delivering.\"\nCounselor to the President Kellyanne Conway on CBS' Sunday Morning on the President's Joint Address: \"It is President Trump who was writing and rewriting entire passages, and he really wanted it to be in his voice.\"\nNORAH O'DONNELL: \"It was called a presidential speech and he's been President for five weeks.

But I will tell you that it [was] President Trump who was writing and rewriting entire passages, and he really wanted it to be in his voice. And he works with [a] brilliant speech writer, Stephen Miller, who is able to really reflect the President's tone and content.

Trump today congratulated Exxon Mobil Corporation on its ambitious $20 billion investment program that is creating more than 45,000 construction and manufacturing jobs in the United States Gulf Coast region.\nPresident Trump made a promise to bring back jobs to America. The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning.\n\"This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,\" the President said. \"Many of the products that will be manufactured here in the United States by American workers will be exported to other countries, improving our balance of trade. This is a true American success story. In addition, the jobs created are paying on average $100,000 per year.\"\nDarren W.

Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022.\nExxon Mobil's projects, once completed and operating at mature levels, are expected to have far-reaching and long-lasting benefits. Projects planned or under way are expected to create more than 35,000 construction jobs and more than 12,000 full-time jobs. These are full-time manufacturing jobs that are mostly high-skilled and high-paying, and have annual salaries ranging from $75,000 to $125,000.

Another quiet weekend. (Laughter.)\nQ: You sure you don't want to do this on camera? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: The President signed a new executive order this morning that continues to protect the nation from terrorists entering into the United States, and a related presidential memorandum. As we've always maintained, the executive order was fully lawful in the first place, and we would have won the related legal cases on the merits. But rather than leave America's security in limbo while the litigation dragged on, some estimates having that go up to potentially a year, the President acted to protect the national security by issuing a new executive order that addresses the court's concerns, some of which merely involve clarifying the intent of the original executive order.\nAfter reviewing the facts and in thorough consultation with the Cabinet, the President had concluded these actions are necessary to protect the United States from those who, unfortunately, wish to do us harm.\nTwo areas that I want to highlight in the executive order. There will be a 90-day suspension of travel to the United States by nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, during which time the Department of State and Homeland Security will conduct a review to determine how we can improve the screening process for foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States.\nThese six countries have been previously identified by Congress and the Obama administration as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism. Specifically, Iran, Sudan and Syria have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Libya is an active combat zone where violent extremist groups thrive in ungoverned territory. Portions of Somalia have been a safe haven for terrorist groups. Most countries don't even recognize the Somali documents.\nYemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the government and Iran-backed armed opposition. Both ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and carry out hundreds of attacks.\nThese governments simply cannot or not adequately supply satisfactory information about their own nationals. In the absence of adequate information from these governments, the President has had to act to protect the security of the American people.\nAfter the original executive order, Iraq's government took steps to increase their cooperation with our immigration authorities and improve their vetting process, leading them to be removed from the list of countries covered by the temporary travel suspension. We hope other countries will also take proactive action to ensure the security of all of our nations.\nThis is proof of both the need for and the effectiveness of the President's actions. There are a number of exceptions to this temporary travel suspension. The order explicitly states that the suspension does not apply to, one, green card holders; two, foreign nationals currently in the U.S.; three, foreign nationals currently holding valid visas; four, foreign nationals who are dual citizens of a designated country traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country; and last, foreign nationals who have been granted asylum or admitted as refugees previously.\nThere will also be a temporary 120-day suspension of the United States refugees' admissions program. More than 300 people who have entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the FBI. We must find a way to better screen refugee applicants to maintain the safety of our own communities.\nThis suspension will temporarily reduce the investigative burdens on the agencies that participate in our refugee program, allowing them to properly review and revise their standards and practices.\nIn regard to both of these provisions, the President places his full faith and trust in the experience and knowledge of his Secretary of State and his Secretary of Homeland Security. This order makes it clear that they have broad authority to grant waivers based on their expert judgments. This suspension does not apply to refugees already scheduled for travel by the Department of State, which is explicitly stated in the text of the executive order. Additionally, this suspension does not treat Syrian refugees different than any other refugees. It does not separately address the persecution of religious minorities, but does permit waivers in the cases of undue hardship.\nThis order was drafted in close consultation with the relevant agencies. It also includes a delay-effective date of March 16th, giving those involved in its enforcement even more time to facilitate an orderly rollout.\nWe welcome those who come to our country wishing to contribute and share in our nation's prosperity and wellbeing, but we cannot allow our immigration system to become a vehicle for admitting people who intend to do us harm. It is the President's solemn duty to protect the American people, and President Trump has taken an important step in securing our borders through this order.\nMoving on to today, the President had a full day of meetings with the Cabinet and members of his staff. The President received his intelligence briefing this morning. He had a call earlier with the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, where they discussed regional security challenges. The Prime Minister thanked the President for his strong stance on anti-Semitism during his joint address to Congress last week.\nThe President had lunch with the Vice President, and, as I'm speaking to you now, he is beginning a meeting with the Secretary of State. Later today, he'll have meetings with his National Economic Council and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shulkin. This evening, he'll have dinner with OMD Director Mulvaney and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, where he will talk about the repeal-and-replace efforts regarding Obamacare.\nWith that, I'll be glad to take a few questions.\nQ: Follow-up on the executive order? Have you told --\nMR. SPICER: John Roberts.\nQ: Thank you. (Laughter.) You told us -- I figured since it's just a gaggle -- you told us many times that the President was going to continue with the case in Seattle federal court, yet paragraph 13 in the new EO says he's going to revoke the original one. What changed?\nMR. SPICER: As you know, he met with his team over the weekend down in Mar-a-Lago -- general counsel, Secretary Sessions, Secretary Kelly, Stephen Miller, other members of the team -- where they discussed -- continued discussing the current executive order, as well as the strategy. And they made a determination that it was best to pursue this track.\nAnd again, I think, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we continue to maintain that the order was fully lawful but there were some legal hurdles that we'd have to potentially cross in terms of enjoinment and things like that.\nSo it was discussed with the President Saturday, and he made a decision that this was how he wanted to proceed going forward, based on the advice and counsel of his team.\nQ: DOJ has informed the 9th circuit of the existence of the new executive order. Will they move to dismiss the 48 cases that are facing that original order?\nMR. SPICER: That's a good question. I know that there's the issue of both the 9th circuit and then the other ones. And I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't know what posture they're going to take, so we'll go forward.\nMargaret.\nQ: I was just going to say, would you be able to let all of us --\nMR. SPICER: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'd be glad to let everybody know.\nQ: I've got a question too but I can wait until he's finished, it's fine.\nMR. SPICER: John, are you done?\nQ: Oh, I'm done.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. See how much nicer this is? Margaret.\nQ: Oh, thank you. Well, actually I'd like to move away from this subject to the other subject.\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: Is the President going to clarify what he meant when he accused President Obama and White House officials of doing wiretaps? Is that what he meant, or did he mean that he thinks there were wiretaps that the FBI authorized? And does he want to kind of, like, amend his previous statement?\nMR. SPICER: I think the statement that we issued yesterday where -- President Donald J. Trump is requesting as part of the investigation of Russian activity that congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is continued.\nHe wants Congress to look into this. I've spoken to the President again today. He would ask that they, additionally, look into this issue of leaks of classified and other information coming from the government. He believes that it undermines our national security and that Congress -- the intelligence communities in Congress, using their oversight authority, look into these pervasive leaks of national security -- of classified information. So he would do that.\nI would note, it's interesting that when you look at what former DNI Clapper said on \"Meet the Press,\" when he was asked if there was any evidence that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russian government while the Kremlin was working to influence the election, his quote was, \"Not to my knowledge.\"\nI think we've continued to see people who have been briefed and are aware of these stories that have existed -- Congressman Chairman Nunes of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton of the -- he's on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, Marco Rubio -- you name it, on and on and on, have said that the information that they've been provided -- and this is -- I get it, there's two separate issues here. But I think on the first one, you saw over and over again the continued comments by people who are in the know or have been in the know on that situation saying that there was no knowledge. Conversely, you saw former Attorney General Mukasey come out and talk about -- that it's pretty clear that there was some sort of surveillance or wiretaps that had to have existed.\nAll that being said, I think that's why the President is asking Congress, the intelligence committees to use their oversight authority to further understand what's in this.\nI'm sorry.\nQ: And so --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not sorry but I knew you --\nQ: No, no, no -- yeah. Just before we move on -- okay, so for now, the President is not amending what he tweeted.\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And Jim Comey, in the meantime, I guess wanted Justice to knock it down. Has the President talked to Jim Comey?\nMR. SPICER: I'll be honest with you, I have not seen anything aside from another report based on anonymous sources that that actually happened. So aside from anonymous sources saying that a conversation happened, I'm not aware that that occurred. I don't know that we're aware that that occurred. And I, frankly, don't see anything on the record that show that that actually occurred.\nSo just to be clear, this is one of the problems that I think occurred in the whole first set of stories. People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources say they do. We have started to become a series of believing all of these stories, and yet -- I've addressed this in the past -- there's nothing there to substantiate it.\nIn fact, all of the people, from -- I mean, Clapper's comment, \"Not to my knowledge.\" You saw Nunes, Rubio, all these senators and House members that have been briefed by the FBI coming out and saying, we have not seen anything, either. At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous off-the-records.\nZeke. Oh, I'm sorry --\nQ: Sean --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, I just saw the top of a head. Hallie, I'm going to get to you, don't worry. I'm sorry, that was my bad.\nQ: It's okay, it's all right. So explain this to me, then. You're talking about not using anonymous sources. What is, then, the sourcing for the President's tweet on Saturday morning?\nMR. SPICER: As I said, I think, look --\nQ: And does he believe it's a FISA warrant. Is it some other -- of surveillance?\nMR. SPICER: It could be FISA. It could be surveillance. There's no cameras, slow it down.\nQ: So he doesn't know?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think he has made it clear that there are continued reports that have been out there. I'm not going to continue to -- I think the President made it clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this. I think there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources.\nQ: But what sources --\nMR. SPICER: Okay. Sara, you're not on camera. You don't need to jump in. We'll get to your question in turn. Hold on.\nThe answer is, is that the President has made it clear he wants Congress to look into this. And we're encouraging the House and Senate intelligence committees to use their oversight capabilities and look into this.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Sean, does he not know whether -- what kind of surveillance it was?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's no question that something happened. The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever. But there's been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred. And I think that that's why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this. And I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some of this happened without the existence of surveillance.\nQ: But when he published his tweet --\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: -- did he know what kind of surveillance?\nMR. SPICER: All I'm telling -- like I said, I'm going to put a pin in this and say, the statement yesterday made it very clear that he wants House and Senate Intelligence Committee members to use their oversight authority to look into this situation.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Has the President ever said there's hypocrisy and a double standard in the reporting of things? For example, about alleged Russian involvement in U.S. elections, and then on the other hand, relatively little attention paid to the leaking of conversations with world leaders that are classified? And does the leaking of his conversations with world leaders bother him and make him want to investigate that as well?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think he is very concerned about that. There is obviously information that affects national security that has been leaked out that concerns him. I mean, it's -- and I think when you've seen some of the leader calls being leaked out that are sort of congratulatory or not necessarily dealing with state secrets or national security, that's one thing to seem -- but it gives you pause and concern to realize that, if you're talking about something of national security, of something that affects two of our different economies or countries, that -- whether it's China or North Korea, whether you're actually talking to them or talking about them with another leader, that there is obviously concern that those calls are getting leaked out. And I think that's why the President is also now asking Congress to additionally use its oversight authorities to also look at those leaks and wonder why that's happening.\nSo I think he is concerned. I think we've said it several times before, and it's obviously something that is of major concern. And, frankly, when you recognize the potential that that could have on the safety of our country, it should give everyone pause.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, two topics for you here. I want to clarify some questions again from my colleagues. Has the President spoken with the FBI director about the allegations he made Saturday morning, and does he have confidence in his FBI?\nMR. SPICER: To the best of my knowledge, I'm almost 100 percent certain that he has not, but I've not specifically asked him. I'm not aware that that occurred. Obviously I'll give myself -- and I'd be glad to get back, but I have not known that that existed. So I'm giving myself the ability to get back to you on this, but I'm not --\nQ: And all of us.\nMR. SPICER: And all of you. We're making a list. But I am not aware that that actually happened.\nQ: And the confidence question. Does he have confidence in his director?\nMR. SPICER: There's nothing that I have been told by him that would lead me to believe that anything is different than when it was prior.\nQ: And before I get to the second topic, a clarification here. You're talking about the President wanting to go to Congress, specifically on the wiretapping question, but this is information that is held by the executive branch. So why would the President, if it's information the executive branch has --\nMR. SPICER: Because I think that there's -- like, again, and I'm not going to -- I want to stay in my wheelhouse here. But my understanding is, is that the President directing the Department of Justice to do something with respect to an investigation that may or may not occur with evidence may be seen as trying to interfere. And I think that we're trying to do this in the proper way, and that's --\nQ: So his tweets about it -- sort of saying that this information exists does not --\nMR. SPICER: That doesn't interfere with an investigation.\nSo, Zeke.\nQ: Okay, the second topic was actually on the immigration executive order. The President back in January tweeted about a one-week delay on the travel ban, would have let \"bad dudes\" enter the country. This particular revised order doesn't go into effect for another 10 days.\nMR. SPICER: The 16th.\nQ: So what changed? How does that under -- does that undercut your argument that the nation was at risk?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I would argue that the court kind of undercut our argument by not reading the U.S. code the way it's intended to. But I think we lost the element of surprise way back when we said we were going to issue a second executive order.\nQ: So that's what it was about, the element of surprise?\nMR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely. I think we said at the beginning. The whole reason that we did it in the way that we did was because if you -- started to telegraph it. But I think that when we started talking about a second executive order a couple of weeks back, I think that that generally took away -- whether it was done on Friday or Sunday or Monday, it wouldn't have mattered. And people have been able to -- we have telegraphed what we're doing for the last couple weeks. We took that away, and the President, as you've seen, has been very methodical about making sure we've talked about this for the last week --\nQ: Since the --\nMR. SPICER: Right, but talking about implementing it correctly. And I think Saturday night, if you saw the group of individuals who were down in Florida sitting with him, this is part of that implementation process that we've been talking about, that we were continuing to tweak it, to get it ready to speed, overcome a lot of issues and concerns that had to get added in or out, and make sure that the government was properly -- but make no mistake, we lost the element of surprise back when we said -- when the court enjoined this in the 9th circuit, and then we had to go back to the drawing board and we talked about doing a second order. That was the intent of it the entire time. You lose that back then.\nZeke.\nQ: Going back to the previous topic, the President calling for Congress to investigate these specific issues. Does that mean that the President is willing -- or is committing now to accepting the conclusions of these congressional investigations no matter what they say on anything? So because he's now calling for this investigation, he is now committing to accept the outcome?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't think you would ever just blanketly say \"I'm going to accept any outcome.\" That doesn't matter what it is. You can go to court and -- it doesn't mean that you get found guilty or innocent that you're accepting the outcome, it means that you're agreeing that that's a legitimate -- but I think we're going to let Congress work its will. I think if we have a problem with one of the conclusions, we'll let it be known.\nBut I think that, for right now, the issue is, is that we think that that's the appropriate place for this to be looked into. And they have the resources, and they, themselves, have admitted that.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, can I ask two topics?\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: On this topic, let me just follow up. If members of Congress pursue an investigation that looks into surveillance in the way the President would like them to, and he believes that that surveillance is potentially against the law, they would make recommendations to the executive branch to pursue and prosecute anyone responsible for that. So their recommendations would come back to the Justice Department. So to ask the question again, would the President accept the recommendations of the legislative branch that potentially laws were broken and that those accusations should come back to the Justice Department to investigate?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's hard to prejudge what they're doing. Obviously, the reason that he's asking the House and Senate Intelligence Committee to go through this is because he thinks that they are the appropriate venues. They have the appropriate staff to look at them, and I think it's an appropriate way of having that separation of powers, if you will, where it's not asking -- directing the Department of Justice to do something that they may or may not be the ones conducting.\nBut again, the reason I don't want to give a blanket statement, Alexis, isn't because I'm trying to prejudge it. But I think that depending on a lot of things, you don't want to say, we're going to accept every single thing they do. I think we definitely will have a lot of respect for what they do and what they look into, but I think to blanketly accept -- just say, we're going to accept anything they say or do, might be a bit premature and not exactly the way to go.\nQ: And I had a healthcare question but before I do that, it was reported that the President was interested in having the White House Counsel pursue information that would help support the President's argument that he may have been under surveillance. Is it the case that the President has indeed asked Don McGhan to continue doing that? Or is he dropping that and --\nMR. SPICER: No, Don McGhan was never asked -- all Don Mcghan was ever asked to do was to review what options, if any, were available. That's it. Just review internally and tell the President, this is what's -- but we made very clear to anyone who asked -- and if you know Don and the team here -- these are unbelievably talented lawyers. They're very skilled in understanding their -- where the bounds are, and would understand that any type of interference would be -- it was an internal review of what options, if any, were available. So it's full stop.\nQ: And that was completed?\nMR. SPICER: That guidance was made available to the President.\nQ: Okay. Here's my healthcare question.\nMR. SPICER: It was also reported that the President's desire for speed with the administration's own Affordable Care Act replacement plan has kicked the ball to the OMB Director rather the HHS Secretary to complete that work and get it out this week. Who is in charge of actually completing that? Is it more now in the ball court of OMB rather than HHS? Or are they working together? How would you describe it, and is it still coming out this week?\nMR. SPICER: I believe it is coming out -- I have every intention that it comes out this week. But I think it's a joint effort. I think Secretary Price is obviously the lead; it's HHS. But Director Mulvaney, his time -- I mean, they've both served in the House and were champions of budget issues. Obviously, there's a huge budgetary impact on that, and his understanding of the budget, his role here, and, obviously, his understanding of Congress makes Director Mulvaney a great partner.\nSo it's not a question of -- and this is the same issue that came up during the transition on trade. I think we have an unbelievably talented team -- everybody from Robert Lighthizer, when he gets confirmed as the U.S. Trade Rep, you've got Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Peter Navarro here -- it's not an either/or thing. It's I think bringing the best and the brightest together to get something through.\nObamacare and repealing and replacing it with something that's more accessible, affordable, more innovative is not something that just has to land in one person's hand. It can be covered -- and I think there are great partners and great teammates.\nYes.\nQ: Yes, please, thank you, Sean. I'm just wondering when you said that it's pretty clear that there was some sort of intelligence or wiretaps and that that's why we need to move forward with an investigation, is that based on people speaking on the record, or anonymous sources?\nMR. SPICER: On the record. I think General Mukasey was very much on the record when he came to that conclusion. I think that when you -- anyway. I will leave it to Congress to further follow up on that.\nQ: And one more, if I may. The President has yet to announce the vast majority of his sub-Cabinet-level nominations, such as Ambassador to Japan. Does the White House have a long-term timeline for all the rest of these nominations?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I think that you should -- there's a bunch of sub-Cabinet individuals and ambassadorships that should be coming out very soon. One of the things that I think -- I'm glad you kind of gave me an opportunity to touch on personnel. There was a report the other day that of, like, the 1,927 positions that -- someone went through, I think one of the things that people have to recognize is -- we talked about this a lot during the transition. We had about 600 members of these beachhead teams that went in under a special hiring process -- that they're able to be there for 120 days. For the most part, most of those people transition into Schedule C positions. It's not a given. It is not a default, meaning -- and I think we made it clear during the transition -- it's not just if you showed up for the first 120 days you get to stay. But sort of -- they were chosen specifically because of their understanding of the issue, their expertise or their desire to serve in that particular capacity.\nAnd so we actually -- when you actually look at the numbers, we are well ahead, if not on par with -- we're well ahead of almost every modern administration. I think we're right on par with Obama '08. But you think about it, of the 1,927 or so positions, we've got over 600 of those individuals, and -- most of whom so far are looking like they're fully going to convert to Schedule C. But they are performing the duties that would be done by a Schedule C.\nSo when you look at the totality of what we're doing, we were well ahead on the Cabinet. And again, one of the other things is, you've got Congress still holding up the Cabinet getting appointed. And so I think there's a degree to which Senate Democrats, before we get a lot of stones thrown at us about where we are on the rest, they haven't even finished the job at hand of getting the full Cabinet.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. Two questions on the executive order. With the first executive order, there was a lot of fanfare when the President signed that executive order; in the Oval Office today, not so much. We didn't see the President, no cameras, no pool. Why didn't he want to show us him signing this new executive order?\nMR. SPICER: I tweeted a picture out.\nQ: That's your picture, that's not independent --\nQ: Well, I know -- from today. Yeah, that's your --\nMR. SPICER: I know, I'm -- I think -- (laughter) -- there are three agencies that are dealing with -- to your point, we went through this. We talked about the courts issue, we talked about this ad nauseam; the President got asked about it over and over again. I think today was about the implementation of it, was about having the three Departments that are expressly named to implement this to talk about what they're doing to implement it. And I think they did a phenomenal job about it.\nAnd that's what we wanted to highlight today, is the government getting it done. And the way that the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State were implementing the measures that the President laid forth -- again, if you think about it, the principles of the executive order remain the same. We looked at what the court said, we put together a thing -- we consulted with the relevant agencies and Departments. We talked to Congress. We had an extensive morning of briefings. The call to the press lasted about an hour, I guess.\nAnd so we made sure that everybody knew what we were doing. We sent them out to make sure that the American people could see what they were doing.\nAnd so I just want to be clear that I think we did a phenomenal job of rolling it out and making sure the American people saw the faces of the Departments that were instrumental in implementing it.\nI'm sorry, Jon, go ahead.\nQ: That's all right. The second one has to do with this idea of \"element of surprise.\" With the first executive order and also with this one, there's a 90-day temporary ban on residents entering this country from six predominantly Muslim countries. What's to stop a so-called \"bad dude\" from one of these countries from coming into the country on the 91st day, or the 92nd day? Why 90 days? Doesn't that get rid of that element of surprise when you say --\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that -- no, but -- thank you, that's actually an interesting question. I think part of it is, is that we feel confident that during that 90-day period, the processes could be put in place.\nNow, remember, there's two key things that are important. Number one is these six countries are the ones that we don't have the information currently that we feel comfortable -- and as I lifted off why -- I mean, there are some that literally are state-sponsors of terror. And I think when you recognize -- I don't think there's any American that wants a country that is a state-sponsor of terror to be sending their individuals here without us properly vetting them.\nYou talk about Yemen, the documents that people use in Yemen are not accepted by a whole host of countries because they lack the integrity to ensure that they are not compromised. And I think that there is a big difference in that, but we can -- at the end of that 90-day period, we can let a country off, we can expand the list of countries, we could indefinitely address the countries that are on the list, we could expand that list to other countries that aren't on it.\nBut there's two things that are happening. One is, we're putting a ban on those countries, the six that are named. But two is, we're looking at an entire -- at the rest of the entire world, and all of the procedures that we use to address all countries.\nAnd so at the end of that period, we could add countries. We could subtract countries. We could decide to indefinitely continue with one of the two -- one of the six, rather. But if you look at the case of Iraq, after the first order, they stepped up with four very specific things that they did to ensure that people traveling from Iraq, we had certain things -- whether it be biometrics and others -- that let us ensure that people coming into the country, we felt confident in knowing that they were coming in.\nBut that's an important thing. It's not just those six. We're looking at that time -- we're dealing with those during that 90-day -- but we're also looking at everybody else at the same period.\nKaitlan.\nQ: So why doesn't the order prevent people who didn't have visas by the day of the first order from coming in the country? Because wouldn't that safeguard from the people who went and got visas during this revision period?\nMR. SPICER: I would just say I think that there's appropriate steps that have been taken during that period to ensure that the homeland has been protected.\nGo ahead, I know you have another one.\nQ: Just one more question.\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: Does the President think that Barack Obama himself wiretapped him, or someone in the administration?\nMR. SPICER: I'm just going to say that as the President noted in his statement, we're going to let Congress look into that and then we'll get back to you -- we'll discuss it after Congress comes with -- Erin.\nQ: Since the President contends that he and President Obama like each other, has he picked up the phone and called President Obama since the inauguration, or did he think about asking him directly before accusing him publicly?\nMR. SPICER: I have not -- I'm not aware of whether or not they've talked. I can ask and find out and get back to you.\nCecilia.\nQ: Does the fact that you're rescinding this first executive order -- is it at all an admission that things just didn't go right the first time around?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think the first executive order, we've made clear time and time again -- when you look at how the court adjudicated that, their facts were wrong. Just in terms of how many people had come into the country, they based it off of several things that I think were not factually accurate. I think we recognized that we could have been in litigation for up to a year on this, and that would have left the country exposed.\nAnd I think that that's -- there is a goal here that we sought to achieve the first time that we have to maintain. But by no means -- we 100 percent maintain that the executive order as initially drafted is completely constitutional and legal, and that what we've done is to do the best of our ability based on what the court --\nQ: Sean --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, it's still Cecilia's turn.\nQ: Thank you. What about this issue of radicalization after people are here, which is what DHS raised in that report? One of the examples that's cited in the EO today is the Somali man, now, who came as a child and was radicalized here. So what does this order do about that population of people?\nMR. SPICER: The people that are here --\nQ: That are here, which is what -- the concern that DHS raised in this report, that said people -- the bigger concern is people who are here and are radicalized after the fact, not those that are here just stopping to --\nMR. SPICER: I think that what we need to do -- this isn't a one-stop shop. I think that we have to look at this -- the entire problem. This is one piece of the problem that we're looking at to make sure that we keep the country safe. It's not a either/or, or only-this-then. But I think you're going to see a continuation of steps that the President takes to make sure that the country is protected.\nOne small correction that I've been made aware of, it's Somalia, not Yemen, that the travel docs are not accepted. So my apologies to Yemen.\nJeff, did you -- hold on. Thanks. Jeff.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. You've mentioned a couple times and referred a couple times today to DNI Clapper -- former DNI Clapper's comments on -- over the weekend about Russia and the Trump campaign. Are you encouraging people to take those comments seriously but not the comments where he said there was no wiretapping?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm just -- well, first of all, he also said that he wasn't aware -- he couldn't speak entirely when it came to wiretapping. He said that he wasn't aware of anything. I take him at his word that he wasn't aware, but that doesn't mean that it didn't exist.\nBut I also think that it's interesting that the double standard that has existed for so long when it comes to -- you have these sources over and over again who have been briefed by the FBI that say, I was briefed, there's nothing there. You have Clapper saying, \"Not that I'm aware of.\" And yet, we still have these stories over and over again citing anonymous sources.\nAt some point, you have to question how many times are you going to take \"didn't see anything there\" before we start seeing these stories getting rewritten over and over and over again? I think that is a valid question. It's interesting how everyone today is asking what sources we have, and yet we've been asking the same question about the sources for these anonymous sources and story after story for the last six months. And it's just, don't worry, we have these trusted anonymous sources that may or may not be true. And at the bottom of every story it has some kind of caveat that -- however there has been no formal evidence presented.\nI think there's been a malignment for so many months about what may or may not have happened, and yet not a shred of single truth has actually come that shows any evidence that existed except for anonymous source after anonymous source after anonymous source.\nQ: On a different issue?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: What is the White House's reaction to North Korea firing four ballistic missiles into the sea off of Japan's northwest?\nMR. SPICER: The launches are consistent with North Korea's long history of provocative behavior. The United States stands with our allies in the face of this very serious threat. The Trump administration is taking steps to enhance our ability to defend against North Korea's ballistic missiles, such as through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Africa -- South Korea.\nQ: I just want to circle back around to a couple things that you said. You said it could be FISA, it could be surveillance. So are you saying that the administration is conceding that somewhere there was evidence presented before a judge that shows there could be collusion with the campaign and that it was okay to surveil them?\nMR. SPICER: No, what I'm suggesting is that, as I said, that our goal is to allow Congress to do its job, as the statement said yesterday.\nOlivier.\nQ: And then the follow-up on the new order. You had said that there are a hundred or so that had been inspected, but how many total that came in that you all have detained.\nMR. SPICER: It's 300.\nQ: Of 300 -- 100 refugees? You said hundreds of -- or 300 refugees. How many total came in, and how many did you detain?\nMR. SPICER: I'd ask you to talk to the Department of Justice -- actually, Homeland Security on that one. I know the top-line stat on that one.\nOlivier.\nQ: A couple for you. One, just scheduling. The Israeli defense minister is in town tomorrow. Will he meet with the President?\nMR. SPICER: I'll have to get back to you on that. I'm not aware that that's on the schedule at this time, but -- I don't know. I know that he and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke earlier. I'm not aware that that came up.\nQ: And can you flesh out this notion of 300 refugees being investigated? What are they being investigated for, specifically? What's the source for this information --\nMR. SPICER: The FBI.\nQ: So the FBI is investigating 300 refugees currently on U.S. soil on terrorism-related charges?\nMR. SPICER: That's what I have been -- yes. I'll get you the stat for that, but that's --\nQ: That would be great. Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: Anita.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about Iraq and how they're not -- why they're not in the executive order anymore? So is this a signal to the other six and to other countries that they can also get removed if they -- I think you called it \"proactive,\" if they were proactively having their own actions?\nMR. SPICER: I think what I would say, and I think the way you phrased it is right. It's not just the six countries, it's countries throughout the globe. I think that we are -- it is in every country's best interest to know who's coming in and out of its country and to do things. And I think there are things that we've asked countries to do. And it's not inclusive, it's not \"have you hit these four.\" I think each country is a separate case. So I don't want to say, \"if you do these four you're in.\"\nQ: But is it possible, then, to --\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. I think there is -- now, in some cases, like anything else, Anita, it may be easier for one country to achieve something than for another. But at the end of the day, I think there are certain things that -- there are certain steps that Iraq went through, including things like biometrics and turning over lists of -- updating lists, rather, of people within their country that have -- that pose a threat.\nAnd so that -- they've agreed to do certain things after the first one was ordered that give us a much greater degree of confidence in knowing who is coming in and out of the country.\nQ: And then on another topic. What was the President's reaction to hearing about Vice President Pence's email use, personal email for government business? I ask, obviously, because he had so many things to say about Hillary Clinton using personal email for government business last year?\nMR. SPICER: I was going to insert, like, an AOL joke here. (Laughter.)\nBut I think, look, I don't -- I think there's a big difference. The Vice President complied with Indiana law, turned over all of his emails and made sure that everything was done. I mean, that's a very big step. There's no question that I've been made aware of that he didn't do everything in compliance with Indiana law. There's a big difference between doing what is common practice within a state government and what is in compliance with that state's laws, then setting up a private server that seeks specifically to go around the government protocols and the Federal Records Act.\nThere's a big difference between that. But I mean, the governor at the time, and now the Vice President, did everything in compliance with Indiana law. And I think that's a big difference, is that it's not a question of -- it's a question of was there a law and was there a rule and did you follow it. In the case of Governor Pence, he did. In the case of Secretary Clinton, I would let the record speak for itself on that.\nSara. Gabby, I'm sorry.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Part of the justification for the hurried rollout of the initial executive order on immigration was that if it wasn't rolled out immediately, that people would take advantage of that and come into the country. So why has the administration decided to delay the implementation of this new executive order until March 16th?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you Hallie Jackson. (Laughter.) That was what Hallie asked earlier.\nQ: Sorry.\nMR. SPICER: No problem, it's in the -- but basically the answer that I gave Hallie that I'll give to you is, I think the first order -- one of the goals of the first order was an element of surprise, to implement it in a way that didn't allow people to get in, right?\nSince the 9th Circuit acted, we've been talking about a second executive order. I think we lost the element of surprise back in mid- to early February when the 9th Circuit acted the way they did. So that element -- what we've tried to do now is to make sure, with that element gone, that we've implemented this in a way that ensures the greatest degree of confidence that we know what we're doing.\nOne quick item -- I'm not done, so don't -- you can keep your hands -- someone asked earlier, and I'm trying to remember who, about the source for DOJ. Was that you, Olivier? The Department of Justice, FBI investigation, section one, subsection H, the text of the EO notes -- you can check on that for the source.\nI'm sorry. Matt.\nQ: Thanks. Sean, doubling back to something we talked about earlier. President Trump accused President Obama of criminal conduct. One, can you tell us what his source was for that accusation? Two, can you tell us, unequivocally, that he was basing that on more than a talk radio report and a Breitbart article about that talk radio report?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to tell that -- I've said it over and over again, I think the President made it very clear in the statement yesterday that he is not going to comment any further on this until Congress does --\nQ: So maybe it was just based on the talk radio report?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I'm just going to say that the President made it very clear that, based on numerous things, including -- and I think there's a New York Times story on it, there's several sources that made this clear or brought this to light -- but I'm not going to go into anything further, as the President noted, until this is resolved.\nMara.\nQ: I have two topics. One, on the EO that maybe is coming later this week -- an EO on the Obama administration's fuel-economy standards. Are you going to have an EO reversing those, and will that also negate California's waiver?\nMR. SPICER: I don't see anything on -- I'll have to get back to you, as my standard. I'm not so sure on the timing -- I was just looking at my date.\nQ: Oh, okay. Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: But I'd just -- I wouldn't get -- I don't have anything to announce at the time, is generally how I answer that, and I'm going to stick to it.\nQ: Okay, but I have just one more question on the other topic. You said that you pointed rightly to Clapper's comments -- nothing that he knows of suggests there was any collusion between the campaign and Russia. But he also said that he didn't know of any wiretap FISA order. Why are you willing to accept his --\nMR. SPICER: That's what Jeff asked.\nQ: Well, I guess the thing I'm asking is that the President of the United States has unilateral authority to declassify anything that he wants. He said in his tweet, I just learned of this. So he obviously had some kind of evidence. Why not declassify it?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's -- as I have made clear, there's a reason that we want Congress, the intelligence committees to do their job in terms of making sure that there's a separation of powers.\nQ: He's afraid it would look like interference?\nMR. SPICER: I think that, again, I'm just going to leave it at that he thinks it's appropriate for Congress to do this instead of trying to point to his own Department of Justice.\nAshley.\nQ: Sean --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, you're going to wait your turn. It's Ashley's turn.\nQ: Thank you. This morning, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News and she said, \"He's the President of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.\" So that seemed to be referring not to these news reports you're talking about, but to specific, tangible evidence. So what can you tell us about what that evidence is, where it came from? And then secondly, if he has this evidence, why is he asking Congress to investigate?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I just -- I think the point that Kellyanne was making at the time is that the President, because he's President, gets access to NSC and other intelligence documents. I don't know -- I haven't seen the exact transcript, so I can't --\nQ: I can read it to you.\nMR. SPICER: I appreciate that, thank you. But I also haven't talked to Kellyanne about it, so I don't think you can do that part. But I don't -- so I can't specifically respond to you in terms of what she was referring to, whether she was referring to the exact nature of his charge or whether, generally speaking, he is given information.\nBut again, on all of this, I'm going to go back to the statement earlier that the President's goal right now is to make sure that House and Senate can do this -- yes.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. China is retaliating against the THAAD deployment in South Korea. What is the U.S. position?\nMR. SPICER: It's retaliating against what?\nQ: Against the THAAD deployment in South Korea, THAAD battery deployment.\nMR. SPICER: The THAAD battery?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I think we're going to work with South Korea. I mean, obviously, North Korea's missile launches present a danger to our friends down south. And I think, as I mentioned in our response, we're going to continue to work with the government of South Korea to address this thing.\nQ: Would the U.S. -- the Chinese government?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not at this point -- huh?\nQ: -- the Chinese government?\nMR. SPICER: We have not had any further conversations on this. I think this is consistent with U.S. policy.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, two points of clarification. Did the President mean in any way to suggest that the FBI broke the law, or any other intelligence agencies, with this allegation of wiretapping?\nMR. SPICER: In the tweet?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: I'm just going to let the tweet speak for itself. I'm not going to get into --\nQ: Well, that's why I'm asking this question?\nMR. SPICER: I get it, but I think that I'm not going to try to --\nQ: Because it opens that up.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think I will seek further clarification on that. For right now, I would just suggest to you that I'm going to let it speak until I can get further clarification.\nQ: My second point of clarification here. You said, you know, you didn't want to really get into what the triggering event was for the tweet in the first place, but I want you to address this part if you would. The question has been raised -- or the allegation has been raised that the President was simply trying to change the topic off of an unfortunate news cycle that week. Can you address that portion of the question, that this was deliberately about changing the media narrative and not anything having to do with the story itself?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't -- I mean, that's -- I have nothing to lead me to believe that that was the case. I'm not sure -- and I think he had a great week last week. He had a phenomenal joint address. We had a great visit down in Norfolk, talked about rebuilding the military. He was in Orlando, in Florida, talking about how school choice can help children and parents and create better schools.\nSo I just -- I can't say that I've talked to him specifically about this, but I think the President had a good week. And so I don't see any reason that he would be using -- I mean, that just -- I think it was an issue of concern to him.\nQ: Sean, let's remind everybody what the President did tweet Saturday morning: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory.\" He later called Obama a stupid guy -- or whatever it was exactly -- a sick guy. Yeah, sorry. Are the American people supposed to pull back and suddenly think that this is not the President of the United States accusing his predecessor of committing a crime when he writes it that way?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think the President speaks very candidly. His tweets speak for themselves, as we've said before, and he's asked the House and Senate committees to look into this.\nSara.\nQ: Considering the scrutiny surrounding President Trump's then-campaign advisors and Russia, which has carried over at the White House, is he reconsidering at all his hope or his timeline for pairing with Russia to fight ISIS?\nMR. SPICER: Is he -- based on --\nQ: Just based on the amount of scrutiny surrounding his --\nMR. SPICER: No, I mean, I think if Russia wants to join with us to fight ISIS, that's a great --\nQ: So nothing has changed on that front?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And secondly, in light of the fact that there were previously undisclosed communications between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, has White House counsel done anything proactively to try to go to senior staffers or other Cabinet-level officials and say, hey, if you have had contact with a Russian official that you have not previously disclosed, then now is the time to do it?\nMR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of. I'm not aware of any of that. I would say that there's -- one of the things that is interesting that, you know -- in the course of people conducting their business here at the White House or during a transition or in the House or the Senate, you contact a whole host of people -- diplomats, government officials, you know, association representatives, corporate representatives. I mean, that's -- those are the kind of folks that talk to people in government.\nAnd I think that there's one thing between talking with somebody -- I mean, I think -- and again, I'll get back to you so don't be prescriptive on this. I think someone had told me earlier today that there were something like 20 visits to the Russian ambassador in the last, you know, 10, maybe, years. I don't -- huh?\nQ: Twenty-two.\nMR. SPICER: Twenty-two. Thank you for helping fact check me. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- is not here, so somebody's got to do it. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. Where's Knoller? But I think at some point, there's nothing wrong with people doing their job, right? I mean, that's what I think that there is a big difference between so-and-so met with someone. There's nothing to disclose with a meeting. If I have a meeting with a member of the media, no one says, hey, did you know that you need to report every time you meet with this individual or this outlet or whatever. There's nowhere to report that kind of stuff. There's a big difference between doing something nefarious or illegal and conducting yourself in a routine course of business.\nQ: But there were clearly a number of instances where people in this administration suggested they did not have any contact or misled you guys about the amount of contact they had, which has then caused some unflattering news cycles.\nMR. SPICER: Well, and I think -- so in one case, Michael Flynn was, you know -- the President said the inconsistencies and him not being straight with the Vice President -- he asked him to resign. I think the President dealt with it.\nBut that was -- again, if you note the President's comments at the time, he was very clear that the issue wasn't that he's doing his job. The issue was him misleading the Vice President. And that's a very different thing.\nSo he had no problem with him doing his job and contacting individuals that we were going to need to be in contact with during the administration. And that's where I think there is a big difference between a lot of these stories saying, did you know that so and so did this? There's nothing wrong with people meeting with ambassadors, or government officials, or corporate representatives, or members of the media. That's part of what we do in government.\nAnd so I think there's a big difference in the question that you're asking about whether or not someone is doing something that's wrong and inappropriate or illegal, and someone doing what they would do in a normal course of business.\nQ: Well, I think the other question is just whether there have been more instances in this that are going to catch you guys by surprise since he --\nMR. SPICER: And I guess --\nQ: -- the President himself has denied that there was any kind of this contact throughout the campaign, and then we found out there were national security --\nMR. SPICER: But hold on. Actually --\nQ: -- advisors you didn't mention meeting with the Russian ambassador as well as Jeff Sessions, and then there was this meeting with Michael Flynn, as well as Jared Kushner, which was not previously disclosed.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, so there's two things. You said the President found out about this. What's \"this?\" Having a meeting? Again, I don't think that -- there's countless meetings that members of his senior staff and the rest of people throughout government have on it every day. That's why he's asked us to come here and work, is to facilitate some of these meetings and get some of this stuff done.\nThere is no one to disclose stuff to. I don't disclose the --\nQ: That sounds like you're saying you're not concerned that they're --\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not that I'm not concerned. I guess there's -- but what I'm getting at, Sara, is that there's a difference between being concerned about somebody -- I could equally be concerned that if a member of the media said, hey, I want to take a member of your staff out, and we're going to break some kind of ethics rule. I would be concerned about that. But I wouldn't be concerned if they said, hey, we want to go have coffee with a member of the media.\nThey don't disclose all that on our staff. And I think -- but that's essential to your question is, is a meeting -- there's nothing wrong with a meeting. There's nothing wrong with meeting with a government official, or a diplomat, or a member of the media, or a corporate individual, or association, or a constituent, or a citizen that has an issue. But on any of those categories, once they cross the line and do something wrong, and I think to the answer of your question, the issue was specifically -- or the question surrounded attempts to influence the election. Those are very different than people meeting also during a transition period, or people meeting in their White House capacity. But those are three separate instances.\nAll of the stories that I've heard so far, previously all detailed just action with respect to the campaign and Russia's attempt to influence the campaign, right?\nQ: Yes, I mean, I think --\nMR. SPICER: Yes, I mean that's --\nQ: That was the backdrop.\nMR. SPICER: Right. That's the backdrop. And then -- and so I think in the one instance where it happened where there was someone that misled someone, they were let go.\nSo for you to start asking questions about, well, what if these other individuals had a meeting? Well, were they ever asked about it? I mean there's a big difference between did someone meet with someone; and did someone mislead somebody about meeting someone. And that is a very, very big difference in those questions.\nAnd that's one of the things that I think is important to distinguish. People can meet with people. The question is did they do something wrong. Did they mislead somebody? And those are all very, very different categories.\nApril.\nQ: Okay, Sean, I have a couple of topics. And back on this following up, so the question is: Under what capacity was he in when he met with the ambassador? And what did they talk about?\nMR. SPICER: Who is he?\nQ: Sessions.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know.\nQ: And then under -- then when he was under oath, he said he didn't do it. But then we find out later, so what do you say --\nMR. SPICER: No, no. Well, first of all, I'm not going to -- I'll refer you back to the Department of Justice. I know -- my understanding is he's amending his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee from what I've heard. So I'll let his people -- but I do think that his explanation that he gave was very -- was that he was answering a question did you have any meetings with anyone with respect to the campaign.\nAnd I think in his mind, it was very clear that, I never met with anybody with respect to the campaign. I met with someone in my Senate office, in my capacity as a United States senator, with Senate staff to discuss foreign policy or whatever it was that he was discussing.\nI think the Senator discussed this in his media conference last week Thursday. So I don't -- I guess the issue is with respect to what was talked about, I don't know. That's up to him.\nBut I do think the way he described it was very clear that he believed he was answering Senator Franken's question with respect to activity involving the campaign and attempts to -- as I said to Sara, like this whole idea of influencing the election. Meeting with an ambassador about an area of foreign policy in his Senate office with his Senate staff was clearly not a campaign event.\nQ: Okay, so now on the leak issue. You're talking about Congress doing an investigation. But some of these leaks are coming from top officials, people who know insider information. What has the President said to his staff as it relates to the leaks in reference to trying to find out himself, not just from top-level people, what has he said to people about the leaks, about trying to stop it, or trying to find out what's happening?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President made clear in his comments when he stood before you all a couple weeks ago that his main concern is national security. That's -- when he keeps talking about the leaks, his concern is the leaks that damage and undermine national security, the leaks that deal with classified and other information. That's what his main concern is. And I don't think -- that's not a White House issue. That's sort of -- that is an issue that is beyond the White House. We're not --\nQ: Other leaks don't matter, but the national --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I think -- it's not that other leaks don't matter. I think his issue that he has talked about and his concern is the leaks of national security. It's not that he's saying, other leaks are okay.\nBut I think the ones that threaten our public safety or potentially put our country in harm are the ones that he really cares about.\nPeter.\nQ: I have a question. I'm sorry. This President reached out to former President Obama several times when he was President.\nMR. SPICER: That's right.\nQ: They started building something. There was a bridge. Now some people in the Obama camp are considering these conversations about, or these tweets crazy. And the question is now: With this divide between these two, and President Trump may need to one day reach back to former President Obama, how do you think that will play out? Do you think that these two will never come back together again? Is this something he could have talked to him about before he went on Twitter? There is now a chasm. There's a divide that wasn't there a couple of weeks ago.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, well, there was a divide during the campaign, too. I don't think that -- I think that, as you saw, and the President has made it very clear, he said some things about the President. And the President said stuff -- about the campaign. I think they came together for the good of the country. And in cases where they can come together for a common good and to talk about what's in the country's best interests, they will.\nBut I understand your point. I just think the President --\nQ: Did he burn a bridge?\nQ: Hold up, hold on.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. But I think that they'll be just fine. So go ahead. That's you.\nQ: Oh, good.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Hi, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: Hi, Julie. You've been very patient.\nQ: Yes, I have. Thanks.\nMR. SPICER: I think it's your first time.\nQ: It is, yes.\nMR. SPICER: Well, welcome. See how pleasant this is?\nQ: I was feeling like how can I not get called on my first time? Ten years ago, Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran. And I know the President talked about this a little bit on the campaign trail. Is there anything you can tell us about how the administration is approaching this case? Have they been in communication with his family or any updates on that?\nMR. SPICER: I think we put out a statement from the NSC on Friday on this -- Victoria. I think we -- so we have been in communication with his family. I believe they were here -- or we were in touch with them last week. And obviously, we continue to hold out hope. But the administration has been in touch with his family.\nQ: Sean, the call to Netanyahu, what prompted that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know, Dave. I'll find out. I just know it happened. And I got a little bit of a --\nQ: As you might know, the Prime Minister is meeting later this week with Vladimir Putin. Did the President and the Prime Minister talk about Syria at all?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I know that they had a discussion about regional threats, so I don't want to get ahead of this.\nDavid Jackson.\nQ: Comey did tell people this weekend that President Obama did not order these wiretaps, and he did want the Justice Department to put out that statement. Does President Obama believe --\nMR. SPICER: Are you -- like I said, I am not -- wait, so --\nQ: Does President Trump believe Comey when he says that President Obama did not authorize these wiretaps?\nMR. SPICER: My question is, is that I don't think that we've confirmed that Director Comey did say that. I don't -- I'm not aware. Aside from reading stories that cite anonymous sources saying that he did, I'm not aware that that actually happened. So that's the first issue that I think we need to resolve.\nQ: Well, people we trust did tell us that he did.\nMR. SPICER: Well, with all due respect, not you, but I think that we've had a number of reports that I've seen that -- about things that have occurred in the last 40-some-odd days that actually didn't occur, but anonymous sources said they did.\nPeter Alexander.\nQ: Sean, to be clear, you said earlier as an on-the-record source for the President's wiretapping claims, he referred to the former Attorney General Michael Mukasey. I just want to ask you to clarify if you could because his public comments were on Sunday, a day after the President tweeted about this. And even in his public comments, he said that he based his information \"on news reports.\"\nMR. SPICER: Okay. But I'm just saying that he is -- someone asked whether it was an on-the-record comment. And that is on the record.\nQ: But I was saying, was there an on -- you were being asked was there an on-the-record comment in advance of the President's tweets to which he was basing his information? Did he have anything better than anonymous sources?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'm not -- as I said before, I'm not going to get into the elements of that. I'll just -- I'm going to wait until the House and Senate.\nQ: Really, just on a past comment that the President had made about the suggestion that there were -- or the claim, in fact, that there were 3 million to 5 million people who voted illegally in this country -- he made this claim more than a month ago. I just want to get a sense now on the update on any investigation into that and where it stands, given the explosive nature of such a claim.\nMR. SPICER: I think we've touched on this, but he has asked Vice President Pence to lead a task force on this. We have -- I'll get more for you. I know that there's been some discussion with some Secretaries of State and others on some of this. I know you had that issue in Texas come -- last week, and I'm trying to remember the exact nature of it, but there has been now further evidence that people have voted illegally. And I think that one of the things the task force is looking to do is to gather additional information of what -- it's still in the process of getting the task members named.\nQ: Does the task force, I guess, exist yet? Or is --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, the Vice President has been talking to folks potentially to serve on it, and I know that several Secretaries of State have expressed --\nQ: It hasn't convened yet, but he's been talking to folks about it.\nMR. SPICER: That's correct. That's correct.\nQ: Sean, two subjects here, following up on the wiretap question. Stepping away from what the President knew or the basis of his tweets, how appropriate is it for a President to make an explosive charge as fact and then send you folks out to step away and say this maybe happened and we should investigate it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think there's two things. One is the President's tweets speak for themselves. We're making that very --\nQ: But --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. And I think the President has been very clear, as we've stated, that I think there's enough there that we want the House and Senate intelligence to use the resources they do to make sure that they look into this matter. I mean, that's -- there is -- anyway, I do not want to get ahead of where they may go with this or what they may look at, but I'm going to leave it to them. If we start down the rabbit hole of discussing some of this stuff I think then we end up in a very difficult place.\nI look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow. If you can bring your cameras --\nQ: Sean, housekeeping-wise, you said that we'd get some clarification on a number of questions -- to all of us. If you could do that today through the pool --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I think we can try to do that through the pool. If not, we'll write everything -- we generally write down everything and try to get back to the reporters. So I will have the team -- and then get it out by the pool.\nQ: Will we be hearing from the President this week, since we didn't today?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure at some point we'll do either something that we -- a photo spray or something. I think that we have a pretty good track record of making the President available to folks.\nQ: -- kind of unusual.\nMR. SPICER: What's unusual?\nQ: To not --\nMR. SPICER: It's Monday.\nQ: Exactly.\nQ: But you see -- everything is closed. Normally we have a photo spray or something.\nMR. SPICER: I just -- I think that's -- don't give me this \"normally we do.\" I made it very clear at the beginning of this, April, that we have some things on camera, some off. Last week the President traveled two days, he had the joint session. We briefed every single day --\nQ: It's not about us, it's about the American public seeing their President. And we have to --\nMR. SPICER: Wait, hold on. Seeing their President. The guy is in meetings all day. I'm trying -- how many times did you complain about the President --\nQ: He signed executive orders. You had us -- last week you said --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. He signed an executive order. I mean, this is a President, when it comes to accessibility and allowing the press access, I think I've heard from several of you -- we have gone above and beyond allowing the press into events, into sprays. We've had greater access.\nSo, with all due respect, I mean that's not been the case. One day out of the last 41 or 40, whatever it's been -- but I think this President has been extremely accessible, extremely transparent, as far as -- he signed an executive order this morning that we then put all three Cabinet Secretaries that were relevant to implement this out.\nI'll be out tomorrow. I think we have an opportunity -- look, I made it very clear from the beginning of this that we'd have a briefing every day. We've gaggled every day, we've made ourselves available to you. So, with all due respect, that's not a very accurate assessment of how we've been acting.\nThanks. I'll see you guys tomorrow.\nEND 2:50 P.M.

As an increasing number of transactions and activities occur online, the safety of vital consumer information is increasingly at risk. The American people deserve freedom from unscrupulous actors who perpetrate identity theft, abuse personal information, or engage in fraud.\nCyber crimes, which defraud hard-working Americans, cost our families billions of dollars each year and result in tremendous stress, loss of time, and hardship. Americans must have access to the tools necessary to protect their personal information and privacy and know how to use them to improve their online security. Our first defense against fraudulent cyber transactions and the misuse of personal information will always be a well-informed consumer.\nNational Consumer Protection Week reminds us of the importance of empowering consumers by helping them to more capably identify and report cyber scams, monitor their online privacy and security, and make well-informed decisions. The Federal Government, in conjunction with a network of national organizations and State and local partners, provides consumer education resources to help Americans protect their personal information. These resources assist military service members and their families, identity-theft victims, and all potentially vulnerable consumers. Our work to protect consumers from identity theft, abuse of personal information, and fraud, and to improve the integrity and security of our marketplaces, enhances the prosperity of our great country.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 5 through March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates to educate our citizens about the protection of personal information and identity theft through consumer education activities in communities across the country.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on March 9.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123450", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.\n(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).\n(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: \"(I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.\" 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.\n(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\" 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries—each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States—would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.\n(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.\n(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities—whoever they are and wherever they reside—to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.\n(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the \"political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions\" about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.\n(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.\n(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:\n(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts. (ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.\n(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.\n(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.\n(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.\n(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\n(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.\n(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.\n(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.\nSec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence. (c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.\n(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.\n(e) After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.\n(f) At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.\n(g) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.\nSec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension.\n(a) Scope. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:\n(i) are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;\n(ii) did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and\n(iii) do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.\n(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:\n(i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States; (ii) any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;\n(iii) any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;\n(iv) any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;\n(v) any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or\n(vi) any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n(c) Waivers. Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner's delegee, may, in the consular officer's or the CBP official's discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer's satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest. Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged. Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:\n(i) the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;\n(ii) the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;\n(iii) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;\n(iv) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;\n(v) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;\n(vi) the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;\n(vii) the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), 22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of an international organization not designated under the IOIA;\n(viii) the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or\n(ix) the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.\nSec. 4. Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq. An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS. Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.\nSec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.\nSec. 6. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n(b) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.\n(c) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following: the individual's entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.\n(d) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\nSec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.\nSec. 8. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order.

Policy. It is the policy of the United States to keep its citizens safe from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. To avert the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may aid, support, or commit violent, criminal, or terrorist acts, it is critical that the executive branch enhance the screening and vetting protocols and procedures for granting visas, admission to the United States, or other benefits under the INA. For that reason, in the executive order entitled, \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,\" and issued today, I directed the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to conduct a review to \"identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat.\"\nWhile that comprehensive review is ongoing, however, this Nation cannot delay the immediate implementation of additional heightened screening and vetting protocols and procedures for issuing visas to ensure that we strengthen the safety and security of our country.\nMoreover, because it is my constitutional duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" the executive branch is committed to ensuring that all laws related to entry into the United States are enforced rigorously and consistently.\nSec. 2. Enhanced Vetting Protocols and Procedures for Visas and Other Immigration Benefits. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, as permitted by law, implement protocols and procedures as soon as practicable that in their judgment will enhance the screening and vetting of applications for visas and all other immigration benefits, so as to increase the safety and security of the American people. These additional protocols and procedures should focus on:\n(a) preventing the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may aid, support, or commit violent, criminal, or terrorist acts; and\n(b) ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary to rigorously evaluate all grounds of inadmissibility or deportability, or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits. Sec. 3. Enforcement of All Laws for Entry into the United States. I direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of all other relevant executive departments and agencies (as identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security) to rigorously enforce all existing grounds of inadmissibility and to ensure subsequent compliance with related laws after admission. The heads of all relevant executive departments and agencies shall issue new rules, regulations, or guidance (collectively, rules), as appropriate, to enforce laws relating to such grounds of inadmissibility and subsequent compliance. To the extent that the Secretary of Homeland Security issues such new rules, the heads of all other relevant executive departments and agencies shall, as necessary and appropriate, issue new rules that conform to them. Such new rules shall supersede any previous rules to the extent of any conflict.\nSec. 4. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To ensure that the American people have more regular access to information, and to ensure that the executive branch shares information among its departments and agencies, the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, issue regular reports regarding visas and adjustments of immigration status, written in non-technical language for broad public use and understanding. In addition to any other information released by the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security:\n(i) Beginning on April 28, 2017, and by the last day of every month thereafter, the Secretary of State shall publish the following information about actions taken during the preceding calendar month:\n(A) the number of visas that have been issued from each consular office within each country during the reporting period, disaggregated by detailed visa category and country of issuance; and\n(B) any other information the Secretary of State considers appropriate, including information that the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may request be published.\n(ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue reports detailing the number of adjustments of immigration status that have been made during the reporting period, disaggregated by type of adjustment, type and detailed class of admission, and country of nationality. The first report shall be issued within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, and subsequent reports shall be issued every 90 days thereafter. The first report shall address data from the date of this memorandum until the report is issued, and each subsequent report shall address new data since the last report was issued.\n(b) To further ensure transparency for the American people regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of our immigration programs in serving the national interest, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, submit to me a report detailing the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs.\n(c) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, produce a report estimating how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long-term cost as supporting refugees in the United States, taking into account the full lifetime cost of Federal, State, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) All actions taken pursuant to this memorandum shall be consistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods, personally identifiable information, and the confidentiality of visa records. Nothing in this memorandum shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.\n(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(e) The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123500", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:36 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER: Hey, guys. I brought a guest. Good afternoon. First off, at the top, I want to acknowledge that there's been an additional wave of threats to Jewish community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices. According to some reports, there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions since the start of this year alone.\nAs the President said at the beginning of his joint address, \"We're a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms. We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms.\"\nIt is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you, and I share the President's thoughts that he fervently hopes that we don't continue to have to share these reports with you. But as long as they will -- as long as they do continue, we'll continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop them.\nNow, on to news of the day. You saw President Trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises: protecting the country against radical Islamic terrorism, and repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative.\nWe talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the United States yesterday. And so, on to Obamacare. I'd like to introduce the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nDr. Price.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Thanks, Sean. Good afternoon. First, let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I'm the third physician out of 23 individuals who've had the privilege of serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And we take that mission very, very seriously.\nAnd for many Americans, right now, their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge. For most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It's about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won't be a penalty for not purchasing coverage. For the folks in the Medicare system, there will be no changes at all in the current law. But we're talking about those people in the individual and small-group market, the moms and pops, the folks who run the corner grocery store, the corner cleaners. Those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverage.\nAnd then Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care, and we want to make certain that we address that.\nThis is about patients. This is not about money. This is not about something else. This is about patients. And sadly, the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and small-group market. The access is going down, and it's only getting worse. You know the stories. Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year, on average. Arizona had an increase of 116 percent. Deductibles are going up for many, many folks. If you're a mom or a dad out there and you make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, your deductible in this market, in that individual and small-group market, oftentimes is $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 a year.\nWhat that means is you've got an insurance card but you don't get care because you can't afford the deductible. And we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the care.\nA third of the counties in the United States -- one-third of the counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. One insurer is not a choice. So we need to make certain that we correct that.\nIn Tennessee this morning, it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Insurers are leaving the market on the exchange. Last year there were 232 insurers that were providing coverage -- that were offering coverage on the exchange; now there are 167. That's a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone. And all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they need.\nNow, the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability, we want a system that's affordable for everybody. Accessibility, we need a system that's accessible for everybody. A system that's of the highest quality, a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system, and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountability.\nThe President spoke last week, last Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, and he laid out his principles. First, wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market. Nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosis.\nIn terms of affordability, health savings accounts -- growing choices for patients is incredibly important. Tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, not that the government forces them to buy. We've always talked about -- in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place, that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage.\nThose, again, in the employer-sponsored market, they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage. Those folks that are out there in the individual and small-group market, no tax benefit. And that's what this plan would do.\nState flexibility. It's incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is, have the flexibility, especially in the Medicaid program, to be able to respond to their vulnerable population.\nLawsuit abuse. The President mentioned, and it's incredibly important, that -- the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year, and we need to make certain that we're addressing that as well. The President also talked about a glide path, an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country, and that's important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks.\nBuying across state lines, buying insurance across state lines. The President talked about this on the campaign over and over. The American people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines, and it increases competition. And we need to make certain that that happens, and then addressing the incredible increase in drug prices.\nThere are three phases of this plan. One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives. That's the start of all of this. Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place. As you all well know, the previous administration used regulations to a fare-thee-well -- in fact, there were 192 specific rules that were put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5,000 letters of guidance and the like. And we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients, then we need to continue them. If they harm patients or increase costs, then obviously they need to be addressed. And then there's other legislation that will need to be addressed that can't be done through the reconciliation process.\nSo the goal of all of this is patient-centered healthcare, where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions, and not the federal government. We commend the House for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process.\nAnd I look forward to a few questions. Yes, sir.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you're familiar from your time in the House with the clout that conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action have with rank-and-file members. What does it say about this legislation that these groups are already out with opposition to it?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the beginning of the process. And we look forward to working with them and others to make certain that, again, we come up with that process that aligns with the principles that we've defined that they actually adhere to or agree with as well, and that is that we need a system that's affordable for folks, a system that's accessible for individuals, that's of the highest quality, that incentivizes innovation, and that empowers patients.\nAnd so we look forward to working with them through this process.\nQ: Secretary, Congressman Chaffetz said today that Americans may need to forgo a new iPhone to pay for healthcare, and they'll have to kind of make these choices. Does the administration agree with that? Will Americans under this plan -- will they need to maybe sacrifice other goods to pay for their healthcare?\nSECRETARY PRICE: This is an important question, because what's happening right now is that the American people are having to sacrifice in order to purchase coverage. And, as I mentioned, many individuals can't afford the kind of coverage that they have right now. So they've got that insurance card but they don't have care.\nWhat our desire is, is to drive down the healthcare costs for everybody. And the way that you do that is to increase choices for folks, increase competition, return the regulation of healthcare where it ought to be, which is at the state level, not at the federal level. All of these things that, taken in their aggregate, will in fact decrease the costs of healthcare and health coverage, and that will allow folks to be able to purchase the coverage that they want.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Dr. Price. I have two questions for you. First has to do with guarantees that you can make as the administration's point person on this legislation. Can you guarantee that whatever legislation emerges and makes it to the President's desk will allow individuals, if they like their doctor they can keep their doctor? And the second guarantee is, can you also guarantee that healthcare premiums for individuals will come down with this new legislation?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Again, a remarkably important question because, as you'll recall, the promise from the last administration was if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your plan you can keep your plan. Both of those promises turned out to be not true.\nWe think it's incredibly important for the American people to be able to select the physician and the place where they're treated themselves, that the government ought not be involved in that process. And so our goal is absolutely to make certain that individuals have the opportunity to select their physician.\nIn terms of premiums, we believe strongly that through this whole process and as it takes effect, that we'll see a decrease in not only the premiums that individuals will see, but a decrease in the cost of healthcare for folks. Remember, that was another promise that the previous administration made, that you'd see a decrease in $2,500 on average for families across this land; in fact, what they've seen is an increase of $2,500 or $3,000.\nSo we're going to go in the other direction. We're going to go in a direction that empowers patients and holds down costs.\nYes.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you are quite a distance away from conservatives with this plan in the central part of it, which is tax credits, which they see as yet another entitlement, very similar to the entitlement of Obamacare but different in form. How do you convince them, since it's going to take tax credits to make this work, that they need to swallow this and move forward with the bill? I mean, you're getting an awful lot of opposition on the central tenet of this whole thing.\nSECRETARY PRICE: This is all about patients. And in order to provide that transition and in order to make it so that nobody falls through the cracks. We've got to have a system that allows for individuals to gain the kind of coverage that they want.\nAnd we, conservatives and others, have said for a long, long time that we believe it's important to equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing coverage, gaining coverage through their employer, and those not. And the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to equalize that tax treatment. Folks have talked about this for many, many years, actually, so that there's not a distortion in the tax code for who's able to gain a benefit for being able to purchase coverage and not.\nQ: Sir, Mr. Secretary, you were talking about making sure people don't fall through the cracks. The last administration, with Obamacare, focused in on making sure the underserved were part of the equation. What is the safety net or the safeguard that you have to make sure -- to ensure people don't fall through the cracks beyond the tax incentives, but also for the underserved, who are now part of -- many are now part of the program that weren't before, prior to Obamacare.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this is extremely important as well. And the current system, as you likely know, for those vulnerable in our population, especially in the Medicaid population, this is a system that's broken. You've got a third of the physicians in this country -- one-third of the doctors in this country that would be eligible to see Medicaid patients who aren't seeing Medicaid patients right now. And it's not because they've forgotten how to take care of patients, it's because of the rules that are in place that make it too onerous or too difficult for them to see Medicaid patients.\nSo we believe that it's important to allow states to have that flexibility to fashion the program for their vulnerable population that actually responds to that population in a way that gives them the authority, them the choices, them the opportunity to gain coverage and the care that they believe most appropriate.\nQ: What if you find out that that is not happening when you give it to the states? Is there some type of punishment or some type of piece that you're going to put in place to make sure that that happens, that they follow through on your intent?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yes, absolutely. There's accountability throughout the plan that we have that would allow for the Secretary and the Department to be certain that the individuals that we believe need to be cared for are being cared for in the state at the appropriate level. But we believe this is a partnership. This is about patients and partnership.\nThe previous administration tended to make it about government. We believe it's about patients and partnership, and we want to partner with every single person in this land who wants to make certain that we allow the kind of choices and quality to exist.\nQ: The President tweeted earlier today. He described this bill as \"our wonderful new healthcare bill.\" There's been a little bit of confusion. Does this represent the administration's bill? And is there anything in this bill that the administration cannot support?\nSECRETARY PRICE: This has been a work in progress. As you know, this has been going on for over a year. The work that I had the privilege of participating in when I served in the House of Representatives in the last Congress was open and transparent and we invited folks in to give their ideas. And tens, if not hundreds, of people had input into that process.\nThis grew out of that, and over the past number of weeks, we've been having conversations with folks on the Hill, in the House and in the Senate, and other stakeholders. And so this is a work product that is a result of all of that process. The President and the administration support this step in the right -- what we believe is in the right direction, a step that repeals Obamacare and gets us moving in the direction of those principles that I outlined.\nQ: Do you support everything that's in that bill that's sitting on the table, sir? Do you support everything that's in the bill sitting on the table, sir?\nSECRETARY PRICE: This is a work in progress and we'll work with the House and the Senate in this process. As you know, it's a legislative process that occurs. I'm glad you pointed out the bill is on the table there. As you'll see, this bill right here was the bill that was introduced in 2009 and '10 by the previous administration. Notice how thick that is. Some of you will recall that I actually turned the pages and went through that piece of legislation in a YouTube. The pile on the right is the current bill.\nAnd what it means is that we are making certain that the process, that the decisions that are going to be made are not going to be made by the federal government. They're going to be made by patients and families and doctors.\nOne last --\nQ: Mr. Secretary, given the opposition that John and others have brought up here today, does this plan already need to be salvaged in your view? And how do you do it?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Oh, no. You know what happens with these things. You start at a starting point, people engage and they get involved in the process, sometimes to a greater degree. Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that's currently on the table and that has a -- as a work in progress -- or in process. And we'll work through it.\nQ: So this is a starting point here?\nSECRETARY PRICE: This is an important process to be had. The American people have said to their elected leaders that the Obamacare process for them gaining coverage and care is not working. That's what they've said. And so we believe it's important to respond to the American people and provide a healthcare system that allows for them to purchase the kind of coverage and care that they desire.\nYes.\nQ: You said in your letter to the House chairman that necessary technical and appropriate changes might need to be made for this bill to reach the President's desk. So what specific changes is the White House and the administration looking for in this bill?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, as I mentioned, there are three different phases to this process. One is this bill, this legislation that's working through under the rules of reconciliation, which is a fancy term to mean that there are only certain things that you can do from a budgetary standpoint has to affect either spending or revenue. There are things that you can't do in this bill, and those we plan on doing across the horizon in phase two, which is the regulatory portion, and then in phase three, which is another piece of legislation that would be going through the House and the Senate with a majority -- supermajority in the Senate.\nThat process will incorporate all of the kinds of things that we believe are absolutely necessary to reconstitute that individual and small-group market and to get us in a position, again, where patients and families and docs are making these decisions.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, bearing in mind that the CBO score isn't back yet, can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on deficit or result in millions of Americans losing health insurance?\nSECRETARY PRICE: What I can say is that the goal and the desire I know of the individuals on the Hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal government.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, two elements of the bill. I have questions about how they control costs and how they help with access. The Medicaid per-capita block grant through the states, how is that sort of fundamentally different from the Obamacare regime on Medicaid in terms of expanding access?\nAnd then the second point, why doesn't this bill do away with the cost-sharing community ratings regime that Obamacare had?\nSECRETARY PRICE: So the per-capita cap, Medicaid, again, is a system that doesn't work for patients. You've got folks out there who need care, who need to see particular physicians who aren't able to see them. All Americans should be saddened by the situation that we have when there are patients out there that can't get the care that they need. We believe one of the keys to providing appropriate care in the Medicaid population is allowing the states to have the flexibility to address that Medicaid population.\nRemember, Medicaid population is four different demographic groups. It's those who are disabled, it's those who are seniors, it's healthy moms and kids, by and large. Those are the four main demographic groups. And we, the federal government, force states, mostly, to take care of those individuals in exactly the same way. If you describe that to the folks back home on Main Street, they say, that doesn't make any sense at all. You need a program that's different for the healthy moms and kids to respond to their needs that's different than folks who are disabled and seniors.\nAnd so what we believe is appropriate is to say to the states, you know your population best. You know best how to care for your vulnerable population. We're going to watch you and make certain that you do so, but you know how to do that. And that will decrease costs markedly in the Medicaid program. We're wasting significant amounts of money -- not that folks are getting too much care, we're wasting it because it's inefficient and there's significant abuse in the system.\nSo in terms of the cost-sharing, I think that the cost-sharing measures are being addressed. It's important that we run through that process. This is the process where we felt the previous administration was spending money that they didn't have the authority to spend, and Congress is working through that to make certain that the rightful holders of the authority to spend money in this nation, which is the Congress of the United States, exercises that authority.\nQ: How does the White House and you feel about the label \"Trumpcare\"?\nSECRETARY PRICE: I'll let others provide a description for it. I prefer to call it patient care. This is about patients at the end of the day. This isn't about politicians. This isn't about insurance companies. This is about patients. And patients in this nation, especially those in the individual and small-group market, these are the folks.\nI had the privilege of going to Cincinnati last week with the Vice President to a small-business roundtable. And one of the business owners, one of the small-business owners there, said he had 18 employees last year at this time. This year, he has 15 employees -- not because he doesn't have the work, but because of the cost of health coverage for those individuals forced him -- forced him -- to let three people go.\nNow, they're being forced to let three people go because the federal government has put in place rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for folks in the individual and small-group market to provide coverage for their employees. This is a system that's not working for people. So if we focus on the patients -- I'll call it patient care. If you focus on the patients, we'll get to the right answer.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, a major complaint -- sorry -- a major complaint of conservatives with phase one of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that it is missing a measure that would allow healthcare to be sold across state lines. Now, the President said this morning that that would be in either phase two or phase three. Is that something that you believe the President could do through executive action, and then you yourself could do? Or is that something that you believe has to be addressed legislatively?\nSECRETARY PRICE: There are different aspects to the purchase across state lines that will allow individuals to gain, again, the kind of choices that they want. Some of this might be able to be done from a regulatory or a rules standpoint. Some of it will require legislation, and that's where we're going to need the assistance of our friends on the other side of the aisle.\nThe American people have demanded that they be able to purchase coverage across state lines, purchase coverage that they want for themselves. So whether it's through association health plans, which allows individuals who are in small-business groups, like the fellow that I just mentioned, to pool together nationally to be able to purchase coverage, or whether it's mom and dad, who don't gain coverage through their employer through something called individual health pools that allows folks to pool together solely for the purpose of purchasing coverage, even though they're not otherwise economically aligned. That allows people -- there are 18 million folks in that individual and small-group market. That would allow those individuals to be able to purchase coverage and get the purchasing power of millions. That's huge power and authority that we want to put in the hands of people, that we want to put in the hands of patients. And some of that may, in fact, require legislation.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you. Two questions but first, Congressman John Faso of New York has said that the issue of denying federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be separate from whatever healthcare bill finally emerges from Congress and is signed into law by the President. Is that the administration's position as well?\nAnd my second question is this. You mentioned earlier the people who had their healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they could keep it. I believe in your state of Georgia, more than a million people had that experience. Will some of the plans that were cancelled be able to come back under the new healthcare plan?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, in terms of Planned Parenthood, we think it's important that the legislature work its will on this process. It's incredibly important that we not violate anybody's conscience. We want to protect the conscience provisions that exist. It's also important to appreciate that through community health centers, the bill that's being proposed right now would allow greater access for women to healthcare in greater numbers of facilities across this land. And they've actually proposed more money for women's healthcare than currently exists. So I think that they're working their best to address that issue.\nIn terms of whether or not old plans that were available before might be available, absolutely. And we believe that the opportunity to provide a robust market, robust choices for individuals across this land will be secured. And, again, that's one of the keys to bringing down the premium costs, of bringing down the cost for health coverage. So we're excited about that and look forward to that coming to pass.\nQ: If the new plan calls for repealing the revenue-generating taxes and penalties but keeping the entitlements, how is that sustainable?\nSECRETARY PRICE: That's the work that somebody mentioned over here -- the Congressional Budget Office score, and once the Congress receives that score, then they'll be working through that to make certain that in fact it is fiscally responsible.\nImagine, if you would, however, a system where the incentives within the system are all to drive down costs, to provide greater choices and competition for folks, and respond to the specific needs of patients. And in so doing, what you do is actually get a much more efficient system for the provision and the delivery of healthcare. It's a system we don't have right now because the previous administration felt that the government -- the federal government ought to do all of this. And we've seen what came about when the federal government does all of that -- that it's increasing premiums, increasing deductibles, decreasing choices. You've got a card that says you've got insurance, and you walk in, and you can't afford what it is that's trying to -- for the doctor that's trying to take care of you.\nSo this is not a system that's working for folks in that individual and small-group market and in the exchanges.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, many have complained that Obamacare resulted in higher wait times in the emergency room. Will this new bill cause that? Have you have any idea on that?\nSECRETARY PRICE: One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of healthcare, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite. And much of that is because of, again, the rules and the regulations that they put in place.\nSo from our perspective, we believe that if individuals are able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, then they'll have access to the kind of doctors and other providers that they desire, and won't need to be able to be seen in the emergency room. They'll already have the care. Emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies, not for the standard care that individuals tend to receive right now.\nSo we believe that if you put in place the right system, then emergency rooms and emergency physicians will be able to have the opportunity to care for those individuals that appropriately present to their department.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, I'm interested in following up on your comment that it's important that no one vote on anything that violates their conscience. Federal funding already can't be used for abortions, but are you saying that the administration has a position on provision of birth control at these community health centers? And secondly, is the administration looking to actively withhold funding to Planned Parenthood if they continue to provide abortions, as has been reported?\nSECRETARY PRICE: We're working through all of those issues. As you know, many of those were through the rule-making process and we're working through that. So that's not a part of this piece of legislation right here.\nQ: But you don't have a view on provision of birth control and access to it? When you're talking about women's healthcare, which you brought up, and saying you wanted to expand more community funding.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, what we're doing, as I say, is working through the rules and the regulations to see where the previous administration was, see how they did it, and whether or not it needs to be addressed. With the understanding that what we believe is important when we look at the rules and regulations is to define whether or not that rule or regulation actually helps patients and decreases costs, or harms patients and increases costs. If it does the latter, then we need to do away it. If it does the former, then we ought to accentuate it.\nQ: What was the issue of conscience you were talking about? What was the issue of conscience you were talking about then?\nSECRETARY PRICE: To make certain that individuals in the market are not forced to do things that violate their conscience.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Secretary, thank you, sir. Common people and the small businesses have been waiting for this new bill under President Trump. So any message, sir, for them?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the culmination of years of work. It's the culmination of years of concern and frustration by the American people. They knew at the time that the previous bill -- the previous law passed that it wasn't going to help them. They knew that costs were going to go up. In fact, we predicted at the time that costs would go up and that access would go down. And so this is the culmination of years of hard work by the electorate, by the citizens of this country to say that we want a system, again, that respects patients and families and doctors in these decisions.\nOne more.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The President tweeted out earlier today that he believes that he's working on a plan to have drug prices come down by spurring competition. Can you tell us a little bit about what that plan is going to be, when it might be rolled out? Is it part of these phases? And then the second question, the bill also includes a tax break for insurance executives that make more than $500,000. You said this is about patients. Why is that tax break important for this legislation?\nSECRETARY PRICE: To the latter, I'm not aware of that. I'll look into that.\nDrug pricing is really important. So many individuals are now having significant difficulty being able to afford the medications that they've been prescribed. And it's not able to be addressed specifically in this phase one because it's not a revenue or spending issue for the federal government. So it can't be in this phase one.\nBut in phase two and three -- which may be concurrent along with this phase one -- but in phase two and three, then we look forward to bringing solutions, to solve the remarkable challenge that patients have across this line with the increase in pricing of drugs.\nI've got to run. You've got a guy right here who is going to answer all the rest of the questions. Thank you so much. God bless you.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Dr. Price.\nLet me just kind of continue on. The bottom line I think that the Secretary was making is that Obamacare sought to cover 20 million people and in the process it drove up costs for everybody, whether or not you were in the exchange or not. Most people get their insurance through their employers. Older populations get their healthcare through Medicare. Low-income populations get their healthcare through Medicaid. And veterans get their insurance through TRICARE. So what we're talking about here is a very defined amount of individuals that we're trying to address and not affect the entire system.\nObamacare turned our healthcare system on its head to address the pool of individuals who don't fall into any of the buckets that I mentioned. Our plan that we're talking about today with the House will ensure that those individuals receive the care that they need if they want an affordable cost while not sending rates skyrocketing.\nObamacare was an overcomplicated bill that served the special interests and not the American people. These over 974 pages that were passed and then we were told we had to read them are filled with carve-outs by over $1 billion of healthcare- related lobbying that were spent on the year that Obamacare was crafted.\nOur plan, in far fewer pages, 123 -- much smaller, much bigger -- so far we're at 57 for the repeal plan and 66 pages for the replacement portion. We'll undo this. And remember, half of it, 57 of those pages, are the repeal part. So when you really get down to it, our plan is 66 pages long, half of what we actually even have there. We'll undo the massive disaster and replace it with a plan to return healthcare back to the patient.\nAs the President outlined in his joint address, he expects five core principles to guide Congress through this healthcare process. First, ensure that the American people with preexisting conditions have access to coverage. Second, ensure a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the exchanges. Third, provide more equitable tax treatment through tax credits for people who already don't receive tax-advantage healthcare from their employer. And I know -- something that Secretary Price was talking about -- for the vast number of people who get their insurance through their employer, they're getting it tax free. They are not taxed on that benefit, which is something that is not afforded to people who are in the individual market who either run a small business or are sole proprietors.\nFourth, we should expand the power of health savings accounts to return control to Americans over their healthcare dollar and decisions. They should be able to choose the plan they want, not the plan that's forced on them by government. And finally, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicare to make sure that no one is left out.\nThis is the Obamacare replacement plan that everyone has been asking for, the plan that the President ran on, and the plan that will ultimately save the system. It's also a culmination of years of dedicated work and careful thought by Republicans to find a replacement that will best undo the damage that's been caused by Obamacare while ensuring that all Americans have peace of mind during this stable transition period.\nThese are the principles for which conservatives have been fighting for for years. President Trump looks forward to continuing the dialogue between the administration and the Hill on saving the healthcare system.\nWhat's important to remember is that we're not going to be able to do all of this on one bill. As the Secretary mentioned, there are two other steps as well that allow us to get more of the President's plan accomplished after we pass this first important, major step.\nThe second piece is already underway, and that's what Secretary Price can do through executive action. He has already rolled out a handful of important actions, including the major marketplace stabilization regulation, to help bring stability to the collapsing insurance market. He'll continue to enact a number of policy changes in the regulatory and administration space -- administrative space to achieve what the first step cannot because of the nature of reconciliation.\nThe third piece of executing the President's healthcare plan is on -- requires 60 votes in legislation, maybe more depending on what we can do and when. That's how we'll move forward on the policies of purchasing across state lines, lowering drug prices -- that just came up -- and repealing any of Obamacare's premium-spiking insurance market distortions that can't be done through this current bill.\nAlso, yesterday, in addition to speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, the President also had separate calls with Prime Minister of Japan, Abe, and South Korea's Acting President Hwang. During both of these calls the President reiterated the United States' ironclad commitment to stand with Japan and South Korea in the face of the serious threat posed by North Korea.\nHe also emphasized that the administration is taking steps to further enhance our ability to deter and defend against North Korea's ballistic missiles using a full range of the United States' military capabilities.\nMoving on to today's schedule. This morning, the President had a call with President Kenyatta of Kenya. We'll have a readout for that call soon, if it's not already out. The President and First Lady also announced the official reopening of public tours here at the White House. You may have seen the President stop by to surprise greet some of the first visitors on their tour. We're looking forward to welcoming the people back to -- the American people back what is affectionately referred to as the \"People's House.\"\nWe are the world's only executive residence and office of head of state that also serves as a museum free to the people. Visiting the White House is obviously an experience that's uniquely American, and we encourage guests of all ages to come visit the White House, their house.\nAlso this morning, the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, held a press conference announcing that Chinese ZTE Corporation has agreed to a record-high, combined criminal and civil penalty of $1.19 billion after the company illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea in violation of sanctions. This civil penalty is the largest ever imposed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security and, pending approval from a federal judge, the combined penalties between the Commerce Department, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Treasury would be the largest fine and forfeiture ever levied by the U.S. government in such a case.\nThis settlement tells the world that the days of flouting the U.S. sanctions regime or violating U.S. trade laws are over.\nPresident Trump is committed to ending the disrespect of American laws and American workers.\nSo back to the schedule for a second. This morning the President also received his daily intelligence briefing. He had lunch with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who will continue to be an important partner as the President's nominee for Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, begins the confirmation process in the next couple weeks.\nAt this moment, the President is leading a discussion on immigration with Senator Cotton and Senator Perdue and members of White House senior staff. The President and the senators are expected to discuss the merit-based immigration reforms that the President mentioned at last week's joint address.\nLater this afternoon, the President will lead a meeting with the House Deputy Whip Team focused on repeal and replace of Obamacare. There will be a pool spray at the top of that meeting. The gather time is 3:20 p.m. The President will also meet with Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO. They're expected to discuss the importance of investing in our country's infrastructure and renegotiating trade agreements like NAFTA. There will also be a pool spray at the top of that meeting, and we'll have further details on it.\nThis evening, the President will visit with a group of Boy Scouts who are in Washington to participate in a near-century-old tradition of sharing scouting's achievement with key government officials. Looking ahead, I want to let you know that the President will be welcoming at least two foreign leaders in the coming weeks, and I expect additional announcements of additional leaders later. But first, next week, Chancellor Merkel of Germany will visit the White House. And the following week, the President will welcome Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq.\nWith that, I'll kick it off with your questions. Jonathan Karl.\nQ: Sean, it's been a full --\nMR. SPICER: Jonathan.\nQ: Thank you. (Laughter.) Sean, it's been a full --\nMR. SPICER: You're out of practice.\nQ: I know. (Laughter.) It's been a full three days since the President said that President Obama had his wires tapped, his phones tapped at Trump Tower. In those three days, has the White House come up with any evidence whatsoever to prove that allegation?\nMR. SPICER: I addressed this multiple times yesterday. I think the President -- we put out a statement on Sunday saying that we would have no further comment and we were asking the House and the Senate intelligence committees to look into this concern and report back.\nQ: Can't the President just ask the FBI director if this happened? Has he asked him?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think -- no, the President has not. And I think that we've gone back and forth with you guys -- I think there is clearly a role that Congress can play in its oversight capabilities. They've made it very clear that they have the staff, the resources and the process. I think that's the appropriate place for this to handle. I think if we were to start to get involved you would then write stories about how we were getting involved.\nSo it's a no-win situation. I think the smartest and most deliberative way to address this situation is to ask the House and Senate intelligence committees who are already in the process of looking into this to look into this and other leaks of classified information that are troubling to our nation's national security.\nSo, as the President said in the statement on Sunday, we believe that that investigation, as well as the investigation of other classified leaks and other important information that threatens our national security, be looked into by the House and Senate intelligence committees, and then we encourage them to report back.\nQ: Do you believe that President Obama ordered something like this?\nMR. SPICER: I get that that's a cute question to ask. My job is to represent the President and to talk about what he's doing and what he wants. And he has made very clear what his goal is, what he would like to have happen. And so I'll just leave it at that. I think we've tried to play this game before. I'm not here to speak for myself, I'm here to speak for the President of the United States and our government.\nZeke.\nQ: Sean, one follow-up on what Secretary Price said earlier. I think he was asked by John about whether the administration was willing to make a -- for the American people right now who like their doctor or like their health insurance plan, is the White House willing to make a commitment then today that when this replacement bill is passed, if it passes, that they will at the end of that be able to keep their doctor and keep their healthcare plan?\nAnd secondly, just changing gears radically onto -- China overnight issued some strong rhetoric promising consequences for the deployment of the THAAD missile system to South Korea. If you could respond to that.\nMR. SPICER: So on the first piece, I think -- look, one of the things that's important to understand about this process that's very different from when the Democrats did it -- you'll recall then-Speaker Pelosi said you're going to have to read the bill to know what's in it. I think there's a big difference.\nThis is the bill. It's right here. It's on the website. We're going through regular order. If you go to the House of Representatives website, Speaker Paul Ryan's website, it's listed. Everybody can read it, and it's going to go through what they call regular order. We're not jamming this down anybody's throat. It's going to go through a committee process. All parties involved, all representatives in the House will be able to have input into it.\nI think that's the way to conduct this process, is to do it to allow people to watch the process happen in the committees, allow members of Congress to have their input in it, to make amendments, to see that we get the best bill that achieves the goal for the American people.\nWhen it was done the last time, it was jammed down people's throat, and look what happened. You had 974 pages that people struggled to read afterwards and figure out what had just gotten passed, and the consequences were, frankly, devastating.\nSo to your point about keeping your doctor, in a lot of cases you've lost your doctor for a couple of reasons. One, they may not participate in the plan. They may not take insurance at all anymore. Two, they may not take Medicaid -- or three, they may not take Medicaid. And the list goes on and on about why they might not be there -- or your plan, the plan that you got is no longer accessible.\nAs the Secretary mentioned, one-third of all counties in the United States no longer take Medicaid -- or, excuse me, have only one plan that you can choose from. So it's a fact right now that you -- in most cases, you have no choice. In many cases, you've lost that ability.\nOur goal is to actually add more choice and more competition. Right now, the government tells you, you must have this plan or you will pay a penalty, and within this plan, here's what you have to have. We've lost the element of choice and competition in healthcare, and by bringing all of that back, I think there's a higher degree of likelihood that you're going to get the plan that you want and you're going to get the doctor you want. Because it will be your choice, not the government's choice.\nAnd that's a big, big difference. This plan was jammed down everybody's throat, and the consequences took their plans away, it took their doctors away, and it drove up costs. This plan allows more competition, more people to enter it, and the American people and patients to make a decision on what plan they want. If they have a plan and a doctor they like, then they're going to choose a plan that allows them to continue with that doctor. But there's going to be more competition and more choice, not less. And that's, frankly, what you have now.\nWith respect to China, I think I addressed this yesterday. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan and South Korea in doing what we can to protect that region in particular from an attack from North Korea. We understand the situation and we continue to work with them. As I've mentioned, the President spoke to both leaders yesterday. We provided a readout of those calls. But we obviously understand the concerns of China, but -- this is a national security issue for them.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. How concerned is the President with the situation between North Korea and Malaysia right now?\nMR. SPICER: Well, as I said, I think we're very well aware of the -- what's going on in the region. The President obviously had a conversation with, in particular, the leader -- the acting President of South Korea last night with respect to what's going on there. And again, I'll refer that to the National Security Committee to give you further -- Cheryl Bolen.\nQ: Thanks, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: Cheryl. I know, sorry, I forgot you yesterday.\nQ: I appreciate it. So two questions. One on healthcare. If the CBO scores this bill and it does not provide the amount of coverage that the Affordable Care Act did, will the President still support it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get ahead -- Secretary Price mentioned this -- let's not get ahead of the CBO going through this. But I think, as I mentioned to Zeke, one of the things that's important to understand there's -- this is -- this bill has to be done in the phases that it has to to address the repeal part of it, and the replace part of it.\nThere are only certain things that we can do through reconciliation. I know there's the regulatory piece that we can do through actions that the Secretary is empowered to do, frankly, under Obamacare. And then third is an additional piece of legislation that addresses things.\nBut there are cost-saving measures that -- and competition aspects of this that have to be included in phase two or three because they're not allowed in the reconciliation bill because of the nature of how reconciliation works on Capitol Hill.\nSo I think that one of the things that we have to understand is that how that score comes out from the Congressional Budget Office will depend on whether they look at it specifically with just a phase one or whether they look at it in its totality. But I'm confident that if you look at what's going on right now, Cheryl, it's unsustainable. Premiums in state after state, as Dr. Price mentioned, they're up 25 percent on average. Arizona is 116 percent. I think Oklahoma is the 50s. Minnesota is in the 40s. This is unsustainable for a family to continue to pay the premiums that they have and for individuals, small-business owners, et cetera.\nSo the question is, can we allow people to go on this trajectory where more and more of their paycheck is getting eaten up in a plan that's, frankly, not giving them choice, doctors, or plans that they want. This plan I think clearly achieves those goals a lot better. It gets the price -- cost containment down. It gets price control under it. And it allows doctors and plans to reengage in the marketplace, as they were prior to this. And I think that is a major aspect of it.\nHold on. Cheryl waited.\nQ: Thank you. From yesterday, I had a nominations question. Is there something that's preventing the White House from submitting the nominations of Sonny Perdue for Agriculture and Alex Acosta for Labor?\nMR. SPICER: I believe Alex Acosta was sent up to the Hill earlier today. We should have an announcement officially out. So sometimes there's a little bit of a lag. I apologize between my office and -- but that one is up, and I'll check on Sonny Perdue. I think some of it is just in coordination with the Senate, so pardon my time.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I have two questions for you. First, will the President offer a correction to his tweet this morning that states that 122 prisoners were released from Gitmo by the Obama administration and then returned to the battlefield? Can you take that first?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, I mean, obviously the President meant in totality the number that had been released on the battlefield -- that have been released from Gitmo since -- individuals have been released. So that is correct.\nQ: Then my second question. Is the White House concerned about this new information that came out in WikiLeaks today that U.S. intelligence agencies are potentially, purposely providing vulnerabilities to tech products here in the United States?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on that. I think obviously that's something that has not been fully evaluated, and if it was, I would not comment from here on that.\nKevin.\nQ: Yes, Sean, I was going to ask about branding. The President in the past put his name on buildings and different products. When it comes to healthcare, does the White House feel that the bill presented today should be known as \"Trumpcare\" from here on out? I know it was asked of the Secretary. And at what point do you think that the transition should go away from Obamacare to the new administration?\nMR. SPICER: Well, as soon as it's repealed we can get rid of that. I think that will happen quickly.\nAnd as Secretary Price mentioned, I think we're less concerned with labels right now and more in terms of action and results. And I think that's what our focus has been is getting that cost down, getting that choice back that we mentioned. Yeah.\nQ: Sean, DHS is reportedly considering separating families that cross the border illegally. How does the President feel about that?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to -- that's a DHS matter. We don't get involved in either Customs or ICE enforcement. So I think that's a question better reserved to both DHS and ICE specifically.\nJim.\nQ: Oh, thanks, Sean. On the Obamacare question, one of the criticisms on this is that there is still a de facto individual mandate because it allows insurance companies to increase premiums up to 30 percent of people -- if there's a gap in coverage. And I have one more.\nMR. SPICER: Well, that's not -- the difference is under the current bill that's here, if you don't buy insurance, you pay a fine. Under the current bill you don't have -- there's nothing that mandates you to buy insurance. That's up to an individual. So by its very definition, it is not -- can't be considered that.\nWhat's your second one?\nQ: Well, you don't think it's a de facto mandate in the sense of there's a penalty --\nMR. SPICER: It can't be.\nQ: -- in place as there is now? Not by the government, but is by the insurance companies.\nMR. SPICER: Right. But there's no -- I think you answered your own question on that one.\nQ: I have one more.\nMR. SPICER: Okay.\nQ: Another topic. The President has blamed the Democrats in the Senate for blocking the Cabinet. Last Thursday, the Republicans actually called a recess early -- adjourned on Thursday early. Previously they called a recess the week before. Does the President have any plans to call for the Senate to remain in session and the Congress to stay in session until they approve the nominees and maybe even also repeal Obamacare?\nMR. SPICER: This isn't a Republican issue. I mean it's not Republicans that are playing beat the clock on a lot of these nominees. And we've discussed this since the transition time. There were several nominees that, frankly, weren't even considered controversial by the standards of Senate Democratic leadership, and yet have been held up over and over again. I don't think -- that's a very different scenario than going back and being with constituents, which was on the Senate schedule. So I don't think -- that's a synonymous thing.\nDo we have Michael Medved ready to go for a Skype question? Michael?\nQ: Yes, hello. Sean, thank you very much. Obviously, today there was a big emphasis on Obamacare, which is profoundly important to the American people. But it seems that too often in the last several weeks, the administration has gotten distracted and media have gotten distracted by talk of wiretapping at Trump Tower, or the President calling his predecessor a \"bad\" and \"sick guy\" or criticizing the ratings of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" Do you think the White House could do a better job of focusing on the issues that really matter, the reforms that matter to the American people rather than getting distracted to these subsidiary conflicts as we move forward into the coming months?\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, Michael. Respectfully, I would say that we have been focused. We're here talking about Obamacare and the need to drive down the cost and access for healthcare for every American. I think that's a pretty significant thing to be focused on.\nYesterday, we were talking about the President's effort to continue to keep the nation safe, to make sure that people aren't coming into the country who aren't here for peaceful purposes. The President has talked to almost 50 world leaders. He's had 30-plus executive actions on all sorts of stuff from regulatory aspects to things that will create more jobs. I think that's a fairly focused effort.\nThat being said, I think, look, whether it was Candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, or now President Trump, the President has always made it very clear -- or not he made it clear, but I think the voters made it clear that one of the things that they appreciate about him is his ability to be authentic and to speak very forcefully and very directly with the American people. And that's an aspect that I think was central to why he was elected, is because he's not a canned politician that's going to give the same staid answers over and over again.\nSara.\nQ: Going back to Fred's question, conservatives have started to call this \"Obamacare Lite.\" But President Trump has promised to fully repeal Obamacare, but this bill leaves a lot of the structure of Obamacare intact. If this is the policy that passes, is President Trump confident in the future he can say that he fully repealed Obamacare?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, absolutely. As I mentioned, the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it. There are three things, I mean -- each phase that we've talked about, phase one, phase two, and phase three, there's a repeal-and-replace aspect in each one. But Republicans and conservatives have been talking about adding competition and driving costs down for decades now, selling across state lines, small-business pooling. All of those things have been part of conservative plans for a long time. And I think instilling that competition in it, allowing more access -- I think there is a big difference.\nThere is no -- we have for the longest time -- if you're a conservative, you think about this right now that you have -- anyone who has an employer-based -- their job comes from an employer that gives them healthcare, they're getting a subsidy. They're getting a credit. They don't pay taxes on their healthcare, and their employer doesn't either. That's a huge disadvantage to anyone who is a sole proprietor or owns a small business.\nAnd so, frankly, to allow the playing field to be leveled and allow small businesses, which are, frankly, the job creators in this country, to allow entrepreneurs and self-starters to get the same tax treatment that a Fortune 500 company gets you is a very conservative principle.\nAnd again, look, one of the things that's important, Sara, is for all of the people who have concerns about this -- especially on the right -- look at the size. This is the Democrats, this is us. You can't get any clearer in terms of this is government, this is not.\nAnd I think that part of the reason the visual is important is that when you actually look at the difference, you realize this is what big government does. It crowds out competition. It drives up prices. It stifles entrepreneurship and innovation. Doctors leaving the markets. More and more people not taking Medicaid or TRICARE. That should concern people. When you've got veterans that can't -- because most of the time, Medicaid and TRICARE are tied together. So when you have those systems not accepted by doctors, that means the lowest of our -- people on the low-income scale and people who have served our country have fewer and fewer choices. That alone should be a problem and concerning for many people.\nBut the premium spikes are another problem. Because again, even if you're in the exchange, now you're seeing over and over again that happen. You're also seeing young people decide that they'd rather just pay a penalty because the cost of those basic programs is out of reach for a lot of young people who are just entering the job market.\nBut again, I think the greatest illustration of the differences in the approaches is that size. Our bill, which is a tenth of the size, does repeal and replace in what their bill just did in massive government bureaucracy. And that is a big difference.\nJim.\nQ: Just want to ask you -- I mean you had the Health and Human Services Secretary out here, you just talked about this is the Republican bill, this is the Democrat bill. Is that the President's bill? Is that his healthcare bill?\nQ: That is a bill that we have worked with with Congress. We feel very good about where it is. We are looking forward -- as I mentioned earlier, the President is meeting with the Whip Team to encourage them to support it and to build it out. I don't think -- and I'm not trying to be cute here -- but I think it's not his bill or their bill. It's a bill that we have worked on with them together. We're very proud of where it stands now.\nThe big difference, Jim, is that, unlike before, as I mentioned, when the Democrats jammed it down people's throat and said -- waited to get that 60th vote, with Senator Kennedy still around, and then basically said, literally, you will have to wait and see what it looks like before we passed it -- we not only posted it out there for everybody to look at, but by sending it through regular order, not just putting it up for a House vote, but sending it through the committee process, allows Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike to offer up amendments and suggestions. And the House will work its will.\nNow, we will continue to give guidance and thoughts and suggestions. But I think the President's core principles are what's going to guide us as we head through the Hill and then -- the House and then to the Senate.\nQ: And just one quick follow-up on Jonathan Karl's question, because the President made a very serious allegation over the weekend, and I think we would all be remiss if we went through this briefing and not tried to get you on camera to at least offer us some evidence. Where is the evidence, where is the proof that President Obama bugged President Trump?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I answered this question yesterday on camera on your air. So just so we're clear -- I know this is now -- it will be twice. But I think I made it clear yesterday --\nQ: But since yesterday, since yesterday --\nMR. SPICER: Nothing has changed.\nQ: -- is there any new proof --\nMR. SPICER: No. And it's not a question of new proof or less proof, or whatever. The answer is the same, which is that I think that there is a concern about what happened in the 2016 election. The House and Senate intelligence committees have the staff and the capabilities and the processes in place to look at this in a way that's objective. And that's where it should be done. And, frankly, if you've seen the response from -- especially on the House side, but as well as the Senate, they welcome this.\nAnd so let's let the Senate do their job and the House -- excuse me -- intelligence committees, and then report back to the American people.\nQ: Will the President withdraw the accusation? Does he have any --\nMR. SPICER: Why would he withdraw it until it's adjudicated? That's what we're asking, is for them to look at this and see if there is --\nQ: No regrets with him about raising this accusation?\nMR. SPICER: No. Absolutely not. And I think that what he wants them to do is to look into wiretapping, other surveillance, and again, as I mentioned before, the other leaks that are threatening our national security. You're seeing the leaks happen over and over again that come out throughout the administration, throughout government, and undermine national security. And I think the appropriate thing to do is to ask the House and the Senate to look into it.\nGlenn Thrush.\nQ: To follow up on a follow-up, in terms of -- you were given the opportunity on air to say whether or not the President still supported Director Comey. Does the President support Director Comey? And I have a quick follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: I have no reason to believe he doesn't. He has not suggested that to me. So now to the non-follow-up to the --\nQ: Have you seen any evidence yourself? Has the evidence been shared with you or other senior members of the President's staff as to why he made this particular accusation?\nMR. SPICER: As far as me, no. I'm not in a position that that would be regularly part of my daily duties for the President to sit down and go through that. That's probably a level above my pay grade. But as I've mentioned, I think the President believes that the appropriate place for this to be adjudicated is for the House and Senate intelligence committees who have the clearances, the staff, the processes, to go through this, look at it and report back.\nQ: Did he share it with --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get in -- as the President made very clear, Glenn --\nQ: -- with his National Security Advisor?\nMR. SPICER: As the President said in the statement that he issued on Sunday, we're not going to have further comment on this until this matter is resolved.\nYes.\nQ: Two quick questions. So just to follow up on the follow-up. So does the White House feel that it's appropriate -- you say that you want it to be adjudicated by the congressional committees, but the President made declarative statements on Twitter.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: So I guess, is the White House position that the President can make declarative statements about a former President basically committing a crime and then the congressional committees should look into that and basically prove it? I mean, how does that exactly --\nMR. SPICER: I take issue with -- it's not a question of \"prove it.\" I think as I said, now, five times to a follow-up to a follow-up, that it's not a question of \"prove it.\" It's that they have the resources and the clearances and the staff to fully and thoroughly and comprehensively investigate this and then issue a report as to what their findings are.\nQ: But President Trump's Twitter statement shouldn't be taken at face value about what --\nMR. SPICER: Sure it should. Of course, it -- I mean, why\n-- no. There's nothing -- as I mentioned to Jim, it's not that he's walking anything back or regretting. He's just saying that they have the appropriate venue and capabilities to review this.\nMargaret. I'm sorry.\nQ: So on the Obamacare replacement, so you said that it will be in phases and that you're going to need additional legislation. So just to clarify, are the cost savings that you guys are projecting, is that dependent on phase three of the national competition plan? Because if that's the case then --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, well, it's not dependent. I think that in order to see it fully come to fruition, yeah, you have to see all parts of it. But the way that it was passed doesn't allow for -- the way that it was passed is almost the same way that we're going through this now, which is they pass certain things, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the time, was granted significant regulatory authority that allowed her to do certain things at the time to implement pieces of Obamacare that we now have to act backwards and go almost in the same steps to do what they did to lay it out. We've got to repeal it, and then we've got to replace it with the plan that's going to do the same.\nCertain things can be done in the same way and certain things can't. It just -- it literally depends on how that was done.\nJohn Frederick.\nQ: Sean, in the replacement plan, it says that the states that accepted the Medicare expansion money would continue to be funded. So what is the message you have to Republican state legislators that thought they were fiscally responsible in rejecting Medicaid expansion in their states and now they didn't get the federal dollars on either end? What is your response to them?\nMR. SPICER: I think what we need to do is to make sure, as the President said in his statements, as Secretary Price did, we've got to make sure that we continue to protect people through this transition process. Let the bill work its way. But this is the first time -- as we address the Medicaid portion of this, this is probably the first time that we've really addressed an entitlement aspect of something in almost 30 years. So I think we've got to let this piece of it work its way through the House.\nBut there is -- remember, one of the things that happened through the Medicaid expansion was the goal has always been about Medicaid to help people who were disabled or poor or met a specific number of criteria. For the first time in Obamacare, we expanded Obamacare -- or the Obama administration did, rather -- to able-bodied individuals that -- in a way that had never been done before, and it was not a specific class. That's led largely to the ballooning cost.\nI think a lot of the reforms that will be contained in this bill will address that, but I think we've got to let it work its will through the process.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, I want to ask you two communications questions on two topics. Because the President gave himself a middling grade on communication, let me ask you about the experience that the previous administration had when Obamacare was going through its own phases. The President -- President Obama said that the opposition to the legislation was able to seize the opportunity while it was being legislated to create public perceptions about what was in the legislation. So my question is on ACA. What is the President going to do to improve his communications, to be out there, explaining what is in the bill, to work with lawmakers? That's the first question. And then I'll ask you the next one.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, thank you. So on the first one, as I've mentioned, he's had and continues to have significant outreach to members of Congress. He's talked to health insurers. I mean, I think we've read out a lot of the activities of the last couple weeks. And literally, in just -- within an hour, he's going to sit down with the House Deputy Whip Team to talk about the legislative piece of this in the House.\nSo this is going to be a very aggressive, laser-like focus of this administration over the next month or two to get this thing through the House and then moved over to the Senate. But there's a big difference, Alexis. What we're doing is vastly different. They were expanding government, promising people something. And I think what's happened is there was a lot of difference with how they approach it.\nRight now, the American people, no matter where you are, you understand the state of your healthcare, the costs that you're seeing and the lack of choice that you've now been presented with. And in many cases, you realize that when you go in to see the doctor or a loved one is going to see a doctor that they're not getting -- they're not either able to get in, they're not taking the Medicare or the exchange insurance that they got, the costs are going out of control.\nAnd I think it's really interesting -- I mean, one of the things that Dr. Price mentioned that is so apropos of this is, having a card does not mean you have insurance. It's like handing someone a blank check -- it doesn't mean that you have money, it means you have a check. And I think what we've seen over the last few years with Obamacare is you can have an insurance card, but that doesn't mean someone is going to take it, and it sure doesn't mean that it's going to be affordable. And there's a big difference between having a card and having healthcare that's affordable. And that's the difference that we're trying to solve right now.\nSo when it comes to communication, I think one of the things that's really helpful is that part of the sell is done for us. The American people understand the state of their healthcare. They understand how much they're paying for. They've gone to see a doctor or gone to a hospital or had a notice from their carrier saying we are no longer part of this, or their employer says, hey, whatever your particular carrier is, is no longer available, we're switching you into this.\nAnd so for so many Americans, healthcare is a very, very real part of their daily experience because they're caring for themselves, they're dealing with an ailment, or dealing with children or a loved one or someone else in their family where they're seeing, firsthand, the devastation and disaster that Obamacare has caused them in their personal life.\nSo I think there's a welcoming of this effort and I think it's a lot easier for us to go in -- because we don't have to explain the problem. People are living it. And I think for them to understand what we're giving you is more choice, greater competition. We're incentivizing more people to be part of the process, and we're going to be driving down the cost of those premiums.\nYou had a second.\nQ: My second question on communications has to do with the President's assertion about the wiretapping. Because the White House wants this now to be handled by the legislative branch, and in confidence and in classification, can we count on the President to, himself, while this investigation is going on, to cease and desist using Twitter or any other public venue to make accusations that are in public but he will not respond to in public?\nMR. SPICER: With respect to this particular situation? I'll ask that and I'll get back to you on that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Just getting back to the question about if one likes his or her healthcare, they can keep it. In 2013, Congressman Fred Upton, then Chairman of the House Energy Committee, offered legislation that put precisely those words into law and it received the votes of every Republican member in the House and between 40 and 50 Democrats, and then it died in the Senate. Would the administration support a revival of the Upton Amendment? In other words, putting the right to keep one's healthcare plan and doctor if he or she liked it, today?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, I think that's the goal. I don't want to start talking about what we're going to -- as we go through the process. We've now put our stamp on this and sent it to the House. It will work its will as amendments come up through regular order. Our team will weigh in on those with their staff and, again, the President is meeting with the Whip Team today.\nI don't want to start saying we're going to support this amendment or that amendment now, but I think generally speaking, obviously the goal is to make sure that people get a plan that they like that's affordable, that meets what they need to have met, that they shouldn't have to have a one-size-fits-all, government-instilled healthcare system that doesn't offer any choice or, frankly, isn't tailored to the needs that they have. I think that's an important thing.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, right now you're two votes short of passing repeal-and-replace in the Senate because you've got four Republican senators who are saying they can't support the bill because of rolling back the Medicaid expansion. What do you say to those senators who are very concerned that people will lose coverage that this does not provide enough stability for those people who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's two things, John. One is, we're at day one. We're going to go through the House first, so we've got a little bit of time. And I think as we go through that process, these senators -- and not just the additional two but I think and hope that we'll get additional ones -- they recognize that those people, as I've said over and over again here -- if we do nothing, they're going to be in a very, very worse scenario than they are now.\nMore and more people -- if you're on Medicaid, which serves so many low-income Americans, as I mentioned, they have a card. And that card does not allow them to go to doctor after doctor who are saying, we're not going to take Medicaid or TRICARE anymore.\nSo I would ask those senators, what are you doing to help us work on a bill that will get them insured again? Because for too many Americans, they've got a card, but they don't have insurance. And I think that's a very, very big thing to -- a distinction to make.\nThey're the ones who have the problem right now. They've got a Medicaid card and nowhere to go. And what we need to do is to make sure that low-income Americans, veterans, small business owners, individuals who desperately need healthcare have options and affordability.\nQ: One other piece of this. You could bring down the cost of the insurance itself through efficiencies in the system, selling across state lines. But the biggest driver of the increase in health insurance cost is the skyrocketing cost of medicine. What in this overall plan do you propose to do to either cap the rise or even bring it down?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think you -- the Secretary mentioned this, but I mean, the cost of prescription drugs is --\nQ: That's one small --\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not. It's a big factor. I think that --\nQ: But when you're paying $50,000 out of pocket to get a stent? I mean, it's --\nMR. SPICER: Again, what is the biggest thing missing --\nQ: -- but it's getting out of control.\nMR. SPICER: Fair enough, but --\nQ: Fair enough, drugs is one part of it but -- huge other part of it.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, when you talk about procedures or drugs, the biggest thing that's missing in this whole equation is competition. I mean, we're down to one plan in many places. There's nothing for these places to compete --\nQ: There's plenty of competition between hospitals.\nMR. SPICER: No, there's -- I mean, that's fine, but if they know they're going to get the same reimbursement rate, if they know that there's no other options, that plans aren't trying to get people -- then that's a big difference. Right now, there's a lack of competition in the industry.\nAnd I think one of the President's -- I get it may be one part of that, but you're right, that all-over medicine -- procedures and such -- there's a reason he met with drug executives and talked about getting those costs down; that there's a multi-faceted approach, and how do we instill competition, how do we drive down costs?\nBut you're right, we've got to do more to get the cost of that down, of the procedures to allow additional options. Everything that is -- it's the same way that, again -- think about your insurance. One of the things that was driving up cost in the past was people were exercising the option of going to an emergency room over and over again for their primary care. And what happened is that you saw all of these \"clinics\" pop up from around and insurance carriers actually made it cheaper in terms of co-pays to go see that than an emergency room, driving people to somewhere that didn't continue to drive up cost, clog insurance. That competition alone starts saving the plans money and helping to keep cost down. We've got to instill more aspects of competition in medicine.\nJennifer.\nQ: Sean, can you give us an update on the effort to roll back regulations? Have the taskforce -- regulatory reform taskforces identified any regulations to roll back? And have any actually been repealed?\nMR. SPICER: I think that they have had their work cut out for them. They've started as they -- the President has met with different industries and companies, corporations, associations. That is a constant subject of discussion, which is those regulatory aspects of our economy that are keeping companies from growing, expanding and hiring. And so I know that the domestic policy team and others have been working on that. And if I can get further updates on specific legislation or, excuse me, specific regulatory action, I'll get back to you.\nHallie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two topics for you. I'm trying to get some clarity on something that my colleagues have tried to follow up on as well. You've said that the President stands by his tweets Saturday morning that President Obama ordered this wiretap. You've also said that the administration wants Congress -- let me just be clear -- he found out this information. You've also said that the President wants Congress to investigate. Some members of Congress, by the way, have asked the White House and asked the President to come forward with that information. So bottom line, why would the President want Congress to investigate for information he already has?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a separation-of-powers aspect here as I mentioned to Jonathan that we think it's --\nQ: Talk about resources and time -- why waste that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's not a question of waste it. It's a question of appropriateness.\nQ: But if the President has the info, Sean -- and I guess that's what I'm trying to get to -- if he's sitting on this information that he found out, he's now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this. And you talked about they have resources and staff, which they do, but why expend those resources and staff if the President found out this information and has it?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a difference between directing the Department of Justice, which may be involved in an ongoing investigation, and asking Congress as a separate body to look into something and add credibility to the look -- adds an element that wouldn't necessarily be there if we were directing the Department of Justice, for example. But again, I think we've made it very clear how he wants this done and where we go from there.\nQ: Second question then. Millions of Americans are working on their tax returns right now. Will the President commit to releasing his tax returns for this year and is he still under audit for his past returns?\nMR. SPICER: My understanding is he's still under audit and I'll follow up on the question.\nQ: Question and quick follow-up. How do you understand what we've seen on the growing number of cases at the Canadian border of Canadians born and raised in Canada with valid passports being stopped at the border and told just to go back? They won't let them come in and -- in the U.S.\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of that. I think that's something that probably should be addressed to the Department of Homeland Security.\nQ: Do you think there might be a misunderstanding of the messages sent on the immigration --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I think it's a good question that is probably best directed towards the Department of Homeland Security.\nDr. Swan.\nQ: Thank you. Is the White House going to keep its promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement? And our understanding is that there is some divisions of opinion -- Rex Tillerson wants to stay in; Steve Bannon wants to get out. What's going on? Will you keep the promise? If not, why not?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's something I'd be glad to follow up with you and everyone. I don't have anything on that right now. I'm aware of the discussion of it, so let me -- if I can, I'll get back to you\nMike.\nQ: I have an unrelated question, but I also want to follow up on something --\nMR. SPICER: Unrelated questions are my favorite. (Laughter.)\nQ: You talked about the communications strategy. Will the President play a public role in selling this bill? Will he speak to the public about it? Will he answer questions about it?\nMR. SPICER: That's a good question. I think that we are going to have a very comprehensive strategy. As I mentioned, just a few minutes from now the President is going to engage with members of the House Whip Team to talk to them.\nQ: -- talking to members of Congress.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, but -- and I understand that. This is step one. There's a lot of time -- as I mentioned, we expect to be dealing with this for the next several weeks. There will be plenty of opportunities for the President to speak about that, to engage with the public. But it's going to be a comprehensive plan that we will discuss.\nWe had I can't even begin to tell you how many administration folks, members of Congress flooding the broadcast and radio airwaves today, both nationally and in local markets. We were very, very active throughout the country getting out the word on what we're doing and why we're doing it, from national broadcast shows to cable to -- I mean, to radio. We had a very, very aggressive start to this effort. We're working with the House, in particular. We're continuing to start really engaging with the Senate.\nBut this is going to be a comprehensive effort, working with the House and the Senate, to get this thing done, and other partners -- doctors and outside groups that share this concern. As I mentioned earlier to one of the other folks, there's a need by companies and corporations who are feeling the weight of additional cost to join us in this effort. And I just want -- this is obviously something that needs to get dealt with. The escalating costs are having a significant impact not just on our economy, but on the ability of people to get hired, or, frankly, people who are hired leave their job because the cost of healthcare is not allowing especially people in the small- and medium-sized businesses to keep up with those costs.\nWith that, thank you guys very much. I look forward to seeing you --\nQ: -- meeting tomorrow -- congressmen coming to the meeting with the President.\nMR. SPICER: We'll have a readout --\nQ: Sean, I have that unrelated question, which was --\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry. That's not fair. Mike gets his unrelated question.\nQ: And answer mine after that, please.\nQ: Will the Trump administration continue the Obama administration's practice of releasing publicly the visitor logs?\nMR. SPICER: We're currently evaluating our procedures on that and we'll have some -- and when we have an announcement I'll let you know.\nAnd, April, I'll have a readout on our schedule for tomorrow later.\nQ: He's meeting tomorrow with --\nMR. SPICER: Once it's confirmed, I will let you know first, and then everybody else.\nThank you, guys. Have a great day.\nEND 2:54 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 3:34 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123460", "text": "The President. Thank you, everybody, and Mike Pence is going to be here in a few minutes. We miss Mike when he's not around. [Laughter]\nSo I want to thank the Members of the House Deputy Whip team. They're going to be very important over the next number of months. We have a great team, and we're going to have a lot of victories, a lot of wins, but we have a great team.\nTogether, we're going to do incredible things for the great citizens of our country. As I said during my joint address to Congress—and I think you mostly liked that, right? [Laughter]\nRepresentative Kevin P. Brady. We loved that. [Laughter]\nParticipant. Liked it a lot.\nThe President. We're witnessing a renewal of the American spirit, a surge of optimism, and a new national pride, which is sweeping across the land. I see it—there's such spirit, whether it's for the business things we're doing or whatever. It's such spirit that we haven't seen in the country in a long time. Jobs are pouring back. You saw what happened with Exxon, where they just announced a massive jobs program. So we're going to have some fun.\nNow, we have to remember, Obamacare is collapsing and it's in bad shape. And we're going to take action. There's going to be no slowing down. There's going to be no waiting and no more excuses by anybody. We're all now—I can probably say I'm a politician. [Laughter] Okay? I am a politician.\nBut we're going to get it done, and you're the leaders that really will get it done for all of us and for the American people. Obamacare is in very bad shape. I believe that if we wait 2 years, it will totally implode. It's really pretty much imploding now, Steve, when you think. But it will implode and people will be, like, please help us, please help us, and that will be the Democrats asking for help. They already are asking for help in the true sense of the word, because it's a disaster. The insurance companies are fleeing. Some States are up over a hundred percent in costs. The deductibles are through the roof—you don't even get to use it.\nSo we're going to do something that's great, and I'm proud to support the replacement plan, released by the House of Representatives and encouraged by members of both parties. I think really that we're going to have something that's going to be much more understood and much more popular than people can even imagine. It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address—a plan that will lower costs, expand choices, increase competition, and ensure health care access for all Americans.\nThis will be a plan where you can choose your doctor. This will be a plan where you can choose your plan. [Laughter] And you know what the plan is—this is the plan. And we're going to have a tremendous—I think we're going to have a tremendous success. It's a complicated process, but actually it's very simple. It's called good health care.\nSo I want to thank you folks for being with us today, ladies and gentlemen. And we will do something really, really important and really good for the American people. I think it's going to go very quickly. I hope it's going to go very quickly. And as you know, after that, we work on the tax cut. We're going to be planning a major tax cut. I know exactly what we're looking at—most of us know exactly the plan. It's going to put our country in great shape, and we're going to reduce taxes for companies and for people, and I can use the word again—massively. It's going to be a big tax cut, the biggest since Reagan, maybe bigger than Reagan.\nSo I look forward—I really look forward to working on that, but we can't really get to that, unfortunately, because of the way your system works. We can't get to that until we take care of health care. So we'll take care of the health care. I appreciate your great support, and let's get it done.\nThank you. Thank you all. Fantastic. Thank you.\nHouse Majority Whip Stephen J. Scalise. Well, Mr. President, thank you for having our Deputy Whip team to the White House. And thank you for your commitment on following through on what, to most Americans, is probably one of the most important promises that was made not only by you, but by all of us in getting this majority, both in the House and Senate and the White House, and that is rescuing the American people from the failures of Obamacare.\nWe've heard the message for years. We've seen the dramatically skyrocketing costs. You're seeing double-digit increases every year in most parts of the country in health premiums for families. Many families are seeing deductibles that rise above the $10,000 range, which means people don't have access to health care. People don't have the ability to choose their own doctor.\nYou talked about this the other night in just one of the best speeches I've heard from a President standing at that well in the House Chamber, when you addressed the Joint Session and gave an inspirational speech to the country laying out the things that need to happen and that you're going to do to get this country back on track, and to create jobs, and to secure America.\nBut one of the things you talked about is how it's wrong that unelected bureaucrats in Washington have the ability to tell you what you can and can't buy for your family in health care, one of the most personal decisions families make.\nThis bill finally starts the process of not only repealing Obamacare, but also replacing it with reforms that put patients back in charge of their health care decisions, that lower costs for families. Let them actually choose the decisions between them and their doctor, which are so personal.\nAnd so as we start this process, the people in this room, the Chief Deputy Whips are the ones that are going to be working directly with Members to ultimately pass this bill to your desk, so that we can quickly provide that relief from Obamacare to the people of the United States.\nAnd I know we are honored to have our former House colleague and now our Vice President of the United States, who has been involved in this fight from the beginning, as well, Vice President Mike Pence joining us, too.\nThank you, Vice President.\nThe President. Well, thank you very much, Steve. And again, we're going to work quickly. It's a great bill. We're going to have tremendous—I really believe we're going to have tremendous support. I'm already seeing the support—not only in this room, I'm seeing it from everybody. And I'm seeing it from the public. And they want Obamacare over.\nI got elected to a certain extent—I would say, pretty good little chunk, based on the fact—repeal and replace Obamacare. And many of you people are in the same boat. Very important. So let's get it done.\nThank you all very much for being here. Thank you. Okay, thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-03-07", "title": "Remarks During a Meeting on Health Care Reform With Members of the House Deputy Whip Team"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123498", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:37 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER: Good morning. First off, I want to acknowledge, as the President did this morning, that today is International Women's Day. It's also Women's History Month. We're going to be holding several events throughout the month here at the White House to honor and celebrate women and how their vital contributions have and continue to be to our society, our economy, our family and our businesses.\nThe President tweeted this morning about the surge in hiring in the two months that he's been in office. LinkedIn's workforce reports say January and February were the strongest consecutive months for hiring in over a year and a half. A new report from ADP and Moody's showed strong private job growth that is far exceeding market expectations. And just this morning, Samsung confirmed that it's planning a \"major investment\" in U.S. production facilities, directly citing the President's election as an influence in their decision. The initial investment is expected to reach around $300 million.\nWe keep seeing that the wave of optimism in growth in the wake of the President's pledges to help American businesses continues to produce real results for people throughout our nation.\nYesterday I forgot to -- there are a couple of things that I didn't get to yesterday, so let me mention a couple of those. Yesterday afternoon, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, and senior White House staff met with several veteran service organizations -- included in what is commonly referred to as the Big Six -- to discuss the President's commitment to helping our veterans and modernizing our VA. The meeting represented another step in fulfilling the President's promise to the men and women who have served our nation so honorably. I know the President looks forward to personally following up on that meeting with the VSOs.\nAlso last night, the President named several individuals whom he intends to nominate or appoint to key administration posts: Courtney Simmons Elwood, General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency; Noel Francisco, Solicitor General at the Department of Justice; Jeffrey Rosen, Deputy Secretary of Transportation; John J. Sullivan, General Counsel for the Department of Defense; Ajit Pai, member of the Federal Communications Commission; and Tony Sayegh, Jr., the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Treasury.\nExpect further announcements as the week goes on.\nNow, on to the events of the day. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder and president of Emerson Collective, an organization dedicated to removing the barriers that unfortunately prevent some in the world from achieving their full potential. They discussed education and immigration policy, which are two of the areas that Emerson Collective focuses on.\nThen the President held a strategic affairs lunch, focused on infrastructure with leaders in the private sector. Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride. But now, an overbearing, ineffective regular system can keep projects in limbo for years. The President has already started removing the regulatory roadblocks that have been killing projects before they've even begun through his executive actions, streamlining the permitting process and calling for each agency throughout the government to identify regulations that cause undue burden.\nAs the President has said many times, strong public-private partnerships will also be key to revitalizing our country's ruined roads, crumbling bridges and outdated airports. The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers' money on inefficient and misguided projects. By looking at infrastructure from a businessperson's perspective, as the President and these executives do, we can restore respect for the taxpayer dollar and make the best investment.\nThe President was particularly pleased to be holding this meeting now that Secretary of Transportation Chao, EPA Administrator Pruitt, and Energy Secretary Perry are all confirmed and getting to work. In attendance at the lunch, as I mentioned, were Secretary Chao, Secretary Perry, Administrator Pruitt, and then Richard LeFrak, CEO of LeFrak; Steve Roth, the CEO of Vornado Realty Trust; Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management; Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Lynn Scarlett, the managing director of the Nature Conservancy; Tyler Duvall, the partner of McKinsey; and Elon Musk of SpaceX.\nLater this afternoon, the President will meet with Congressman Elijah Cummings to discuss rising prescription drugs prices. I know the President is looking forward to continuing the dialogue that they started a few weeks ago on the phone.\nAt 4:00 o'clock, the President will meet with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Sullivan of Alaska. They're expected to discuss the priorities of the Department of Interior, especially as it pertains to the government-owned lands in Alaska.\nThis evening, the President will meet with conservative leaders about health care. We'll have more details and participants on that meeting a little bit later this afternoon.\nThe President and the Vice President continue to reiterate their support for the House bill on Obamacare repeal and replace, and look forward to working with Congress to institute a new healthcare system. Tonight, the President will have dinner with Senator and Mrs. Cruz.\nAnd finally, a couple of additional administration announcements. Today, the President and the First Lady announced the initial details for the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll taking place on Monday, April 17th. They are honored to continue the traditions of the past while creating new ones that will play a lasting role in the fabric of our nation's history. Tickets to the Easter Egg Roll are free to the public and will be allotted through an online lottery. Further details on the lottery and information on that day will be released later this month. Keep an eye on WhiteHouse.gov for updates on that.\nI'm also pleased to announce -- and a little bit proud -- that Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland will be visiting the White House for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit on March 16th. We'll have further details on that visit, as well as the other foreign leader visits later this week.\nWith that, some questions.\nDavid Smith of The Guardian.\nQ: Hi, Sean. Can I ask about the President's state visit to the UK? Is there timing for that? And what was your reaction to some members of Parliament in Britain saying the President is not welcome? They actually used words like \"racist\" and \"sexist.\" Has that led him to reconsider?\nMR. SPICER: The President, as you know, accepted Her Majesty's invitation when the Prime Minister was here. He looks forward to going over and visiting the United Kingdom. As we have details to share with you further, we will, but there is nothing further at this time.\nCaitlin.\nQ: Does the White House have a reaction to the Iranian vessels coming within 150 yards of a Navy ship over the weekend? Aren't they on notice? And will you offer anything beyond a verbal reaction? And then I have a follow-up question.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. The USNS ship that was in close proximity is obviously something that the President has been made aware of. The President has been very clear that this provocative action is something that won't be tolerated. With that, I would refer you to the Department of Defense, who is monitoring that situation and will talk about the appropriate actions they may take.\nAnd your next one?\nQ: And then, secondly, does he have any plans to revamp the H-1B visa program by the April 1 deadline?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've talked before about immigration as a whole. I think there is the legal part of immigration and then the illegal part of immigration. The President's actions that he's taken in terms of his executive order and other revamping of immigration policy have focused on our border security, keeping our country safe, our people safe. And then, obviously, whether it's H-1B visas or the other one -- spousal visas -- other areas of student visas, I think there is a natural desire to have a full look at -- a comprehensive look at that. He discussed the RAYS Act yesterday with Senators Perdue and Cotton. We'll have more on that coming forward.\nBut I think as the readout mentioned, he was very supportive of their efforts with respect to how we view legal immigration. He mentioned it in his joint address that we're one of only a handful of countries that doesn't use a merit-based system of immigration, and that is something that we need to look at in its totality.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I had two quick questions. Are you aware of any women who work at the White House who are participating in the strikes today? And also, more generally, what is the administration's reaction to this protest? And do you think it's an effective way -- skipping work is an effective way for women to demonstrate their power and significance?\nMR. SPICER: On the first part, I am not aware of any that are not here. I think everyone that I'm aware of has shown up and is working really hard to advance the President's agenda. They're committed to moving this country forward. For those of us who have joined the President throughout government, I think -- but obviously, as the President stated today, we want to recognize the contributions that women make to our businesses, to our families, to our economy, to our society.\nAnd it's a free country. People have the right to express themselves. But I think that we should, on a daily basis -- not just one day a year but 365 days a year -- appreciate the contributions that women make in all of those categories. So it shouldn't be a daily thing, and hopefully we can help fix that a little bit more.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. There seems to be this groundswell of conservative opposition to the healthcare bill that was offered up by leadership in the House of Representatives. You mentioned the President is going to be meeting this evening with conservatives. What is his message to those individuals? Are they members of the Freedom Caucus? Will Senator Rand Paul be there? And can you give a sense about what the President intends to do to turn around that opposition that was quite apparent yesterday?\nMR. SPICER: So a few things on that. One, as I mentioned, we'll have a list of participants later. Two, I think that there has been a lot of -- from business and conservative groups have been very supportive of this, whether it's Americans for Tax Reform, Americans' Taxpayers Union, the Medical Device Manufacturing Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AdvaMed, One Nation Health, Consumer Health Products Association, the Association of -- AMAC, the National Association of Wholesale Distributors, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and others.\nThere's been tremendous support for this. We've had people throughout Washington, D.C going to different associations and groups throughout the day the last couple days talking about the benefits of this. And we're going to continue to do outreach. He met, as you know, yesterday with the House Whip team expressing his unwavering support for the bill and the process that it's about to encounter. He'll mention -- he'll work with these individuals tonight.\nAnd we're going to have a full-court press. Our team throughout the administration on local radio and local television to get that message right to the American people to talk about both the things that we talked about yesterday -- why we have a crisis right now in healthcare and why Obamacare is failing, but then secondly why the solution that the President has worked on with the House is the right one to bring down costs and to reinstitute choice. So that message is going to continue to get delivered both today and for the next several weeks until it passes the House and the Senate and comes back to his desk.\nBut again, one of the important messages that I think those on the conservative side need to understand is, right now, there is an uneven playing field. If you get your insurance through Medicaid, Medicare, through the government, or an employer-based healthcare, you are untaxed, your employer is untaxed. It is those self-employed individuals, those small businesses that are paying the penalty for this.\nAnd that's what I think we have to remember, is that we talk so often on the conservative side and on the Republican side about the importance of entrepreneurship, the importance of small businesses to our economy, and yet they're the ones who suffer right now with an inequity in the tax system. And I think that by leveling that playing field, and by giving them more options and driving down cost, we're actually doing a very conservative thing here by removing the mandate of a government-mandated \"you must buy this program or you will pay a penalty,\" and eliminating choice.\nWe are enacting I think very strong conservative values in healthcare that give all Americans more choice at a lower cost. So I think that should be a very positive message.\nJohn.\nQ: Yes, thank you. As a brand new federal employee I'm sure you're aware --\nMR. SPICER: A current -- welcome back.\nQ: Yes, well, at the moment. I'm sure you and your family are aware that Office of Personnel Management offers a very comprehensive healthcare program called the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: You, anyone in this building, on the Hill, their staff, their family, their friends -- not their friends, their family -- well, maybe who knows -- very generous. It's state of the art. The individuals involved in the healthcare situation right now, the debate, no matter how it plays out, can they really have the kind of sympathy and empathy for individuals who may not benefit nearly as much when they're negotiating this -- all these plans, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: In what respect?\nQ: Well, I mean, you're fine. You're covered.\nMR. SPICER: Sure, but it's unfortunate -- first of all, I'm not fine. Because I think because of Obamacare, premiums on everybody have gone up. Regardless of what you pay, federal employees make a contribution to their healthcare plan as well. And I think that the -- all premiums have increased over the last -- whether you're in an employer-based system or not.\nSo one of the big issues with Obamacare was in order to fix a problem that faced 15 to 20 million people, is that the entire system got shattered, and prices on everybody got ratcheted up. People who were on Medicaid suddenly lost their ability -- so the issue was, is that in an attempt to solve a problem that affected a very specified and defined group of people, we affected the entire healthcare market.\nSo whether or not you get it from an employee or not -- an employer or not -- but to your question, that's part of the issue.\nQ: But --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. Here's the issue -- you're right, you're absolutely right. Right now, if you're a federal employee, and a lot of cases in state, you get to open a book and you get to look at what plan matters to you, what plan is best for you or your family -- how much do you want to pay, how much coverage do you want to have, what's the co-pay you're willing to -- what services or benefits do you want as part of your plan. Absolutely. But the issue is, for so many Americans, they don't have that choice. For a third of the counties in this country, they've got one choice, one. And in a lot of states they've got none, or the exchanges are becoming fewer and fewer, the number of doctors and plans that take Medicaid, fewer and fewer.\nSo to your point, I think actually we're in a unique place, because we get to understand what the average American should get -- that we shouldn't be limited to a specified number of people.\nQ: I appreciate your argument. Very well taken.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nQ: However, I'm going to compare a GS-5 or a GS-9 to a senator or a secretary of one of the agencies. I mean the safety net on those individuals gives them a certain cushion, then they're negotiating. But do they really have that kind of compassion or that kind of empathy for the people who, in fact, may be thrown off the healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: I think that just because somebody has healthcare doesn't mean that they can't empathize with somebody who doesn't.\nWe all have family and friends that are suffering. I mean, that's like saying because I have a job I can't be empathetic to somebody who doesn't have a job. We all have family or friends. It's the same thing when we watch a friend or a family member suffer through a terminal disease, because we have suffered through it doesn't mean that we can't have compassion towards that person or be concerned on how much that bill is costing them. I mean, that's actually in some ways -- depending on the relationship you have with that person -- you can even feel worse. You can feel guilty about how much you have and how you're not able to help that person. I think in many cases that's what drives us is to know that there are options available to some Americans and not others.\nQ: I appreciate your response.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, will you confirm that there is a criminal investigation into this alleged theft of cyber tools from the CIA by WikiLeaks? What can the White House tell us about the situation, particularly the fact that it seems like there's another leak for the intelligence community that's on the scale of Edward Snowden? And can you assure the American people that none of these tools have ever been used against them?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's a couple things in that. Number one, for obvious reasons it is our policy as a government not to confirm the authenticity of any kind of disclosure or hack. That would be highly inappropriate for us.\nBut all of these occurred under the last administration -- that is important. All of these alleged issues. And I think it's interesting to have it asked this way about the damage that could have occurred or what tools could be used in light of what's been going on recently.\nWe've had your own network's correspondent James Rosen had his phones -- multiple phones tapped. Was that appropriate back then?\nI think there's a lot of concern out there about alleged leaks. There's two steps to this. And I think what you saw over the last week in terms of -- this should be a major concern to people in terms of the leaks that are coming out and the desire to get to the bottom of them -- whether or not -- not specifically with respect to the disclosure that you're referring to, but I think the idea that we are having these ongoing disclosures of national security and classified information should be something that everybody is outraged by in this country. This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country, our security, and our well-being.\nAnd you've seen over the last two years, depending on the leak, it depends on the outrage. It's interesting how whenever -- whether the leak occurred under the last administration, you had member after member talking about disclosures that occurred during that last administration, whether it was members of Congress -- Elijah Cummings expressed concern during the last thing -- last administration in terms of the Americans that were -- when it dealt with Hillary Clinton, there was complete outrage about the leaks that occurred; members calling for investigations to the leaks. It's interesting how there is sort of a double standard with when the leaks occur, how much outrage there is.\nAnd so I do think it's important. While I don't want to get into confirming or denying this particular thing, I think it is interesting how different subjects are approached.\nThis one everyone is immediately rushing to, and there should be a lot more coverage of this. This alleged leak should concern every single American in terms of the impact it has on our national security.\nQ: Can I ask something unrelated?\nMR. SPICER: Of course, you can.\nQ: Robin Shahini has been imprisoned in Iran since last October for collaborating with a hostile government -- that government being the United States of America. He's on a hunger strike, apparently his health is suffering. Is the President aware of Mr. Shahini's plight and that of three other Americans who are being held in Iran? And what, if anything, might the President be doing about it?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, so obviously we're aware of the situation. In that particular case, I would refer you to the State Department.\nQ: I wanted to go back to an earlier question. What is the President personally going to be doing in order to sell this healthcare bill? And what's he going to do to convince reticent lawmakers to come along -- people like Rand Paul, who don't like it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, we're on day two. As I mentioned, we've been out and local -- talk radio and local markets. The President yesterday met with the House deputy whips. Today, he's having a series of additional meetings with conservative groups, with others. He's already talked to insurance agents. I mean, we've talked about the lead up to this with the insurance executives, with companies, with various members of the House and the Senate from both parties. He met with governors, attorneys general, I think there's a group of lieutenant governors coming in.\nWe're going to be aggressively going after -- talking about the solution that we have for healthcare, both the need to repeal the current Obamacare system and the need to replace it with something that gives patients the choices and costs that they need. As I mentioned yesterday, and I can't overstate this, there's a difference between having a card and having care. Being told you have coverage and not being able to use it is no good, and that's the thing that I think is really important.\nWhen we get asked the question, so often, how many people are going to be covered, that's not the question that should be asked -- how many people are going to get the care they need? Having coverage with a high deductible and, in some cases -- or not having a plan that allows you to get the coverage you need or afford it, isn't real coverage. It's a card. And I think that's the big difference in the approach that we're taking here. It's how do we get people the affordable care they need; that there's more choice; that more doctors are coming into the system instead of leaving. And that is a big, big difference in the approach that's happening now.\nQ: Will he be going on the road to try to sell it?\nMR. SPICER: I think you will see a lot of travel and a lot of activity by the President and all of the administration. And it's not just going to be the President. It's going to be the secretary, the directors, key administration staff. The Vice President has been actively engaged in meeting on the Hill, on talk radio, on local radio, on local television. You've seen a flurry of meetings with outside interests, with op-eds explaining the problem and engaging groups and associations that have an interest in this, and industry leaders.\nBut this is going to be a very, very aggressive, comprehensive approach to making sure that every American understands that there is a major problem and that we are here to fix it.\nCecilia.\nQ: Just on WikiLeaks, I want to go back to that -- two parts. Is the President outraged by this?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, again, I don't want to -- the allegations -- he has been very clear about the concern that he has for leaks. This is --\nQ: This one specifically --\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, Cecilia, if I -- I think he is very concerned about the allegations that are out there in terms of what may or may not happen. It is an allegation, it is something that we are not going to confirm at this time. But as you can imagine from the President's previous comments, he is extremely concerned about this, about these allegations, about this -- about the potential that something -- if this were true -- would have on our national security.\nAnd make no mistake about it, I think the President has talked before that anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law. We will go after people who leak classified information. We will prosecute them to the full extent of the law. Playing with our nation's national security is not something that should be taken lightly under this administration.\nQ: Quick follow-up. When it came to the campaign and Hillary Clinton, the President said, \"I love WikiLeaks.\" Does he still feel that way today?\nMR. SPICER: There is a big difference between disclosing Podesta -- John Podesta's gmail accounts about a back and forth, and his undermining of Hillary Clinton, and his thoughts on her on a personal nature, and the leaking of classified information. There is a massive, massive difference between those two things. And I think it is, again, the interest and the outrage that occurred last year by a lot of Democrats when it came to leaks is interesting that we're hearing not as much outrage now when it comes to some of our issues of national security.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, a couple questions. One, you said Congressman Cummings -- you affirmed Congressman Cummings is meeting with President Trump today.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: In the last press conference, his solo press conference the President had, he talked about Senator Schumer telling Elijah Cummings not to come. What happened to smooth this over? And what is the conversation going to be about? Is it just going to solely be on the high cost of prescription drugs?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that the nature of the meeting stems from the conversation they had on the phone, which was on prescription drugs. And then I'm sure that if Congressman Cummings or the President brings up another subject, it will go there. I'm not -- we'll try to have some sort of readout afterwards, depending on how that goes.\nBut the nature of it is an area where they agree. And if you remember, one of the things that they talked about on the phone was that there were probably several more areas that they would agree on, and find that they would agree on, throughout a conversation. And I hope that that conversation does exactly what they said that it would in terms of getting to those areas of common agreement where they can work together to help solve additional problems that our country faces.\nQ: So you don't have any knowledge of what happened to smooth that over for him to come in --\nMR. SPICER: I know our teams were in touch with -- his office immediately followed. And as you know, there were a couple times when the meetings had been -- tried to be scheduled and just didn't work out. And luckily, he was able to --\nQ: He's one member of the 49 of the CBC. Right after that press conference, the White House reached out to the Congressional Black Caucus, to Cedric Richmond, the head of the caucus. Where is that meeting? Where does that meeting land? Is it happening?\nMR. SPICER: I know that we've reached out, and we're looking for a date on that, as well. So we're pleased that this one was able to come together, and then we'll get to the next one.\nQ: My last question.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Yesterday there was a compare-and-contrast with visuals, show and tell if you will --\nMR. SPICER: Yes, I saw that --\nQ: Yes, you were -- yes. And you compared and contrasted about how you're going about it and how the Obama administration went about Obamacare. One difference that they've made note of -- and I want to get your response to this -- is the fact that you may have this and said that you're doing this versus what they're doing -- the one thing they say that you did not do that they did: had their bill scored by CBO. And you did not score it by CBO.\nMR. SPICER: Sure. It is being scored. Look, I know -- look, with all due respect to them, this the same group that said -- who passed it and then told us we could read it.\nThis bill is online for every American to go to ReadTheBill.gop. It's on the Speaker's website. We link to it on several accounts that we've tweeted.\nQ: But it was scored before they went before the Congress.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And again, if that's the complaint, this is the same group that didn't let anybody read it, that jammed it through with no bipartisan support. This President has reached out to both sides of the aisle, had governors here, had senators here to get their input. There is no contrast between what we did and what they did. This was a full effort to reach out to the members in the House and the Senate. It's going through regular order in the House. Every member of the House and the Senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through -- well, through the committee process and on the floor.\nSo the idea that they can compare the date that they got it scored is pretty reaching deep on this because there has been an opportunity for members to have their input on this and to talk about their concerns, to give their input on it -- especially the governors, who were left on the sideline last time and who have such an important role in administering healthcare when it comes to Medicaid.\nThe idea that anyone talks about when the score was issued -- there will be a score in all good time. But the other thing is, let's be honest, the irony of the score is that the CBO was way off the last time. I don't think that we're waiting to -- that that's a big issue to us right now.\nQ: Doesn't cost matter, though, before you --\nMR. SPICER: Of course, cost matters. But look at how off they were last time. If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place. They were way, way off last time in every aspect of how they scored and projected Obamacare in terms of --\nQ: But you have no numbers --\nMR. SPICER: But neither did they. Last time, if you look at the number of people that they projected would be on Obamacare, they are off by millions. So the idea that we're waiting for a score -- it will be scored. But the idea that that's any kind of authority based on the track record that occurred last time is a little far-fetched.\nJessica.\nQ: Two questions on the wall, Sean. As you know, the bids for prototypes went out today. And I just was curious about the timing of that, how much pressure there was to get that going quickly. And then secondly, is there guidance from the White House about what kinds of vendors can build the wall, especially can international vendors build the wall?\nMR. SPICER: I think that process is working through -- as the President has talked about before, we were trying to move ahead with existing funds that DHS has. And then we'll continue to create a timeline to ask Congress for that funding. We're working with Congress on that.\nAnd then I don't think it will be any surprise to know that the President is going to favor American workers and American companies when it comes to an American project. That shouldn't be any kind of surprise.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, it's looking increasing likely that the Federal Reserve next week will hike interest rates. Two brief questions. One, how does the President feel about that? And secondly, does he have the full confidence in Janet Yellen, who he described during the campaign as \"too political\" to lead the Federal Reserve and set monetary policy?\nMR. SPICER: Let me get back to you on that one. I don't have any comment on the Federal Reserve. I'll look at the team. What I will say is that, as I mentioned at the outset, when you look at the hiring and the jobs and the manufacturing and the pace, the consumer confidence and the CEO indexes that are going -- that have already come out in the first two months, we see a resurgence, an optimism in the economy by job creators to want to hire here, who want to manufacture here, who want to grow here.\nAnd I think that our economy is clearly on the upswing. And I think you see statement after statement, company after company coming out and sharing in the President's vision for moving the country forward and for renewing the optimism and building and being part of an American resurgence in terms of our economy.\nQ: Just to be clear, the no comment was on Mrs. Yellen or on this thoughts of a rate hike?\nMR. SPICER: I'll get back to you on both. How is that?\nYeah, go ahead.\nQ: Sean, along with April's last question about the difference between this administration and the previous one and how to approach this issue, one thing that the Obama administration did do was get key stakeholders at the table -- AARP, American Medical Association. Both of those organizations have come out today strongly opposed to this proposal. What's your message, particularly with respect to the AARP?\nMR. SPICER: Well, they got a really good deal last time when it came to prescription drugs in particular. I think -- this is a patient-centric bill. It's about patients. It's about people. It's about the Americans who were left behind. Look at what those deals got people last time. I mean, for all those people that are on Medicaid, in particular, they don't have choices anymore. So I would argue that the President has put the American people first and has put patients first.\nSo you can talk about -- we're glad to have support, make no mistake about it. But I think that the support that this administration and I think the House is focused on is getting every American their buy-in and their support. Obviously, look, I'm not going to -- we would love to have every group on board. But this isn't going to be -- every single deal we heard about it getting through, \"the Cornhusker Kickback,\" this and that. Over and over again, it was one deal after another to get to -- to buy votes to get it through the Senate.\nSo if you want line up how many special interests got paid off last time versus now, they'll probably win hands down.\nQ: Sean --\nMR. SPICER: This isn't -- hold on -- but this isn't about trying to figure out how many special interests in Washington we can get paid off. It's about making sure that patients get the best deal that lowers prices and brings back costs.\nBut again, I think -- what I'm trying to figure out is at some point you're defending the indefensible. Nancy Pelosi put out three criteria for how they judge Obamacare. And by their own standards, they fail on all three. Costs are up. Choices are down. There is no other way to judge that. By every account, every single premium by every standard is up. Choices are down across the country. So there is a horrible deal that the American people got bought -- got sold. And what we're trying to do is put patients back first in line.\nQ: But so the AARP is specifically talking about patients in their 50s and 60s. The AARP describes this as an \"age tax\" that will disproportionately affect people who right now are low-income, are benefitting from subsidies under Obamacare and could stand -- according to the AARP's estimate -- to take a hit of thousands of dollars in their premium payments this year when the subsidies go away and the tax credits go away. What's your message to those people who voted for the President?\nMR. SPICER: I think that -- right. And the message from the President is that we want you to get more choice and a lower cost. And I think that, as we work this bill through, through daylight -- not jam it through in the middle of the night -- that they are going to see as more and more people will that this is a deal for the American people that's going to put patients first, lower their costs, and give them more choices.\nBut again, I don't -- there is probably not a person out there, either through themselves or a loved one or a friend or a colleague that has seen choices go down and premiums go up [sic]. So what people are dealing with now is not acceptable. And I think the idea that anyone defending the current status quo -- and even in some of the statements of some of the groups, they admit that there's a problem right now.\nAnd so my advice to those people is, join the process. Share your idea, share your thought, let the process work its will so that it is a bill that has input. But the bill -- the way it was done last time is not something that's acceptable.\nShannon.\nQ: Is the President worried, though, that every major doctors group -- the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians -- have all come out and said they have serious concerns? For all the talk of doctors and patients and choice, the doctors groups are all so far unanimously coming and saying they're not supportive of this. Is that concerning to the President?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think when you look at a lot of doctors versus the associations here in Washington, we have had tremendous input from doctors themselves. Dr. Price, himself a doctor, is the one who crafted this.\nSo you have a doctor in charge of the administration's effort to work with Congress. You've got several physicians and other medical professionals in Congress that are talking about the experiences they have -- in fact, many of them ran for Congress because of the concerns they saw in their own industry.\nSo while I have respect for some of the work that some of these Washington, D.C.-based associations do, at the end of the day this is about patients and about the input from doctors who are on the front line of seeing patients and talking about the care that they're able to give or not to give to people.\nAnita.\nQ: Do you mind if I follow up on something else you said?\nMR. SPICER: I do -- I don't, sorry.\nQ: You've talked about people having a card. You've got a card, but it's a $2,000 deductible and there's only 10 doctors in your town that will see you, let's say. But that's better than nothing if you get cancer or hit by a car. So maybe this makes access -- right, but it is better than no insurance. So if this expands access to people and choice, but it reduces the number of people who actually have health insurance --\nMR. SPICER: But I don't think --\nQ: -- so can it do both?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, of course it can. And it will do both, by ensuring that more people -- right now you've got more people paying the penalty and saying, I don't want healthcare, I'm going to pay the penalty because costs are too high. And was it probably five, six, seven years ago, before Obamacare went into place, a single individual, young individual person on the open market could get a premium -- a plan with a premium of 100, 150 bucks a month. It's in the high 300s now.\nAnd I think that there's a big difference. You're not -- for young people just entering the workplace, for example, your example -- they go get into an accident, right now you've got a lot of individuals that get off their parents' healthcare and say, I'm healthy, I have no desire to go get healthcare, it's another few hundred dollars a month that I don't have or that I'd rather spend on something else.\nIf we can get that cost down, it makes a lot more sense -- and get them plans that are tailored to them, 27-, 28-year-old individuals don't need care that's for folks -- that talks about certain things that -- a plan that has certain things that are towards the end of life. But right now, you've got one-size-fits-all, government-run, government-mandated plans that offer people a suite of medical services that they do not need, because there's no choice, and it's a government-mandated system.\nI think offering more choice and more competition allows people to pick a plan that is more tailored to your needs. And this goes back a second ago to what John was asking, that if you can actually pick a plan and across state lines find one that suits you as an individual -- as opposed to maybe there's a family plan that's more comprehensive, it has dental and vision and all the things that your kids are going to need because of all the things you anticipate -- that's a plan that a young family might need versus an older person that's single or a young person that's just entering the workforce.\nBut right now there's no competition, there's no choice. So it's not an either/or situation. We're facing a situation where more and more people are getting less and less and paying more and more for it, and that's the wrong way to go.\nMara.\nQ: Anita. You actually -- Anita.\nMR. SPICER: My apologies. Anita, then Mara.\nQ: Switching gears completely, the military have recently conducted some kind of exercise at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, and it was preparing for a migrant crisis. And there is a DHS migrant center there. And I wondered if the administration has considered, and what you all think about using that facility for immigrants. Has that come up?\nMR. SPICER: That particular exercise, to the best of my knowledge, is a rather regular exercise that occurs, as do many of the exercises that the military prepares for on a whole host of contingency operations.\nSo that is a routine military operation.\nQ: Is there any consideration, though?\nMR. SPICER: It is a routine military operation, as several of them do with our partners throughout the world where we plan for random contingencies that may or may not happen. That's the job of the military -- to practice for contingencies that may or may not happen on a whole host of issues.\nBut to try to ascertain --\nQ: Okay, so are you all considering using the facility for immigrants?\nMR. SPICER: There is nothing to consider it for. I think we're fine right now. There is nothing that we would need to use it for.\nBut again, I mean, I think part of the goal of preparing the military going through various exercises is on a whole host of issues -- on refugees, they prepare for natural disasters. We're not anticipating a natural disaster, but we prepare for them. At the White House, when we were coming in as an administration, I think we briefed during the transition period -- we did what's called a right-seat, left-seat operation with the outgoing administration. So we sat down and talked about cyberattacks and natural disasters, and the whole-of-government response in some of these things.\nIt doesn't mean that we anticipate them, it doesn't mean that we want them, it means that we're going to prepare for them in the same way that many organizations do fire drills. It's not that you anticipate or expect a fire, but you prepare for them, as many families do. Preparedness is the key to executing well, and I think that's what all we're doing.\nQ: And secondarily, the Louisville media is reporting that President Trump will be there on Saturday. Can you confirm that? And is this about healthcare? As you just said, he was going to make the rounds.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I've seen that report. We have nothing to announce with respect to the President's schedule at this time. But, as I mentioned earlier to I think it was Shannon, that we will have -- or is it Jill, I can't -- somewhere in this area -- we will have an update on the President's schedule later this week.\nBut I do anticipate the President to be very active in his support for the repeal-and-replace effort. And so this is what you should expect.\nNow Mara.\nQ: The CBO score is supposed to come out next week, and you just called into question their credibility.\nMR. SPICER: I didn't call into question -- just so we're clear, I'm just --\nQ: It's true.\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, Matt, I appreciate it, I can answer. Their record is what I'm calling into question to -- when you look at the number of people and the costs on what they scored, the last Obamacare bill on, it's way off. That's a fact, that's not anything more than that.\nQ: Well, people base their votes on what they think is going to happen to the cost and the coverage -- if they lose coverage.\nMR. SPICER: That's right.\nQ: Is there any analytic organization that you would accept a score from?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's -- yeah, I mean OMB will probably put out a score on --\nQ: If not the CBO, is there some organization -- so OMB is the --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I'm not saying -- but, Mara, hold on. All I'm saying is, look at what the CBO's record is on Obamacare. It's vastly off. I think they projected 20 million people to be on Obamacare this year; I believe the number is 12. They're way off in terms of the millions.\nSo it's not a question of whether I'm questioning anything -- anyone that can actually do basic math can understand that their projections for Obamacare the last time were way, way off the mark. And so my only point is, is that I think when they come out with this score, we need to understand the track record when it comes to healthcare.\nQ: -- the track record? Is there any scoring organization that you think has a good track record?\nMR. SPICER: There's probably a lot. And I think members have to look at a lot of things to cast their vote on. They're going to have to look at the totality of the bill, the support of their constituents, the current state of things. I think that there's no question -- look, when you look at the trajectory of the cost right now in terms of premiums, you can either say -- and not just the premiums, but Obamacare is going to collapse on its own weight very soon. And the President made it very clear in his press conference and a lot of previous statements, the politically easy thing to do is just let it collapse and let Democrats come back to the table.\nI don't think that's the right thing, and the President has made it clear he doesn't think that's the right thing. This is an opportunity for him to show the American people that the right thing to do is to care about their healthcare options and the cost that they're paying.\nQ: And just one last thing. He mentioned deductibles before and how they're going up under Obamacare. Are you promising people that their deductibles will come down under this plan?\nMR. SPICER: Everything that we have been led to believe about how this is -- yes, this will drive costs down. When you talk about opening up pooling, when you talk about driving costs down because you can buy it over state lines, everything that has driven up costs, all of those market forces that will come in, and I think every leading economist that has looked at this says it will drive costs down.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The premier argument by Democrats, notably former President Obama today, is that enactment of the act that was illustrated yesterday would lead to many people losing their healthcare. You certainly heard that from Democrats, but also several of the Republican governors who were here for the National Governors Association, including strong allies of the President -- Governor Bentley of Alabama, Governor Hutchinson of Arkansas voiced the same concern. They did not want any plan that would lead to anyone losing their present healthcare. What does the administration say to what is the leading argument against a new plan? And then I have a follow-up question.\nMR. SPICER: Of course. I would say that any governor that is concerned about people losing care right now should join us. They are losing their care right now, they are losing their options, and they are paying too much. So the answer is that, if you're concerned about those principles, then you should be concerned with what is happening right now, and you should be concerned and want to join in this administration and work with this Congress.\nAnd again, the big difference that's here is, instead of us jamming a bill down Congress, and now allowing the American people to read it until it is passed, as was done with Obamacare with then-Speaker Pelosi, is that this bill is out in the open for every single person in the world to read. It is open for people to let their member of Congress share their thoughts, share their ideas, and it's done out in the open.\nI think that is a vastly different approach with how this is going about than the last time, and that makes a big difference with the approach. And it gives people an opportunity through the process, what they call regular order, to have input on this. And if it can be made better, then great.\nBut I think this time, we recognized that there's a lot of work that needs to get done on behalf of the patients that are having trouble getting care.\nAlexis.\nQ: Oh, wait.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry.\nQ: My follow-up question is a follow-up question about the wall. During the recent Governors Association meeting, Governor Graco Ramirez, who is the Chairman of Mexico's Association of Federated Governors, warned that continued discussion about the wall and the President's talk of building it might very well lead to the election of Mr. Lopez Obrador as the President of Mexico, and he is considered the most anti-American, most hostile-to-America of any of the candidates. Are there any concerns that come up in the discussion of the wall, namely the impact on Mexican politics?\nMR. SPICER: No. (Laughter.) That was pretty good. The President's number-one concern is the safety of our country. Number two is the jobs that are impacted by this and the ability of Americans to get the wage that they deserve.\nBut again, this is a national security issue, something that, frankly, when he's discussed this with President Peсa Nieto of Mexico, that -- there is a shared concern about drug cartels, drug trafficking, arms sales over the border. There is a shared concern for the respect of the border, because it means a lot to both sides.\nSo this is something that we care about from a national security standpoint, and then obviously the President is concerned on it both -- as well as on an economic standpoint.\nAlexis.\nQ: I want to follow up on what John was just -- your answer was that if the healthcare bill could be made better, the President is interested in that. So could I just clarify, when he meets with the congressional conservatives this evening who have misgivings about the legislation, is he intending to talk to them about what they would like to change, and is he open to making those changes? Is that what he -- is that the mode he's in, rather than a sell mode? He's in a listening mode?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's in a -- very much of a sell mode. The President and his team have worked very hard on this. They're very proud of the effort and the product that they have produced in consultation with the House and the Senate.\nBut obviously, it's going through the process. And so if somebody has an idea -- and that could be on the administration's side -- that we believe that after a consultation with individuals or groups, that there's a way to improve upon this -- but that's the beauty of going through the process that we are.\nBut make no mistake, the President is very proud of the product that we have produced. We are out in full sell mode all around the country talking about how we think this is the best way to solve the problem that the American people face, and why we believe that the solutions that we put forward in this bill are the right ones, and that will benefit them.\nGo ahead.\nQ: And can I follow up and say -- before the President meets with Chancellor Merkel next week, is it possible that we could see the President for a more general multi-question news conference? He's been a little press-shy this week. And from North Korea to healthcare selling to CIA leaks, we'd love to talk to him. Could we see him for a news conference?\nMR. SPICER: I will ask, Alexis. (Laughter.)\nQ: Would you ask him that? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Is there anyone else? I would be glad to ask -- show of hands. (Laughter.) Okay, thank you, I appreciate it. I would be glad to ask the President, share your request with him, and I'll see what we can do on his schedule. But as you can -- he is very busy these days. He has done a lot of sprays, he will continue to interact with you guys. But I will be glad to make your request known.\nKatie.\nQ: Sean, yesterday Secretary Price said that the bill that you guys have introduced, both the repeal and the replace, are starting points. And on Capitol Hill there was a lot of talk of the starting point being a nonstarter. So it seems like there's negotiations that need to be made. Does the President have any non-negotiables in his bill that he will not take out, even at the request of conservatives?\nMR. SPICER: Well, Katie, I mean, I think, as I was just saying to Alexis, that it is a starting point. It's going through regular order in the House. And so part of that process as it goes through the committee markup hearing, both in Ways and Means and House Energy and Commerce Committee -- that by its very nature allows for input through both of those committees and then ultimately on the floor before it moves over to the Senate, and the Senate goes through a similar process.\nSo I think, frankly, we're just acknowledging the reality of where the process is. But we're proud of the process, we're proud of the input that we've received from governors, from senators, from individuals, associations, companies. And we feel very proud of the work that is encapsulated in this bill, and the results that it will yield.\nAnd so that being said, I think the President understands, as a businessman, that if someone's got a really good idea that he's going to listen to it. And if he can be part of the process to help make something better, there's nothing that's going to preclude that. We have been very open to listening to people. We're very proud of that. We're going to go out, as I said, in full sell mode. But if there's an idea that comes across, we're going to entertain that to make it clear.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, two topics here. First on healthcare, then I'll have a follow-up on that. In the past, you and others have accused Democrats of rushing through the original healthcare law. Now, there are some Republicans, including today, who say this is simply moving too fast. Is the President willing to accept a delayed timeline if it pushes repeal and replace into later in the year?\nMR. SPICER: Going through the process can't be delayed -- I mean, by its very nature. We're going through the committee process. There are two House committees --\nQ: But you said the timeline is being -- maybe Easter break -- after that --\nMR. SPICER: But again, that's subject -- right, but again, I would argue it's subject to how the House does its will and then how the Senate does. I think obviously we would like this to move forward. There's a lot of stuff in the queue. We've talked about tax reform. This bill is attached to the FY17 budget reconciliation, and I know that, for a lot of Americans, that means nothing in terms of the phrase and the nomenclature that surrounds how Congress does it.\nBut it's important to recognize that that vehicle allows Congress to do certain things and not others with a 50-vote -- with a majority vote in the Senate. That's important. There are certain things you can do through that, that you can't do through other vehicles, and that will take a 60 vote and -- that you can do administratively.\nSo it's actually -- if you heard Dr. Price talk yesterday about the three phases, it's actually multi-phased, it's going through regular order. But there is simply no contrast between how we are approaching this and how Democrats approached it last time.\nNumber one, there's actually been input from across the aisle, both from the governors who were here, attorneys general, outside groups, House and Senate Democrats have been able to provide input to both staff, to the senior administration officials and to the President. And then secondly, it's actually going through the process.\nSo while we can predict a timeline, ultimately, it's going to be up to the House and then the Senate to determine how fast it goes. But there are members on each of those committees, and then, ultimately, every member on the floor that has the ability to give input.\nQ: Just one other question. I'm just curious about this meeting with Senator Cruz tonight. He has come out and expressed some skepticism on the bill as it stands now. Presumably that will be part of the topic of conversation, but as you mentioned, Heidi Cruz is coming too, and I'm wondering if the President has any plans to apologize to her for the insinuations he made on the campaign trail.\nMR. SPICER: I think they're looking forward to a great dinner. He had dinner with the Rubios a couple of days ago, maybe a week ago. He had lunch yesterday with Senator Graham. As I stated weeks ago, the President is going to continue to have outreach to members of Congress of both parties. He's meeting with Congressman Cummings today.\nThis is a President who wants to engage with members of both sides of the aisle in both Houses, but also groups, business leaders, union leaders, the AFL-CIO head, Richard Trumka, was here yesterday. This is a President that's going to engage with everybody that can help join in proposing ideas and thoughts and opinions on how to move the country forward.\nSo he looks forward to dinner tonight with Senator and Mrs. Cruz, as he has with several others. And I think you're going to see more -- a continuation of this kind of effort to reach out and get people's ideas.\nMargaret.\nQ: And then -- I apologize, I have a second topic, which is, does the President believe the CIA has been compromised in any way?\nMR. SPICER: With respect to the disclosure, is that what you're --\nQ: yeah.\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to -- it's U.S. government policy not to confirm this. I think he has obviously been very concerned, as I stated, about the disclosure of national security on any level. It undermines our country's national security. And I think that -- I just will say, I think there's also been a big double standard when it comes to disclosures of classified information and the outrage that exists when one side has it happens versus another.\nQ: What do you mean?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that there has been a lot of disclosures about national security that occurred last cycle when there was potential that the FBI had leaked certain information. The members of Congress on the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton, and others talked about how there was so much concern about classified information -- we're seeing such silence and outrage from the media, from others with the current disclosures now with things that may or may not have happened towards the 2016 election when it comes to this side.\nSo I think there's a vast difference when it comes to how the disclosures are approached.\nYeah.\nQ: Sean, on North Korea, what is President Trump's position toward North Korea, and what is his decision for the North Korean policy?\nMR. SPICER: On the which --\nQ: North Korean policy.\nMR. SPICER: On the politics?\nQ: No, policy.\nQ: Policies.\nMR. SPICER: Oh, policies. Well, I mean, we're very troubled by the launch of missiles that have occurred from North Korea. I think that's why the THAAD missile system that we've started to deploy into South Korea is so important. We're continuing to work with the government of South Korea to make sure that they have the defenses necessary to protect themselves.\nThe deployment of a THAAD system is critical to their protection, as witnessed by this weekend's ballistic missile test. China and the United States in particular both understand the threat that North Korea poses to the region. And I think that there's areas of concern that we can work together to protect the country.\nTrey.\nQ: You had called on me.\nQ: Today was International Women's Day. There's a lot of concern about access to healthcare for women. Will the President commit to reaching out to female Democratic lawmakers as the next two phases of this healthcare bill continue? And additionally, what is the President's stance on access to birth control for women across the country?\nMR. SPICER: I think that question was asked and answered by Secretary Price yesterday. With respect to women's health, the President has also made it clear that he intends to have a substantial increase in funding towards women community centers that fund women's health services. And that will be reflected in his budget.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: Sorry.\nQ: Sean, is the President the target of a counter-intelligence investigation?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's what we need to find out. There's obviously a lot of concern. I mean, I mentioned to John there was considerable concern last cycle when a reporter was the target of one. But part of the reason that we have asked the House and the Senate to look into this is because of that.\nAnd I think it was interesting. I think if you look at last week, all of a sudden these stories that keep coming out about the President and his links to Russia, it has continued to be the same old, same old, played over and over again. The President has made clear he has no interest in Russia, and yet a lot of these stories that come out with respect to that are, frankly, fake.\nThey are a series of fake allegations that at the bottom note, \"While there's no evidence to substantiate any of this,\" it's the same unnamed sources, \"associates\" that we get tagged with, and yet there is no evidence that continues to be shown. And every single person that gets briefed on this shows that -- whether it's Senator Cotton, Chairman Nunes, who has done a phenomenal job of trying to get to the bottom of this.\nBut it's interesting, I think the double standard that exists between the concern about getting to the bottom of the allegations that -- with respect to the President, that there are so many other issues. When you talk about --\nQ: So he doesn't know whether he is the target of a probing?\nMR. SPICER: But I think that's one of the issues that we have asked the Senate and House to look into.\nI can tell you with respect to the other instances, you look at former DNI Clapper's comments, he literally said, the DNI -- he said, \"The DNI, which includes the NSA, FBI and CIA, did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents.\" Senators Rubio, Cotton, Burr, Chairman Nunes -- all of the people who have been briefed on this situation have come to the same conclusion.\nAnd it is interesting how many times this fake narrative gets repeated over and over and over again, and yet no evidence has ever been suggested that shows the President has anything to do with any of the things that are written. It's a recycled story over and over and over again. And I think that there's a bit of -- it's amazing, the President goes out last week, does this joint session, and then literally 24 hours, stories start getting recycled about potential issues that come up that literally continue to offer no fact, nothing but the unsubstantiated rumors over and over again.\nAnd yet, what is ignored is when you have someone like former DNI Clapper go out and literally say that they \"did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and [Russian] agents.\" You have Rubio, Cotton, Nunes all say the same thing that they've been briefed that there's nothing -- and yet this fake narrative --\nQ: Sorry, just want to make sure that I'm understanding you. Are you saying that there is a possibility he is the target of a counter-intelligence probe involving Russia? Because you just connected those two things.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think what I'm saying is that there is a difference between that narrative and then the narrative that has been perpetuated over and over again.\nThe concern that the President has and why he asked the Senate and House intelligence committees to look into this is to get to the bottom of what may or may not have occurred during the 2016 election. But the interesting -- Margaret, is that when you look at every single person that's been briefed, they've all come to the same conclusion -- that nothing happened during the 2016 election tying him to Russia. And yet the fake narrative continues over and over and over again, and the idea that it has to -- it continues to be recycled without any substance, without any evidence, needs to stop.\nYes.\nQ: The President said he was tapped.\nQ: He said his wires were tapped.\nQ: He said this as a fact.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and that's why we're --\nQ: So you're saying he doesn't know whether he was wiretapped?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, that's not what I said was --\nQ: Well, he doesn't know he's the target of an investigation.\nQ: That his wires were tapped.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, one at a time. I said that the President made clear on Sunday that he has asked the House and the Senate intelligence committees to use their resources and their processes to examine the facts and come to a conclusion.\nChris.\nQ: Since you're talking about whether things are true or not, let me ask you -- following up on something yesterday, you seemed to acknowledge that the President was wrong when he tweeted that 122 prisoners released by the Obama administration from Gitmo had returned to the battlefield. In fact, it was mostly by the Bush administration. Will he retract, or even apologize for that, given that he also called it a \"terrible decision\" by the Obama administration, and given that that was incorrect? That there still has been no proof either of his tweets about widespread voter fraud or the wiretapping? Does the President have a credibility problem?\nMR. SPICER: No, look, I said yesterday -- I think Trey asked the question -- that the President meant the total number of people.\nQ: But he said the Obama administration.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, I'm actually explaining it. That's why you asked the question. He meant that the total number of people released from Gitmo was 122. What the President -- but just to be clear, there's a big difference -- under the Bush administration, most of those were court ordered. The Obama administration took great steps -- they talked about -- it was a campaign promise, frankly, from day one to close Gitmo. This President is very clear that he understands the nature of the threat that the people in Gitmo pose to our nation, and the recidivism rate that there are among people that we have released.\nThat is a concern that he shares. The reason the Bush administration did it was in many cases they were under court order. The Obama administration made it actually a priority to let people go and to actively desire to close that camp and to release more and more of those people, especially in the waning days. There is a huge contrast between the posture and the policy of the last two administrations on how they were dealing with Gitmo.\nThis administration understands and the President has been very clear that he understands the people that are kept in Gitmo pose a danger to our country and to the rest of the world. There's a big, big difference between the posture of those two.\nQ: Do you acknowledge that the tweet was wrong?\nMR. SPICER: I just said it. I said that the tweet -- he meant that it was -- the totality of the people. That's what I said to Trey yesterday, I'll say it again to you today.\nDave Boyer.\nQ: So can I just follow up on something else you said, Sean? A totally different topic, because you said that you're in full -- you're in sell mode, completely in sell mode. And I wonder if the President sees this as a test of his ability to make a deal, something that he really talked about, something that voters responded to on the campaign trail. Is this essentially, does he feel, on him that this is him going to show the American people that he can get this deal done?\nMR. SPICER: Well, he gets -- he is a dealmaker. He's a negotiator. He's a world-class business leader. And he's been highly successful at it. So if anybody can get a deal on something, it's going to be Donald Trump. That's part of the reason I think that the American people -- what they saw in him, that there was so much broken with Washington that when it came to the big problems -- whether it was domestically or internationally -- that if somebody could come in and work across party lines, work with another country to get a deal that was in the country's best interest, he had that skillset. And that's why they, frankly, elected him President.\nSo I think he feels very good about the product that we've put out. We are in sell mode. We want to get this done. But the President has an open mind. He enjoys meeting with people and hearing ideas about how to make this country better, how to create jobs, how to create a better healthcare system, how to create better schools. And if there's someone that comes up with a better idea that will help lower costs and increase access, he's certainly going to listen to it.\nDave Boyer.\nQ: Sean, yesterday in the President's meeting with the deputy whips he was talking about his tax cut plan. He said it's going to be the biggest since Ronald Reagan, maybe even bigger. He said, \"I know exactly what we're looking at, most of us know exactly the plan.\" So my first question is really easy. Tell us about the plan.\nMR. SPICER: What the plan is?\nQ: The tax cut plan.\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I'm going to wait until -- thank you, I appreciate the layup, Dave. (Laughter.) But I'll leave it to him to work with Congress. When we're ready to roll it out, we will do just that. We're not there yet, so let's go on with the next hopefully --\nQ: Secondly, building on these jobs numbers today that look very positive, obviously there's a lot of CEOs out there who are excited about the possibility of a tax cut plan, and yet the President has also expressed a lot of concern about the national debt. If you're going to get a tax cut on the level of Ronald Reagan, a historic-sized tax cut, how are you going to do that, balance the needs for continued job growth with the concerns about the debt?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think that one of the best ways to get the national debt down is to grow the economy. The more the economy is growing, the more we can get it at three, four, five percent, the more the deficit goes down. That's just the best way to tackle the deficit is to grow the economy, put people back to work, create a deeper manufacturing base. I mean, that is -- between that and some of the efforts that the President has put in to make government more efficient and effective, and save money at that level, those are the two things that I think combine to get the deficit down.\nJennifer.\nMR. SPICER: Hi, Sean. Of the more than 13,000 Syrian refugees who are in this country, less than 150 of them are Christian, Shia, or Yazidis -- the same groups that the U.S. government acknowledges are literally being at risk of being wiped off the map. So I wonder, now that Secretary Tillerson has had time to settle in and as you review the refugee program, immigration policy, is this something that's being discussed? Is this a priority to give these groups some relief?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that you know that when we talked the first time about the executive order, it was something that we acknowledged. There is definitely an area where -- in the executive order that we just passed, one of the areas that we talked about was -- and I'd have to go back and look at the exact phraseology, but we recognize that certain groups, and they can be religious in nature, are being persecuted, and I think that that's going to be a factor on how we look at that program.\nIt's something that the President, as you mentioned, he's talked about in the past. It's something that Secretary Tillerson has acknowledged. And that's not just refugees coming into this country, but I think one of the reasons that we need safe havens in Syria is to make sure that groups and individuals, whether they be part of a group or religion who are being persecuted have a degree of safety that they can count on.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Appreciate it --\nMR. SPICER: No, no.\nQ: Mike, Maria.\nQ: Right here, thank you.\nMR. SPICER: It's International Women's Day, Mike.\nQ: Exactly. Thank you so much. So the President is on the record saying that he supports some sort of legalization for many of the undocumented people in the country. And you know there's a DREAMer that was caught in the raids in Seattle, Washington. We don't know if he is going to be released or not. Does the President want to or plan to meet with DREAMers to talk about what's on his mind about gathering ideas for some sort of legalization? And if so, when would that meeting occur?\nMR. SPICER: The President, I think, has talked about how he wants to tackle this holistically, and back to Chris's question a second ago, I think he has made clear that if there's someone who has the ability to strike a deal, to get people in a room and acknowledge well, we have to stay true to our principles, that we can get a deal on a way to fix our broken immigration problem, it is him.\nWe are not at that phase yet. This is something that he has talked to senators about, and I think that, as we continue to move forward, obviously, the focus now is on Obamacare, repealing and replacing it with this program. But it is something that we're going to continue to move forward with, and as a comprehensive thing -- not just the illegal issue, but the visa issue, how we deal with the other folks that are in this country. But stay tuned, we've got more to go on this. We'll go further.\nWhat's that?\nQ: No meeting on the works with DREAMers?\nMR. SPICER: There is nothing on the schedule at this point.\nQ: I'm sure you're aware of reports that the President had ordered the Pentagon to step up the attacks on al Qaeda in Yemen. Does this mark a new strategy rather? And does the President delegate now to the Pentagon attacks on either ISIS or al Qaeda?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President talked about this a lot during the campaign, about giving the authority and trusting the generals and the decision-makers of his national security team with executing what they need to, to prosecute the war on terror and the war against radical Islamic terrorism.\nSo it's not a question of delegating authority. There are certain things -- and we addressed this in the briefing in previous weeks -- but there's a big difference. He's not delegating the authority, but making sure that they have the ability and the timeliness to act in an appropriate manner to prosecute the case and to go after terrorists in a way that they probably weren't last time.\nSo I mean, there is a big difference between the approach of this President and the last administration in terms of giving the generals and the leaders in the national security team and the Defense Department the tools and authority they need to prosecute the case against ISIS.\nSarah. Gabby, sorry.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You'll get it one day.\nMR. SPICER: I know. You guys switch.\nQ: Israel's defense minister said yesterday that U.S. officials had sent a direct warning to Prime Minister Netanyahu against annexing parts of the West Bank. I wanted to know if that was at the request of President Trump. And then also, if you could tell us where the White House is in terms of reaching a deal with Israel on what they consider permissible settlement construction.\nMR. SPICER: Well, as you know, yesterday, the President spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu. That conversation largely had to deal with areas of regional security. I don't have anything further to readout on that, and I know that when they met here at the White House, there was discussion of settlements, and the President was very clear about what his desires and his wishes were. I think as we continue to follow up with Israel in the coming weeks, we will have more on that.\nQ: Thank you. Ronica Cleary with Fox 5. I have a follow-up question to actually his asking about the thousands of women who have chosen to strike today, and you saying that it is a free country. But at Channel 5, we've reported quite a bit on the schools and the districts that are closing because so many women chose to strike today.\nSo it is a free country, but what would be the President's reaction to, if you will, what is more important; the students being at school today or the woman's right to strike and kind of make a statement, if you will, on this day?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, thanks, Ronica. I think it's an important question. I mean, you've -- I know, locally, this affects a lot of individuals throughout Northern Virginia and Maryland and the District. So look, I think -- I haven't talked to the President specifically about this. Obviously, as I mentioned, people have a right to express themselves under our First Amendment, as the President is doing today by making sure that we appropriately salute the contributions that women make to this country.\nBut there's clearly an impact in the case of schools -- localities throughout the country, here in the greater Washington, D.C. area. But I think that that concern is best utilized by parents through their local school boards and through their city councils and mayors, whether or not they found it appropriate for that to occur. I have not spoken to the President about this, but I think there's a balance. And I think that -- I would hope that we should use this opportunity to recognize the role of women in the workplace, in the family, and throughout society for the contributions that they continue to make and have made in the past in making the country as great as it has.\nSo with that, one last thing, just to clarify. I think Jill asked this, but I just want to be really clear on one point, which is, there is no reason that we should -- that we have to think that the President is the target of any investigation whatsoever. I'm sorry, that was Margaret. I apologize.\nQ: Specifically counterintelligence.\nMR. SPICER: Right, and there is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation. I think that's a very important point to make, and so --\nQ: So retract your previous --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. It doesn't -- what I'm saying is -- hold on. The one question dealt with whether or not the tweet dealt with wiretaps during the thing, the other is an investigation. They are two separate issues, and there is no reason to believe that there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice.\nThank you, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. See you guys --\nQ: -- leaks?\nMR. SPICER: Not that -- I can't comment. Thank you, guys.\nEND 2:50 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-03-08", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

Throughout our history, women have made enormous contributions in the service of our country, and we know that as a Nation, America will only become stronger, more prosperous, and better able to meet our shared goals, as women achieve greater access to a level playing field.\nThe United States, as a beacon of hope and a leader in promoting women's rights, is deeply committed to empowering women both at home and abroad. Our policies will work to advance the economic empowerment of women by promoting entrepreneurship and equal access to education, employment opportunities, and training adapted to a new economic landscape.\nTogether, America looks forward to a bright future with women in higher-wage jobs throughout high-growth sectors. America remains committed to empowering women around the world to realize their full potential within the global marketplace. And with our international partners, America will build upon the legacy of previous generations of women who have bravely broken through both economic and political barriers.\nIt was with these goals in mind that, as one of its first initiatives, this Administration ramped up efforts to promote women in business by launching the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. The United States will continue to work with Canada and other partners around the globe to ensure that all women have the opportunity to succeed.\nToday, the United States renews its commitment to fostering economic growth and job creation by harnessing the full potential of women in our economy. This Administration will work diligently to encourage women to enter and succeed in the workforce while addressing the many barriers women still face in achieving economic success, including those that impede women's access to capital, markets, and networking opportunities.", "timestamp": "2017-03-08", "title": "Statement by the Press Secretary in Honor of International Women's Day"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123497", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:04 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER: Good morning, everyone.\nQ: Afternoon.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. Appreciate the -- John Roberts fact-checking from the seat. (Laughter.) Good morning -- good afternoon. (Laughter.) It's not my fault, it's on the paper.\nAfter receiving his daily intelligence briefing this morning, the President led a National Economic Council listening session with CEOs of small and community banks. Since 2008, the number of small banks has declined 30 percent. The dramatic increase in regulation following the financial crisis has been a major driving force in the decline of these banks. Dodd-Frank alone has resulted in 22,000 pages of new regulations.\nWhile large banks can hire armies of compliance officers whose sole purpose it is to ensure they meet the ever-growing number of regulations, it increases the cost of doing business for community banks, leading some not to engage in some forms of lending, or simply due to the time and costs involved.\nOur community banks are key funding sources for small-business owners, entrepreneurs, farmers and ranchers across the country, many of whom can't qualify for traditional loans. They provide approximately half of all loans to small businesses. By reforming the regulatory system so that it is efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored, we will stop treating these critical institutions in our communities the same as banks that have exponentially more in assets, enabling them to engage even more with small businesses and entrepreneurs that stimulate local economies.\nThe banks participating in this listening session are members of the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America. A full participant list is available to those who are interested.\nYesterday I noted the continued signs of good news in our economy in terms of hiring, and the morning reports showed that consumer comfort has risen to the highest level in a decade. I'm sure last night you also saw the report that illegal southwest border crossings are down by an extraordinary 40 percent, a significant deviation even when you consider the seasonal trends. These measures reflect that both the economy and the border are already responding to the President's agenda, even while we're still in the beginning stages of putting his policies in place.\nThe country and the world are clearly ready and waiting for the change that the President campaigned on and is already delivering. Right now, the President is holding a legislative affairs lunch with OMB Director Mulvaney and key members of Congress on his plans for the federal budget and repeal and replace that we've talked about.\nThis is just the latest opportunity to continue the dialogue between the President and members on Capitol Hill on turning his ambitious agenda into action. The strong relationship between President and congressional leaders will be key as the budget process moves along. As Director Mulvaney has been saying, our budget blueprint will be released in mid-March, and the President is working collaboratively with both his Cabinet and Congress to create a budget that keeps the President's promises to secure the country and make the most efficient use of taxpayer money.\nIn attendance at the meeting from Capitol Hill are Senator Crapo, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman Cochran; the Senate Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; Senator Mike Enzi, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee; Senator Bob Corker of the Senate -- member of the Senate Budget Committee; Congresswoman Black, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee; Congressman Thornberry, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio; Congressman Meadows of North Carolina; the Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus; and Congressman Rokita of Indiana.\nLater this afternoon, the President will meet with former Secretary of Commerce Pete Peterson. Then the President has a meeting with Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly and the Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo.\nAnd finally, the President will make remarks to the Senate Youth Program around 4:00 today, a tradition that began with President Kennedy and has continued through every administration. The President is honored to be speaking to this distinguished group of young men and women who are interested in pursuing careers in public service.\nI also want to mention that right about now, the Vice President is giving the keynote remarks at the Latino Coalition's Policy Summit. His remarks focus on the particularly negative impact of Obamacare on small businesses, many of who have been unable to hire more workers, or were forced to scale down their operation due to high taxes and burdensome requirements that were imposed by the law.\nThe President is dedicated to improving the healthcare system for every American, including small businesses owners who have especially been suffered -- have had to suffer through complying with thousands of pages of regulations and rules. That's exactly why he's working with Congress to enact the American Health Care Act, which he was glad to wake up this morning and see approved by the House Ways and Means Committee.\nAlso today, the President was pleased to see his Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, voted out of committee. We had hoped to see Seema Verma, who would be confirmed as the administrator this week as the administrator of Health Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats continue to unnecessarily delay her confirmation. At this critical time when we're talking about healthcare, it's ironic that they refuse to consider someone with such amazing expertise in this area.\nSeema Burma has worked for over 20 years in healthcare policy. She has redesigned Medicaid programs in several states, including Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Kentucky. She's worked with governors' offices, state Medicaid agencies, state health departments, state departments of insurance, as well as private companies and foundations. She's unquestionably and uniquely qualified for her position, and especially now that health reform is at the top of the President's agenda, it's time to get her in place. This delay by Senate Democrats at this critical time is unacceptable.\nOn a scheduling note for the weekend, the Vice President announced yesterday that he'll be in Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday with Governor Bevin. The Vice President's Office will have further details for you on that trip as we get closer.\nFinally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today is the 10-year anniversary of the disappearance of Former FBI Agent Robert Levinson from Kish Island, Iran. The Trump administration remains unwavering in our commitment to locate Mr. Levinson and bring him home. The Levinson family has suffered far too long, and we will not rest until his case is resolved. And with that, I'll take your questions.\nHallie Jackson.\nQ: I got a couple of topics for you, if you don't mind.\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: Julian Assange says the CIA has lost control of its entire cyber weapons arsenal. Does the President agree?\nMR. SPICER: I think, as we've commented before, there's grave concern that the President has about the release of national security and classified information that threatens and undermines our nation's security. Obviously, he believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated. We are not commenting on the current situation, as is U.S. government policy, but I think the situation technology-wise at the CIA, the President has acknowledged, needs to be updated. The CIA put out a statement regarding the current situation, and I would refer you to that.\nQ: Follow-ups on that. Is he going to talk about that with Mike Pompeo today?\nMR. SPICER: He gets a daily briefing from the director, and I'm not privy to the contents of his discussion, but obviously issues of national security, including that, are probably something that gets discussed.\nQ: And then some Republicans have said Julian Assange should be imprisoned. Does the President agree?\nMR. SPICER: I think the U.S. government has had a position on Julian Assange is -- a position in the past, and I don't see anything that has changed that. He has compromised in the past -- and undermined our national security, and I think I'll leave it up to the Department of Justice to further comment on their disposition of him.\nJohn.\nQ: Second topic was on healthcare.\nMR. SPICER: Second topics?\nQ: Second of two topics.\nMR. SPICER: It's like an interview, not a press briefing.\nQ: The President tweeted just a little bit ago that he believes that healthcare is coming along great. We've also been watching Paul Ryan deliver a pretty lengthy PowerPoint presentation --\nMR. SPICER: Very good PowerPoint.\nQ: -- seeming aimed at convincing Republicans to get onboard this plan. Isn't that a sign that healthcare is not actually coming along great?\nMR. SPICER: I think anybody who has been in Washington for a few days or longer recognizes that any major piece of legislation takes a lot of explanation. The President has been very committed to talking to members of Congress. He had another meeting last night. Something as complicated as this, that deals with one-fifth of our economy, that was a major takeover of our healthcare system, isn't a simple thing.\nIt's a major, complicated piece of legislation that's got three prongs to it. And this is the first one -- the reconciliation piece that starts to chip away at finally repealing Obamacare. When they passed Obamacare, they rushed it so quick they gave the then-Secretary of Health and Human Services great authority to enact certain aspects of it. We now -- that would be our phase two, is having Secretary Price go through the pieces of Obamacare that he has been given the authority to, when they passed it, to help unwind a lot of the things they did.\nAnd then phase three is stuff that has to be done through other pieces of legislation that does stuff like allow people to sell insurance across state lines; that allows small businesses to pool. So there's a lot of facets to getting this pushed through, and I think that one of the things that we've been able to do quite effectively is talk to members, especially in the House, but the Vice President has been very active on both sides of both chambers to communicate how this is a comprehensive strategy in three prongs to repeal and replace it with something more effective.\nQ: -- for example, roll back Medicaid expansion freezing until 2018? Would he support that?\nMR. SPICER: Look, Hallie, I think this is going to through the process of -- it's working its way through Ways and Means today, there's a mark-up in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and I think that's where we are going to continue to see action -- in the House, and then when it goes to the Senate the President will continue to engage very actively with the House and the Senate to get this done.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray said in a statement that Donald Trump should keep his hands off women's bodies, women's healthcare, and Planned Parenthood, which has done just fine without President Trump's advice. I wanted to know what the response from the White House was on this.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, with respect to Planned Parenthood specifically, the President has been very clear that he's pro-life. We've worked with them to talk about making sure that there's a difference between taxpayer funding of abortion and women's health services. We have, and the President has committed to making sure that funds for women health community centers is going to be reflected by a substantial increase in his budget. He's committed to doing that, and he's trying to figure out a way to make sure that the focus of taxpayer money is spread towards community centers that provide vital health services to women, and that we're not using taxpayer funds for abortion.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ: I just want to follow on Hallie --\nMR. SPICER: Which one?\nQ: In an unrelated topic. (Laughter.) Just so you're prepared. On healthcare, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas today sent a series of tweets in which he basically said, this is dead on arrival in the Senate, go back to the drawing board, adding that it is absurd for the committees to be voting on something that hasn't even been scored yet. What does the President think of what Senator Cotton said today? Does he plan on having a conversation with him?\nMR. SPICER: Well, we're going to engage. He has talked to Senator Cotton, and will continue to talk to any senator that has questions or concerns or ideas. It went through the Ways and Means Committee last night. I think they started at something like 10:15 yesterday morning. It is an 18 --\nQ: Has he talked --\nMR. SPICER: I don't believe he has talked to Senator Cotton. He's meeting with members right now. As I just mentioned, he had dinner last night with Senator Cruz. He's continuing to work both sides of the aisle, both chambers. As I mentioned yesterday, I think you're going to see a very aggressive, a very robust push. We continue to have the team out talking to local media, local radio, op-eds placed, talking to local leaders.\nWe believe that the more we talk about the comprehensive, three-prong approach that we have to doing a lot of the things that conservatives have talked about -- to bring back cost containment, to get people to be more patient-centered in the healthcare decisions they make, allow more choices -- it's going to bring people on board.\nBut the thing that's really interesting, John, about the current approach is that, no matter where you are, especially on the conservative side, you cannot possibly believe that the current healthcare system is an effective program. It is a monstrosity. It is a government gone wrong. And I think --\nQ: I hear that, but --\nMR. SPICER: And I think that we will continue to engage with him and other members of the House and Senate that have ideas, but it's going to continue to work its way through the process. As I mentioned, it went through the House Ways and Means Committee. It's currently going through the House Energy and Commerce Committee. When the House passes it, and it goes over to the Senate, I'm sure Senator Cotton and other senators will have an opportunity to have their say. That's part of the process. We welcome his ideas and his thoughts, as we do with other senators.\nBut the President has continued to do tremendous outreach, and our staff has continued to do that. Mick Mulvaney has been on the Hill, Vice President Pence has maintained a very aggressive schedule, as well as other members of the administration, and we're going to get this thing passed with all of their input and ideas.\nQ: Was the President aware that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be the national security advisor?\nMR. SPICER: I don't believe that that was known. I would refer you to General Flynn and the Department of Justice in terms of the filings that have been made.\nQ: Had the President have known that, would he have appointed him?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know, John. That's a hypothetical that I'm not prepared to ask. I don't know what he discussed prior to being appointed in terms of his background, his resume, his client base. I don't know any of that. I know that, from what I have read, that he has filed the appropriate forms with the Department of Justice, and I think you should ask him and subsequently them if you have any questions about this specific filing.\nJon Karl.\nQ: Sean, just following up on Senator Cotton, he told me just a short while ago that he believes that this bill might actually make things worse than the current Obamacare. What do you say to Senator Cotton?\nMR. SPICER: I respectfully disagree, and I hope we have an opportunity for the team to continue to not only talk to him about what we're trying to do and how we're trying to do it, but that we'd love to hear his ideas. I mean, this isn't -- as I mentioned the last couple days -- we're not jamming this down people's throat. We're welcoming ideas and thoughts. We think this is a great vehicle to restore a patient-centered healthcare bill to drive down costs, and I think Senator Cotton clearly recognizes that the current version of healthcare that is out there right now is not sustainable.\nAnd so we welcome his input into this process. We think that the work that we've done prior to putting this together with the House is something that reflects a lot of the best ideas, and we would continue to welcome his input on this.\nQ: Are you open to major changes --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, Charlie. It's not -- I'm not open --\nQ: Is the White House open to major changes or is it --\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has said before he wants to hear members' ideas. He believes that this bill encompasses the best of ideas and the best way forward. But again, we're going to let the process work its will through the House and then subsequently through Senate. And if members have ideas, we want to hear them and want them to be part of it.\nThis isn't getting jammed through, and we welcome that, and that's why the President continues to meet with folks. He met with individuals yesterday. He going to go meet with them today. He's going to be hitting the road. He wants to hear members of Congress, outside groups, physicians, healthcare providers, patients. But he wants people to have an input in this to make sure that we have the best possible bill that serves their needs and that don't look back, like we do now with Obamacare, and say, I wish was had done this right.\nWe've got a system that, frankly, isn't working. And I think that, no matter where you are on the political spectrum, you have got admit that either you or a loved one, or a friend, or a colleague isn't getting the care they deserve, or isn't paying what they thought they would be paying. And I think we have to do this right so that we don't look back the way we do now and regret the way that it was done.\nCharlie.\nQ: Senate and House conservatives said that they want sort of a return to a 2015 Obamacare repeal effort. If that effort landed on the President's desk, would he sign it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the effort that is going through right now is the vehicle that is what people are on board with. I think one of the things that we have to remember is that the process, this three-pronged process, is done for a particular reason. The reconciliation process -- which I know for most people, it sounds like a very arcane, inside-baseball congressional term -- but it only allows for certain things to happen in that repeal process.\nAnd that's why we've been very clear -- and I think Paul Ryan laid out, Dr. Price has laid it out, and Mick Mulvaney is laying it out when he goes up to the Hill -- that there's a reason that we keep talking about it in three prongs. Because there are only so many things that you are legally allowed to do through the reconciliation process.\nWhen the Democrats jammed this through, they did it in a way that they did it basically in two steps. They jammed it through the reconciliation process, number one. And number two, they gave broad authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services so at the time -- that she could unilaterally do certain things with healthcare and implement certain things that we now have to undo in the same way.\nWhat we've done that's different, though, is frankly, add a third prong, which allows for additional legislative vehicles that will go through the House and then to the Senate, that will allow some of the core conservative principles that we've talked about for, frankly, decades, about allowing more competition, allowing people to pool, allowing people to do things that we think will allow lower prices to come out of the process. And I think that's a big difference in how --\nQ: So if a repeal lands on the President's desk, he would not sign it?\nMR. SPICER: It is going to land on his desk, because we're going to go through this process.\nQ: I mean repeal without replace.\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think the way that we're doing now I think is the right and the responsible way to do this. This bill will land on the President's desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare and we will put into place a system that will be patient-centered that will allow the American people to have greater choice and lower cost.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, with the pushback that you're getting so far with healthcare, do you think it is realistic to have both healthcare and tax reform done in 2017? And I ask you that because Mitch McConnell was asked about this day, and he talked about there being certain constraints, and that the tax reform portion of it could be a 2018 item.\nMR. SPICER: I think we feel very confident that we're going to get a lot done -- continue to get a lot done this year. Tax reform is high on the President's priority list. I think it's high on the American people's priority list. And especially as April grows closer and closer, and people look down at their federal tax form and realize how much they're paying, and we see companies pledging to come back recognizing that these companies bought into the President's vision and agenda to make America more tax and regulatory friendly so that they would create jobs, manufacture more here. That's something that he's committed to.\nHe understands how important it is. Look, the President is uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman, to understand what a good business climate does to job creation and to manufacturing. And I think his commitment isn't just a campaign promise; it's something that he has lived by for decades now, understanding that that's what spurs economic growth, that makes one place more attractive to invest in or to hire more people or to grow jobs. And so for him, this is deeply personal. And I think that you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks. But we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out.\nQ: The August portion is still the timeline?\nMR. SPICER: That's right.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On drug prices, Congressman Elijah Cummings was here yesterday. He said that the President was enthusiastic about his deal to cut drug prices. Is the President enthusiastic about that? And if he is, how much pain should drug companies be prepared to take here?\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Ironic that you're talking about drug companies and pain. Maybe there's a pill for that.\nQ: Of course.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah. I think the President -- as you know, one of the reasons that he reached out to Elijah Cummings initially is because they share that and I think, frankly, yesterday came to a lot of other areas where I think that they can find common ground and work on issues. And I know that drug prices is something that he understands near and dear is helping many people get the care that they need, but the rising cost is something that is -- so I think as we look at the vehicle in terms of the specific legislation, they share a commitment to it. And I think that there will be continued follow-ups not just between Congressman Cummings but others as to what the best piece of legislation is and how we get that home.\nQ: The Democrats said that they're going to drop this bill in two weeks. Is the President prepared to push the Democrats on Capitol Hill?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I think that's a bigger conversation that we have to have with House leadership in terms of some -- maybe it is that right vehicle. Maybe Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and Chairman Brady have other ways to achieve the same goal or work with Congressman Cummings. I don't want to be prescriptive to the House as to how they work their will, but I know that the President has a commitment to that topic and that he wants to work with Congressman Cummings and others who share that same commitment.\nJohn Gizzy.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: John Gizzy.\nQ: Oh, Gizzy. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: You're both good-looking Johns -- (laughter) -- but I'm going to -- I'll come back.\nQ: All right, thanks.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First, a Japanese news service is reporting this morning that the President will have a meeting with President Jinping of China in April. Does this mean that there is a new meeting before their scheduled meeting at the G20 in July?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on the President's schedule or foreign leaders at this time, John. I think I've pretty much gotten that one down. So until I have something further for you, I'm just going to let you get on to your next question.\nQ: All right, thank you. Going back to the meeting and to your opening statement about the banks, in the last campaign, candidate Trump campaigned hard on restoring the Glass-Steagall Act, which would put a barrier between commercial and major investment banks. It, of course, was repealed in 1999 -- the repeal signed by President Clinton. Senator Sanders campaigned on this as well, noted that it was in the Republican platform in Cleveland, and said in December he'd be happy to work with the Trump administration on restoring Glass-Steagall. Is there any plans for the President to meet with Senator Sanders? And is repeal of Glass-Steagall on his agenda?\nMR. SPICER: There's no current schedule to meet with him. I'm sure that, as he has done with several other members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, that at some point, that will be scheduled. But we don't have anything on the books for now.\nBut look, he's shown -- and I think today was another -- or yesterday was another example, today another example of his willingness to reach across the aisle, his willingness to look into both chambers and not just business but labor unions and other industries where we can find common ground. And I think if Senator Sanders and others want to work with the White House on areas of ways that we can improve the financial industry, we're going to do that.\nQ: Are you still committed to restoring Glass-Steagall?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nErin.\nQ: On infrastructure, can you give a sense of timing, where it is on the priority list, and if these new reports that say that the infrastructure in the nation is in really bad shape, does that give it new urgency?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President mentioned it in the joint address. I think we're looking at a public partner private -- a public-private partnership as a funding mechanism. There is a lot of work being done behind the scenes. And I don't want to put a timeline on that.\nObviously, as I just mentioned to Blake, we've got -- we're currently dealing with the repeal and replace of healthcare. I think we need to move on to tax reform. But that is definitely somewhere that is -- we're trying to figure out how to move that vehicle. There will be further discussion of that as we get closer to the budget as far as where that fits into the piece.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. The President had this meeting last evening here at the White House with some conservative groups. Out of that meeting, can you tell us whether the President was successful in twisting arms, getting these conservative groups to back this particular healthcare bill? And just separately, I see on the President's campaign website that there is an event, a campaign-style rally planned in Nashville, Tennessee for next week. Can you confirm that? And why did you choose Nashville, Tennessee? There's a Democratic congressman that represents Nashville -- it's Jim Cooper. Are you hoping to get some Democrats behind this bill?\nMR. SPICER: So in the first part of that, you saw a lot of the statements that came out last night from some of the various groups. They were very encouraging. Their guiding principle is we want to get to yes.\nI think one of the things that's really interesting, and I addressed it earlier, is that there's a lot of members, a lot of interested parties, a lot of groups that haven't fully heard the three-prong approach. And I think Speaker Ryan did a phenomenal job today of really laying this out. Dr. Price has done a good job. That people need to understand the totality and the comprehensive nature of this; that there are three pieces of it. And I think what happens sometimes is that the reconciliation piece of this gets lost as defining the totality of it. And people need to understand the two other pieces that achieve many goals, that healthcare advocates and conservatives have fought for, for a long time that allow great competition, that allow small businesses to pool those resources together. But there's a lot of things that occur in phase two and phase three that help bring down cost and create greater choice.\nIt's amazing when you listen in to some of these meetings how often people say, I didn't realize that, and I didn't understand the full scope and totality of what the plan was. It's very encouraging. And then I think they -- without getting into details -- I think in a lot of cases, they've shared some ideas with the President that we might be able to find some common ground on. So we'll take it one step at a time.\nGo ahead.\nQ: On the campaign-style rally?\nMR. SPICER: I would refer that question to the campaign. I think the President is going to be traveling next week. And then -- but there will be -- the details of that are listed on the campaign site. There is going to be I think additional travel announced for next week on the official side. And as we get closer to either the end of this week or the beginning of next week, I'll try to have more for you.\nKatie.\nQ: The President promised to immediately terminate DACA when he got in office. It's been nearly seven weeks tomorrow and he still hasn't done it. Can you definitively say if he's going to get rid of DACA? And if not, is he giving them legal status? And what's the plan for DREAMers?\nMR. SPICER: I think, Kaitlin, we've talked about the status of that and the -- and how many steps we have to go through on immigration. In the past, I think we've made significant headway in achieving the President's priorities of starting the wall, driving down illegal immigration. The numbers that came out last night show that even when seasonally adjusted, we see a 40 percent dip in the people crossing our Southern border. That's a very promising sign.\nThat being said, the executive order, the second one -- there was a lot of effort put into making sure that that was rolled out effectively and achieved the goal of protecting the country that the President sought out to do initially. So we're continuing to take steps on immigration, both legal and illegal immigration. And as I've mentioned in the past, we'll have more as we go forward.\nQ: So he does still plan to get rid of DACA?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has been very clear about how he plans to address immigration as a whole, both legal and illegal.\nKatie.\nQ: Sean, the President is convening with conservative groups, but there's also opposition on the left. Does he plan to -- he brought bipartisanship to Washington, finally. (Laughter.) Does the President plan to meet with groups like the AMA and AARP, which supported Obamacare but are not supporting this bill?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- it would be ill-advised for me to start saying who he is going to -- but I think that what we've shown over the last couple weeks is the President's willingness to meet with individuals, senators, groups. So I don't want to rule in who is going to meet, or out, but I think that I've said before with respect to members, and I'd say it again with respect to groups, that I think if people have ideas that will help provide a more patient-centered healthcare system that drives down cost, the President and the team here will be willing to meet with them.\nSo I don't want to be prescriptive in terms of telling them who they have to meet with. Their day is pretty busy right now with the Hill, but I will get back to you on some of the other groups that they're going to meet with and we'll go from there.\nBrian.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two quick questions. One, this morning at the National Press Club, a local business in D.C. filed a Superior Court of suit against the President in regarding Trump Hotel. And I don't expect you to speak to that issue specifically, but their feeling less that -- as much as this administration has supported small business, couldn't he divest himself from this and support small business in the district? First question.\nMR. SPICER: I'm really not sure -- how would he -- in terms of what?\nQ: Well, there's 25 small businesses, restaurants, in the area, and they're saying that the Trump Hotel is taking all that business away from them. And couldn't he walk away from it and help out the small business in the district?\nMR. SPICER: Well, as far as the President's -- obviously the President has made very clear in that December press conference at Trump Tower he doesn't have conflicts and he's done everything in accordance with the guidance that was given and gone well beyond what he ever needed to do. But obviously, you can't -- your name is on certain things and that's a very big difference in terms of some of the properties that he owns. But he understands the importance of small business.\nThat's why we're meeting with community banks this morning to talk about the lending that they need -- whether it's small business, entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers throughout the country. He understands the role of small business in our economy and how many jobs they provide, and I think he's been a champion of it.\nQ: Second question was, in his speech before Congress last week, he said it's not too much to dream that at some point in time our -- and I'm paraphrasing -- our feet could be on foreign soil, and I'm guessing other planets. With the NASA budget being released yesterday, I believe, is there a major initiative for this administration for space exploration? Or are we just talking dreams?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to let Director Mulvaney get into the details of the budget next week, or whenever that -- I'm trying to remember the calendar here. But when the Director comes out he'll talk about the specific funding levels.\nAs you know, we're in the middle of this what we call passback provision where we've sent them from top -- numbers. They're sending us back their recommendations and their observations and edits and questions with respect to their budget. So we're going to take this one step at a time.\nQ: When he said --\nMR. SPICER: Obviously he's very keen on America's role in space, and I don't want to get into specific budget priorities or numbers until we're ready to release them.\nJohn.\nQ: You called on me.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, April.\nQ: It's very important.\nMR. SPICER: I know, I saw the hands. (Laughter.)\nQ: So, Sean, just really fast, following up on John, we're seeing the campaign information for next week in Nashville. You said something about talk to the campaign -- who's the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: I'll try to help get you a name. There is a campaign infrastructure still in place. It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting on campaign activities from the podium. So there's a website up, same one that was during the campaign, and I would suggest that you utilize that. But I'm only here as an official in the government so I don't want to get into that.\nQ: Now, yesterday, going to back to Congressman Cummings, you talked about some other issues that they talked about in that meeting, where they found common ground. I want to hit two issues. The vote irregularities, voter fraud and voter suppression -- where does the President see this coming together. We heard from Congressman Cummings, but where does he see -- we understand he's saying that voter fraud is real when there are other people saying it's not. But then there are factual documents and cases of voter suppression. So how is there a marrying of that in this President's eyes?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's why he's asked Vice President Pence to look into it. I would disagree with the ascertation of -- I think there's also factual evidence of people voting illegally. We saw that in Texas a couple weeks ago and in other places.\nSo part of the reason that he's asked Vice President Pence to chair this task force is to look into the issue. But we welcome input in other areas, and it's an area that they'll continue to discuss.\nSara.\nQ: I'm not done. HBCUs, HBCUs. Now, also, Congressman Cummings said that when he talked to the President and he brought up the issue of funding for HBCUs, President Trump said to Congressman Cummings that the President did not ask for money. Now, they came here, according to many of the presidents that I've canvassed, they came here with the intent of -- the fact that they were going to get some money from this executive order.\nMR. SPICER: I don't think the executive order is the --\nQ: That's what their belief was. But then what I understand is that there was talk about investment in these colleges from Steve Bannon. One president wrote this down saying that \"we are looking for a plan from you to invest in HBCUs and we will execute it when we get it. And they're looking for full funding for Title 3, Pell grant full funding -- fall, spring and summer, -- as well as a one-time $25 billion investment. What does this White House think about this plan that they're trying to give back to this White House, especially at a time when you're looking at cutting domestic spending?\nMR. SPICER: I think, when they were here, we were pleased to roll out the executive order that talked about making historically black colleges and universities a priority in this administration, moving that sort of point person into the White House so that we could coordinate a whole-of-government opportunities for -- we talked about this.\nLooking at the different educational opportunities -- expand government, whether it's health or investment in sciences or even stuff like ROTC and NROTC programs that are some of these that span out of the Department of Defense. But we've got to look at how we're providing government assistance in a whole host of ways to historically black colleges and universities.\nI think the issue of funding will be properly addressed in the budget, and at that time -- but obviously this is something that has been discussed. The President --\nQ: Is the President's request realistic? Is this funding realistic?\nMR. SPICER: April, I'm not going to negotiate the budget from here, but I think that the President has been -- made very clear that the vital role that they play in our society. And I think he's shown that initially by the executive order that he unveiled, and we will have further information for you as we get closer to the budget.\nSara.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Circling back to what you said about critics characterizing the budget reconciliation bill as the entirety of repeal-replace, how quickly does the President want to see Republicans move on phase three, the companion legislation? Does he envision those unfolding simultaneously? And then given the early opposition to the budget reconciliation bill, does the President maybe want Republicans to recalibrate their strategy when it comes to that companion legislation?\nMR. SPICER: I am not going to start to tell Speaker Ryan or Leader McCarthy [sic] or the Whip, Mr. Scalise, how to release and when to release legislation. But I think obviously we need to make sure that members and all Americans understand the totality of this so -- at a schedule that they see fit. And I'll let them unveil that schedule that -- they talk about the totality of this plan and the comprehensive nature in all three prongs that make up the repeal and replace part of this.\nIt's important I think, though, for people to understand that there's a commitment to do all those things that we've talked about -- whether it's pooling or -- across state lines. There's a lot of principles and things that we've discussed that I think are important to let people -- to know about.\nQ: What's the assessment of the situation in Afghanistan? What is the assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, because there have been a series of terrorist attack there? And does the President have plans to send additional troops to Afghanistan?\nMR. SPICER: So on troops I'd refer you to the Department of Defense on that one. I think we are in the middle of a comprehensive review on our policy in Afghanistan that -- working with our Afghan partners and the Department of Defense and our key military leaders to create an approach to address Afghanistan to defeat ISIS.\nSo we're in the middle of that process. When we have more we'll update you. But I think the Department of Defense is probably the best place to go to get that.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Today, hundreds of U.S. Marines were deployed to Syria. So I'm wondering how involved was the President in that decision-making process, and is this part of his wider anti-ISIS strategy?\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, the President was made aware of that. This is something that was done in consultation. He understands the regional issues that need to be addressed there, and, again, I would refer you back to the Department of Defense on that.\nYeah.\nQ: Sean, thank you. I have a follow-up question to Hallie's first set of questions on WikiLeaks. My question is --\nMR. SPICER: I feel like Hallie gets, like, eight questions --\nQ: The Republicans are calling for Julian Assange to be in jail or be arrested. What about the tech companies that he says that he will work with to give them these CIA hacking techniques? Should there be any legal repercussions for tech companies willing to sort of embrace and use this technology that you're taking a stance against, if you will?\nMR. SPICER: So, number one, I'll go back to the statement that we don't comment on validating or authenticating allegations of this sort as the U.S. government -- in terms of U.S. government policy. I will say that the President obviously feels deeply concerned about anybody, an individual or anybody, that seeks to undermine the national security of our country.\nI don't want to -- stay within my purview here, but I do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about -- if a program or a piece of information is classified, it remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not. And so I would just suggest that someone consult with them regarding the legal repercussions of any individual or entity using any piece of still-classified information or technique or product that hasn't been declassified.\nThere's a reason that we have classification levels, and that's to protect our country and our people. And that's something that we have to maintain, regardless of how it's thought out.\nZeke.\nQ: Sean, two questions for you. One, back to General Flynn, how concerning is it to the President and to the White House that a registered foreign agent was selected to become -- was the national security advisor for a brief period of time?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think this is what he did for a living. And as the President said in the press conference, talking to individuals that are within the realm of the duties that you're going to perform is part of your job.\nQ: -- compensated for --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that but he was being compensated, he wasn't being compensated as part of the transition, as far as I'm aware. And so he was a private citizen at the time. And when you're a private citizen, you're allowed to engage in legal activities.\nI don't have anything further on that, but I think there's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.\nQ: Sean, just real quick, it was just -- several reports out of the State Department from our colleagues that on Secretary Tillerson's upcoming trip to Asia, he will not be taking any press with him on that trip. That's a breach of precedent, certainly of the last several bipartisan administrations. Is it concerning to the White House that the administration's foreign policy might not be effectively communicated to the American public and around the world because there isn't a press pool with the Secretary of State?\nMR. SPICER: This is the first I'm learning of it, I'd be glad to follow up with you, Zeke. I don't know that. I think you all know that we have been a very transparent administration in terms of access to the President and his activities here. I'd be glad to follow up with the Department of State and follow up -- that you can share that with your colleagues.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Yesterday you said the President had no reason to believe there was any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice. Did the Justice Department give you that assurance? Because they're telling The New York Times they did not.\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of it, but that's my point, is that we're not aware of anything.\nQ: -- been told by the Justice Department that there is no investigation.\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: So there might be one, you just don't know.\nMR. SPICER: Right, I said I'm not aware and we're not aware. And that's why we want the House and the Senate to do what the President has asked of them, to look into this. But, no, we're not aware.\nQ: To discover if there is an investigation.\nMR. SPICER: No, to look into the situation.\nQ: The Justice Department is saying, though, that they never gave you the assurances that you gave us.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. No, the assurance I gave you, Margaret, was that I'm not aware. And that is 100 percent accurate.\nQ: So when you said, no reason to believe, it was, I'm not aware if there's an investigation?\nMR. SPICER: That's right. Right. I mean, I don't know that they're not interchangeable. I'm not aware. I don't believe -- look up in a thesaurus and find some other ways, but I don't know that there's a distinction there that's noteworthy. But we're not aware, I don't believe, that that exists.\nQ: What's that based on?\nMR. SPICER: That's based on that I've not been aware of. But that's the answer to that. When someone is asking me if I'm made aware of something and the answer is no, then the answer is no.\nQ: But the question was whether he was the target of a counterintelligence probe.\nMR. SPICER: Right, and the answer is, we're not aware. I don't know how much clearer we can be on this.\nQ: So it's just that White House is not aware if the President is the target of a counterintelligence probe?\nMR. SPICER: Correct. I'm not sure what we're dancing around the same question.\nQ: Well, because I think yesterday, when you came out and corrected and clarified, people took that as a definitive answer that, in fact, that was not the case that you said --\nMR. SPICER: No, it means we're not aware. I don't -- just that should be the definitive answer.\nVivian.\nQ: Thank you. I have two questions, but a really quick follow-up to Zeke's.\nMR. SPICER: So that's three.\nQ: Two and a half. (Laughter.) So can you elaborate a little bit on how and to what extent Michael Flynn was involved in shaping the current Turkey policy for President Trump? I mean, was he engaging with the Turkish leaders and --\nMR. SPICER: I don't have anything on that. You can contact the NSC on that. I'm not aware.\nQ: Okay. So for my two real questions. First, is there any official response to the lawsuit in Hawaii over the revised travel ban?\nMR. SPICER: I think we feel very comfortable that the executive order that was crafted is consistent and we're going to go forward on this. But I think, by all means, I don't want to -- we feel very confident with how that was crafted and the input that was given.\nQ: Okay. Thank you, and the second thing is Nigel Farage was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London today where Julian Assange happens to be staying. We don't know if they met or not, but was he there? I mean, he's a close ally of President Trump. Was he there in any official capacity?\nMR. SPICER: I don't keep his schedule.\nQ: Was he delivering a message? Do you know if there was contact on that?\nMR. SPICER: I have no idea. No. I have my own concerns here, keeping track of what everyone is doing. I generally don't worry about what is going on across the pond.\nJohnathon.\nQ: You already gave me one, but just to follow through. (Laughter.)\nQ: I'll take his.\nMR. SPICER: Wow, all right. Hey, hey.\nQ: But the question is not what, but Farage -- can you tell us he just wasn't there on behalf of the White House?\nMR. SPICER: Sure. I don't -- this is silly. I really don't think asking where random foreign leaders are and whether or not they are there -- I'm sure he was there doing whatever on behalf of either the --\nQ: -- ally leaders --\nMR. SPICER: He's a member of --\nQ: He had dinner with the President --\nMR. SPICER: Okay. I understand that, but I don't keep his schedule. I'm not sure.\nToulouse.\nQ: Two questions on two different topics. First, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sent a letter to Congress saying that Congress should raise the debt ceiling. We know that the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney, when he was in Congress, he voted against raising the debt ceiling multiple times.\nSo is Mulvaney going to support the raising of the debt ceiling and does the President support that? And is he going to push Congress to do that?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've got a few months to do that. I think the Secretary was making Congress very much aware. We got into -- have now been in the White House six weeks. We're approaching the 50th day here of this administration. I think we are trying to deal with the situation at hand. Part of the reason that the President has addressed a budget the way he has is to try to get our nation's debt deficit and budget in order. I think he's continuing to show a tremendous respect for taxpayer money, the way we spend money and bring it down. But obviously, there are certain things that are a little beyond our control when we walked into this building, and we're going to work with Secretary Mnuchin and Director Mulvaney to address this issue, and obviously work with Congress.\nQ: Second question on another Cabinet Secretary. Scott Pruitt said today that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming. That obviously is at odds with global scientific consensus. Does the President agree that --\nMR. SPICER: I think -- that's a snippet of what Administrator Pruitt said. He went on and said, I don't think we know conclusively, this is what know. I would suggest that you touch base with the EPA on that. But that's -- he has a very lengthy response, and so that is just one snippet of what the administrator said at that.\nAnita.\nQ: Two things. One, I think you mentioned at the top but I'm not sure, that apprehensions were down across the border. There was a question yesterday about the wall. Is the wall still needed if the apprehensions are down?\nMR. SPICER: I think so, sure. The President was very clear. It's not just needed, the President committed to doing it to the American people. And I think, while we can have a good month, and I think we'll see if that continues, that the President made a commitment to the American people to make sure that this isn't just an anomaly, and that, while they might be down, I think we have to do what we can to protect our country, both in terms of national security and economic security. So it's of course still needed, and it's a commitment that the President made, and I think one of the things that the American people, regardless of where they stand across the aisle, appreciate about this President is that he is a man that has kept his word. He talks -- he made commitments to them, and he's fulfilling them to make the country better.\nGoyal.\nQ: Sean, I said there was a second question.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, you did.\nQ: I think you've been asked this before but have been reluctant to say whether President Obama and President Trump have spoken since the inauguration, although President Trump was very forthcoming about that during the transition so I'm not sure why you wouldn't mention it. But I'm just asking that again. And there was a report yesterday that said aides for both Presidents have spoken. Can you talk to us about either of those things?\nMR. SPICER: I'd be glad to follow up. Unfortunately I did not ask the President whether or not he spoke -- I'll be back tomorrow --\nQ: Can you follow up? Can you ask about the aides?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, I can. I will. I keep my word too.\nGoyal.\nQ: Okay, well --\nMR. SPICER: Stealing what -- all the way --\nQ: It's actually me. (Laughter.)\nQ: Lost your shot.\nMR. SPICER: Look at that.\nQ: Can you tell about policy now on Guantanamo, how it might have changed, where things are with that?\nMR. SPICER: Where what, please?\nQ: On Guantanamo, on whether Guantanamo will be expanded, whether detainees will be brought to Guantanamo, whether they will be transferred out. Just where things are.\nMR. SPICER: I don't have anything to announce with respect to its expansion or its use -- expansion use. I think the President has commented on the importance of Guantanamo and the need to maintain that the people who are there are not people who seek to do anyone good. They're there for a reason, and he has no plans to close it, if that's what you're asking.\nAs far as the future use goes in terms of expansion, I don't have anything to comment on at this time.\nAll the way in the back, yeah. You got it, Goyal.\nQ: All right, all right --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, Goyal. (Laughter.) You keep trying to steal his question.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions please. One is that -- as far as the attacks on the Indian American communities across the nation, they're not new, it happened in the past also. But the Indian American communities recently have been having candle vigils, have prayers, and all kinds of those things. And also, the Indian ambassador met with the State Department officials -- President Trump recently. So any presidential message for the Indian American community, how to stop these attacks at this time?\nMR. SPICER: I think with respect to -- are you talking about the event in Kansas City specifically?\nQ: Yeah, and another one also.\nMR. SPICER: I think the President -- whether it's the event that happened in Kansas City, other events, the attacks on Jewish community centers that continue to plague us -- we saw another report this morning of some unfortunate activity. I think we've got to continue to call it out, we've got to continue to root it out, we've got to continue to engage law enforcement, whatever is the applicable level of law enforcement depending on the event.\nBut it's something that I think all Americans should be outraged and disgusted by -- and stand up for the principles that unite us, and that's what the President spoke so eloquently about during his joint address, and made it very clear that while certain policies may divide us as individuals, there are certain principles that can unite us.\nJohn Frederick.\nQ: And second part of my question, please, I'm sorry. As far as the U.S.-India relations are concerned, they have been great in the past and now we have two businessmen in India -- Prime Minister Modi is also a businessman, and he -- President Trump of course a great, successful businessman. So recently, high official visits have been going on from India to the U.S., meeting President Trump and officials, including foreign secretary and Commerce secretary and -- from the energy department from India. So where do we go -- what is the future under President Trump's administration of U.S.-India relations economically, trade, and bilateral -- all of those.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. I think he has talked about during the campaign and the transition establishing a deeper relationship with Prime Minister Modi and U.S. -- India and businesses. And I think as we move forward in terms of our foreign policy, we'll have further updates on that.\nBut as you know very well, he spoke very clearly and frequently about the relationship that we have and hope to continue to grow with India.\nJohn Frederick.\nQ: Sean, thank you. During the campaign President Trump was not shy about his desire to get the United States out of these Middle Eastern wars, yet as a question earlier, we just sent 250 Marines into Syria. Is President Trump committed to going to Congress to receiving authorization for an AUMF or a declaration of war if we continue to deploy United States troops overseas?\nMR. SPICER: Well, John, I think there's a big difference between an authorization of war than sending a few hundred advisors. And I think most in Congress would probably agree with that as well. I think that's a big difference between a hostile action and going in to address some certain concerns, whether it's certain countries in the Middle East or elsewhere.\nI would refer you to the Department of Defense on that one. I think the actions that he has done and taken with the advice that his generals have given him, his admirals as well, is something that we will continue to work on.\nQ: Two questions. One, first off, kind of clarifying the difference between the campaign stop and also the healthcare rollout. So Nashville will be kind of the campaign stop. How will the White House kind of pick and choose how that goes, whether it's going to be a presidential visit trying to sell the healthcare rollout, or one for the campaign? And then a second question.\nMR. SPICER: I think the campaign will make decisions with respect to how they want to spend their money and where they want to go. And the White House will do the same. But that's something that every President back as far as modern history has done as well. The President will be visiting several cities over the next coming weeks to engage the American people on the need to repeal and replace and other steps that he's taking to deliver on the promises that he's made as Commander-in-Chief.\nQ: And then a second question, I know Senator Cruz was here for dinner last night. Can you characterize the relationship between the two men? 2018 will be here before you know it. Do you anticipate the President will be there to support him in that effort?\nMR. SPICER: We got a few battles to get through legislatively, but I know that he enjoyed welcoming Senator and Mrs. Cruz and their two daughters last night to the White House. They had a very enjoyable time and a very fruitful discussion. But it's something that he's going to continue to do with members of both parties, both chambers, and not just here in Washington. I think you're going to see him continue to engage with governors and attorneys general and lieutenant governors.\nThe President truly enjoys this level of engagement. He likes to sit down and talk about ideas, talk about the future of this country and get their input and ideas. And I think they talked a little business and a lot of personal last night, and it was a very enjoyable thing.\nWith that, thank you, guys. Have a great day. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. I think tomorrow is going to be one-question Friday. Thank you all.\nEND 2:00 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-03-09", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

Community banks play a vital role in helping create jobs by providing approximately half of all loans to small businesses, and that's been dwindling because the community banks have been in big trouble.\nNearly half of all private sector workers are employed by small businesses.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123492", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. And buenas tardes a todos. It's wonderful to be with you all. You know, the last time I addressed the Latino Coalition I promised myself I wouldn't come back until I learned some Spanish. (Laughter.) That was six years ago, and as you can tell, I'm a slow learner.\nAll kidding aside, would you join me in just thanking your great chairman, Hector Barreto, for that wonderful speech and the overly gracious introduction? (Applause.) Hector, thank you for your continued leadership of the Latino Coalition, as well as your years in public service.\nHis record as head of the Small Business Administration was one of distinction. And I know our current Administrator of the Small Business Administration would strongly agree. I know Linda McMahon is with us today. Would you give her another big round of applause? (Applause.) Linda, could you stand and take a bow? We couldn't be more excited, the President and I, about our new leader of the SBA. (Applause.) You can give her a standing ovation if you want. I don't want to hold back on that. You can get on your feet. (Applause.) Linda McMahon, everybody. (Applause.) You know, our nation is really fortunate.\nI just love that Reagan line -- didn't you like that? I love it when I come across a new Reagan line. The difference between a small business and a big business is big government. Get government out of the way. And it's just wonderful to have someone of Linda's caliber and experience, someone who built an incredible career -- incredible career and an incredible business as a small family business into an international business, being able to lead the SBA. So thank you, thank you so much, Linda, for stepping up to serve the country.\nIt is a great privilege, great privilege to be back to the Latino Coalition once again. The last time I was here I was a congressman from the great state of Indiana. And today, I am deeply humbled to stand before you today as Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.) The reason I'm in this position is because of the confidence of my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, and because of the support of people like you all across this country.\nAnd I want to tell you that I bring greetings from the President. Just before I left the Oval Office I told him I was headed your way, and he was pleased to hear about it. And I told him I was headed to a conference entitled: \"Make Small Business Great Again Policy Summit,\" and he was very pleased. (Applause.)\nI think the President wants you to know that our administration, simply put -- and Linda will back me up on this\n-- the Trump administration will be the best friend American small businesses will ever have. (Applause.) The President and I know what our whole team knows, is that small businesses are the engines of the American economy. As President Trump said in his joint address to Congress last week -- did everybody see that speech? He said we're going to restart the engine to create jobs and prosperity and growth in America like never before. And it's already begun.\nYou know, I grew up in a small business family in a small town in southern Indiana. I went to work at one of my dad's gas stations when I was only 14 years of age. Had a dark blue shirt with a stripe on it, had my name on it. I was really proud of myself. Now, for those of you under the age of 30, if you're wondering what a gas station attendant was -- (laughter) -- just imagine if when you pulled into a gas station, some young person ran out with a name on their shirt, pumped your gas, cleaned your windshield, checked your tires, and didn't charge you any more money for it. It was a great job, a great experience.\nBut I grew up in a family business so I know the sacrifices all of you make. And as the world knows, President Trump also grew up in a family business as well. It was a little bit bigger than my dad's. By the end of the day, it's the same principle.\nI was just in a meeting yesterday with the President in the Cabinet Room, and we were talking about infrastructure with leaders. And an old friend of his said that he and the President had grown up the same way. He said, come Saturday mornings, even when we were very young, the time that we spent with our dad was we were out on a job site. And that's what it is to be in a small business family.\nI told him afterwards, I said, you know, for me, it was headed to the plant or headed to the gas station with my dad. And I know the small businesses that are gathered here know where of I speak. And I just want to assure you that President Trump and I both know the sacrifices that are required to make a small business work. And most importantly, we know this: When small business is strong the American economy is strong. And we're going to fight every day to make that a reality. (Applause.)\nNow, the Latino Coalition knows this truth -- this statement better than most. Businesses represented in this room have made an incredible impact not just in the lives of your employees, but in your communities, and frankly, in the nation as a whole. The fact is that Hispanics are driving entrepreneurship and economic growth like never before -- just like Hector said. The number of Latino-owned businesses grew by more than 50 percent over the past decade -- leaps and bounds over every other American demographic. (Applause.)\nAnd Hispanic firms have also been hiring at a record pace. This was clear just yesterday -- I don't know if you all saw that news. It's just amazing. We had the most jobs created in a single month in over three years -- the February reports 298,000 jobs. (Applause.) And Hispanic businesses were a part of that success.\nIt's incredible to think that today Hispanics own an amazing 4 million American companies, and their combined annual revenue is over $650 billion. It might be a small business, but that's big business where I come from. And Latino-owned small businesses continue to be the fastest growing sector of the entire economy.\nNow, let me pause for just a second here, if I can -- it is Women's History Month. Could we give a round of applause to all the Latina small business owners who are with us today who are charting a great, great force of success in the American economy? (Applause.) Incredible leadership demonstrated, and it's great to see your peers all honor you. I know the President honors you as well in this important month of celebration.\nBefore I move on, let me just ask -- could I ask all of those who've worn the uniform in the United States of America to rise -- the men and women who have served their country in uniform. (Applause.) The President and I just never want to fail to acknowledge the contributions of every American through our armed forces. It's amazing that the contribution of the Hispanic community in America continues to this day -- over 250,000 Hispanics are serving in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, and the Reserves at this very moment.\nI know we asked them to stand, but will the rest of you mind standing to demonstrate just how proud we are of those who serve in the armed forces in the United States and those who have served in the defense of this nation? (Applause.) Thank you for your service. And thank you for honoring all of them.\nYou know, you can't look at these numbers that we're all talking about and not be impressed. You get right down to it, the Hispanic community is one of the most dynamic communities in the entire country. Your success is America's success, and President Trump and I both know it. The President has held at least a dozen key meetings with the Latino community, especially small business owners, in the build-up of the November 8th election. He did this because he recognizes just how crucial you are to the American economy. And as a businessman himself, he knows what it takes to be successful in a tough and a competitive environment.\nHe promised in those meetings, and I reiterate today, to give you the help you need to become even more successful in the years ahead. All my friends -- I like to say, if you haven't noticed, that the White House these days, we're in the promise-keeping business again in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nIt's been incredibly exciting since literally -- I'd like to say day one, but it was actually night one. We came in from that parade, and the President sat down at his desk and went right to work and hadn't slowed down for a minute since. Literally, from that very first day, President Trump went right to work, undoing job-destroying policies and executive orders over the last eight years. After years of delay, for instance, the President signed his executive order to authorize the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines that will create tens of thousands of jobs and support our energy infrastructure. (Applause.)\nHe's already signed several bills that Congress has provided, rolling back reams of red tape in Washington, D.C. And he signed an executive order instructing every agency in our nation's capital to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on Americans and American businesses. (Applause.)\nSo it is an especially big deal for small business. And, folks, we're just getting started, I can promise you that. By now, all of you know that President Trump and our administration has the boldest and best agenda America has seen for a very long time. And what I can tell you now is that on the very top of that list, I can promise you, the Obamacare nightmare is about to come to an end. (Applause.)\nNow, I don't have to tell small business owners gathered here today about why this failed law has got to go. In the last few years it's been hard enough for hardworking Americans in small businesses to get ahead, and frankly, Obamacare has only made it more difficult to grow a business and make ends meet. Millions of Americans have felt Obamacare's disappointments firsthand. Today the average American is paying $3,000 more a year for health insurance. And the premiums just last year alone, the average premiums across the country spiked by more than 25 percent.\nI mean, I remember -- I was in the Congress at the time when we fought against this government takeover of health care that came to be known as Obamacare. And I remember they told us that it was all about lowering the cost of health insurance. But think about that. The premiums have gone up -- like I got to tell you all anything -- the premiums have gone up 100 percent in some jurisdictions since this bill was signed into law. And last year alone, that average of 25 percent increase has really worked hardships on Americans.\nIn one-third of our nations' counties, consumers have only one insurance company to choose from, which essentially means they have no choice at all. And American businesses have been struggling, too. I'm sure everyone in this room can attest to the fact that Obamacare has hit you with more regulations, more mandates, higher costs, higher taxes.\nThe fact is Obamacare has placed a crushing burden on job creators, just like all of you in this room today. It's resulted in lost jobs, slower growth in an economy that until very recently seemed to be stuck in up to the axle.\nNow, I hear the same thing everywhere I go: Small businesses tell me that Obamacare places a weight on them that grows each and every year. They're facing hard choices -- choices businesses shouldn't have to make. They felt for the longest time that there's nothing they can do about it. And then along came President Donald Trump. And now the American people know there is something we can do, and President Trump is determined to work with this Congress and we will repeal and replace Obamacare at last with something that actually works. (Applause.)\nSee, literally, the day after the election -- and it's kind of funny -- people say, did you go right to work after Election Night? And I don't remember a night. I remember the President was able to give that victory speech about 4:00 in the morning, we got about two hours' sleep, he said, I'll see you in the office at 8:30 a.m. And we were there. One of the first decisions the President made was that the number-one priority in the Congress when they would convene is to repeal and replace Obamacare and do it at the same time.\nAnd we worked with leaders in the Congress in the intervening months to go to work on that. We've made incredible progress. Now, this week, the House released its repeal and replace bill to begin that process, and as the legislative process begins, the President and I are proud to lead the charge. Our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, in a word, is going to keep the promises that we all made with the American people from the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate and all of this administration and this campaign. We're going to repeal Obamacare's individual mandates and employer mandates. We're actually going to get rid of over $500 billion in tax increases when Obamacare goes away. (Applause.)\nWe're going to roll back reams of regulations that are strangling businesses and our economy. And we're going to expand the use of health savings account and create a new, refundable tax credit that will help low- and middle-income consumers the most. We're going to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions still have access to the coverage and the care that they need. And we're even going to let you parents out there keep your kids on your plan until they're 26 years of age.\nAnd last but not least, we're going to give states the freedom and flexibility that they have longed for, for so long, to design their Medicaid program in you state to best meet the needs of our most vulnerable population. State resources, state flexibility will bring about the kind of health care to the underprivileged that we have long sought and deserve. (Applause.)\nOur plan to repeal and replace Obamacare will do what Obamacare can't, and that is actually give the American people access to affordable, high-quality health insurance. And that's what President Trump promised, and that's what our plan will deliver.\nNow, let me say, despite some of the fear-mongering that you've seen among some activists on the left, we're going to have an orderly transition to a better health care system. And we're working with the Congress right now to ensure that as we move into a system that's based on free market principles and state-based flexibility, that that system will work and be unfolding in an orderly way for your enterprises in a predictable way.\nBut passing the legislation that's moving through the Congress now is just the first component of a larger strategy to repeal and replace Obamacare. Rest assured this bill in the Congress is a beginning. Our administration is also working right now with the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, and taking every available action to give Americans increased choices and the lower cost that they deserve in purchasing health insurance. The name of the game is deregulation.\nAnd last but not least, we're going to work with the Congress and work with HHS to make the best health care system in the world even better -- with legal reforms, small business reforms, and ultimately, at the centerpiece of the President's vision, we're going to enact policies administratively and through legislation that will give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines -- just the way you buy life insurance, just the way you buy car insurance. (Applause.)\nThe creation of a national marketplace is the center of the President's vision. And we're working now through administrative policy and through the legislative process that will go forward to this spring to accomplish that.\nIn fine print, I like to say what we need to do is get that little lizard on television, or get Flo out there selling health insurance. (Laughter.) Am I right about that? (Applause.) It's just the whole idea that you all know in a competitive marketplace -- you all are successful in business -- the way you lower costs is not by growing government; it's by increasing competition, allowing Americans to participate in association health plans, allowing Americans to purchase health insurance nationwide.\nThe President's vision for health care I truly do believe is -- it represents the best of this country. It's unleashing the full power of the marketplace. And with your help and with your support, we're well on our way to a better health care future for every American. (Applause.) It will benefit everybody in this room. It will benefit the country as a whole.\nBut so will the rest of our agenda, for that matter. So let me talk on that before I take my leave and head back to Capitol Hill to talk to a few members of Congress. We're going to get this economy moving again after we repeal and replace Obamacare. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms. (Applause.) I promise you we're going to keep rolling back red tape, slashing all the job-killing regulations. We're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desk. (Applause.)\nWe're going to keep rolling back -- we're going to roll back Dodd-Frank so small businesses like yours have access to capital, access to the best financial system in the world. You got to be able to borrow to grow in small business America. (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to pass an infrastructure package so that Americans have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways and airports, and the best future that we could ever imagine.\nAnd we're going to stand up for real education reform. The President is absolutely committed to ensuring that every American parent have the freedom to send their children to the school of their choice -- public, private, parochial, charter, or home -- regardless of income or area code. (Applause.)\nI know how much that last issue particularly means to the Hispanic community. And rest assured, with the leadership of our new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, we're going to work with members of Congress to make historic strides so that every child in America has access to a world-class education.\nWe're going to do all this and more, so that everyone can climb the ladder of opportunity in the days ahead. And when the President said we're going to make America great again, he meant it. And President Trump is a man of his word.\nBut America's greatness isn't simply about policy. Ultimately the strength of this country comes from our people. And as I close, let me say I count one of the greatest blessings of my life is just simply to be an American. (Applause.) All of us, with very few exceptions, are descended from those who came here to this country, came here looking for a brighter future. Some were brought here involuntarily. Our Native American brothers and sisters were here when we arrived. But America, from our nation's founding, emerged as a land of opportunity in a merit-based society. And the truth of the matter is that it's precisely that vision of America, that merit-based society, that all of you personify. And it's been a truth, literally, a truth since our nation's birth. And as we've strived every day to a more perfect union, we continue to live out that aspiration and that vision.\nIn his joint address to the Congress just last week, the President made a couple more promises. He promised to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States; to strengthen our nation's security and, in his words, to respect -- to restore and respect, rather, the laws of this country. Now, that includes the important work that's before us today -- securing our borders, upholding our laws. And make no mistake about it, as we do that, the President has placed a priority -- as we move through these issues, the top priority, in his words, is removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threated our communities and prey on our citizens. And that will be this administration's focus for every community. (Applause.)\nThe President and I believe that a system based on the rule of law will benefit every American, including our Hispanic Americans. Every community from coast to coast will benefit from upholding our laws and expanding our economy. As President Trump said to Congress, and I quote -- \"Real and positive immigration reform is possible.\" And I can assure everyone here that as that debate goes forward, we will, as the President promised, show great heart every step of the way. (Applause.)\nNow, for my part, I take all this very personally. You see, as I said last time I was here at this Coalition meeting, I'm actually the grandson of an immigrant. So is the President. The story in my family was that nearly a century ago, my great-grandmother walked my grandfather out of that two-room house they lived in, in northwestern Ireland, walked up the hill across from their home where I've stood, and looked out at the Ox Mountains, and looked to the west. And she told him she was going to get him a one-way ticket to America because, she said, there's a future there for you.\nRichard Michael Cawley actually stepped ashore on Ellis Island as a young man on April 11, 1923. And that's how Michael Richard Pence grew up to be Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.) That young man made his way to Chicago. He drove a bus for 40 years, and he was the proudest man I ever knew, and the best man I ever knew.\nOn Inauguration Day, I'll be honest with you, I had him on my heart and on my mind. And as I sat on that stage, as I raised my right hand, I actually couldn't imagine what that Irishman was thinking, looking down from glory. Except two thoughts. I'm sure he was very surprised. (Laughter.) Because he knew me well. The other thing I have to think he had to conclude is that he was right, his mother was right -- was right about America. It is the land of opportunity. It's the place where dreams come true.\nIt's what each of you proves each and every single day. If you work hard, play by the rules, look after your family, you look after your neighbors, and you keep working hard, anybody can be anybody in America. And I just promise you, this grandson of that immigrant, and the grandson of an immigrant that I work for, I'm going to work with each and every one of you to keep the American Dream alive and to renew it and make it greater than it's ever been before. (Applause.)\nAnd really what I've laid out today is President Trump's vision and his plan to make America great again and really renew the American Dream. We have our work cut out for us, and I'm confident that with your help and with God's help, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, America's best days are yet to come. Let's get to work.\nThanks, everybody. (Applause.) God bless you, and God bless the United States.

EST\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'd like to welcome all of you to this backgrounder. I'd like to start off by setting the ground rules if I can. So this is going to be backgrounder only. Attribution is going to be senior administration officials. And anything that goes on in this room is embargoed until we walk out of the room to allow us to get you the best information that we can.\nWe're going to start with a brief statement and then we'll move to a Q&A. So you can address -- we're going to introduce everybody. You can address your question up here and we'll figure out who the best person is to answer you.\nSo, again, thanks for being here. And I'll start off by allowing everyone to introduce themselves.\n***\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'll start with just a quick statement here to lay out some of the context for this visit. So the President is very much looking forward to welcoming Chancellor Merkel to the White House on Tuesday. This will be their first meeting, and the Chancellor's first visit to the United States in over two years.\nThe level of interaction between this administration and the German government has so far been frequent and robust. To name just a few interactions, Vice President Pence met the Chancellor last month in Munich. The German foreign and defense ministers were here last month as well. Secretary Tillerson was in Bonn for the G20 Foreign Ministerial last month, and Secretaries Mattis and Kelly attended the Munich Security Conference. So we're very pleased with the level of interaction so far, and we trust that this will continue.\nWhen he meets the Chancellor, the President will express his and the American people's appreciation for the deep friendship that exists between the United States and Germany. We share so much history, and the bonds between our people are strong. Germany is one of our most important allies and partners in the world, and we cooperate with the Germans on everything from counterterrorism to European security to generating strong economic growth.\nGermany is one of NATO's strongest member states, and the President looks forward to talking with the Chancellor about how to strengthen the NATO alliance, including by ensuring that all allies shoulder the proper share of the burden for maintaining our collective defense. Every ally has to meet its commitments -- something we know the German government believes as well. So we are heartened by the German government's determination to reach NATO's benchmark of committing 2 percent of GDP to defense by 2024.\nThe President is impressed by Chancellor Merkel's leadership at a time when the states of the North Atlantic face a number of significant challenges, and he looks forward to consulting with her on our shared challenges.\nWe recognize, in particular, Germany's leadership role, alongside France, in resolving the conflict in Ukraine and Germany's enduring commitment to peace and stability in Afghanistan. Germany also plays a central role in the global effort to counterterrorism and violent extremism, particularly through its contributions to the counter-ISIS coalition.\nThe United States is committed to strengthening our political defense, security and economic relationship with Germany and with Europe more broadly. We will continue to stand together with the German people, and we are looking forward to Chancellor Merkel's visit on Tuesday.\nQ: Does the President that Germany is contributing enough money to NATO?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So the President believes that all allies must shoulder their share of the defense burden. And as I mentioned, he is heartened to hear that the German government is committed to meeting the Wales pledge of spending 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Of course, the messages from the administration so far have been strong and consistent that all allies need to be making progress towards this 2 percent goal. And he is heartened so far by the signals he has seen from Berlin regarding increases in their defense budget. And so I expect that will be definitely a topic of their conversation for the concrete plan to meet this commitment.\nQ: What will the President say will be the consequences if Germany does not meet its commitment in terms of NATO?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't answer that question at present. I think they're going to have a robust discussion about exactly how to operationalize this goal. And so I don't want to speak to any part of what the President's private discussions and negotiations will be on this issue.\nQ: Is 2024 acceptable to the President, or would you like it to be met sooner than that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, of course, that's going to be a discussion that he's going to want to have with all allies, including the Germans. But during his planned participation in the NATO leaders meeting at the end of May, I'm sure this is going to be a topic of discussion about whether it is really feasible for all allies to accelerate that timeline. And so, again, this is going to be a topic of robust discussion.\nQ: And with the Germans in particular, as a leading economy and one of the participants in NATO maneuvers in other places like Afghanistan, does the President believe it's especially important for Germany to set this example and to be out in front of this and ahead of the 2024 timetable?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He does believe that Germany, as one of the largest economies within NATO, should be setting an example and should be leading by example, as we do from the United States. And so I'm sure that, again, this is going to be a topic of discussion about how concretely we get there, to the 2 percent benchmark.\nQ: Hi, I have two questions. Will the President be discussing with Chancellor Merkel any of the allegations that Russia is potentially interfering in European elections? And also, will the two of them discuss any sort of engagement with Russia to resolve the Ukraine crisis?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, sure, what I can say is that the President will be very interested in hearing the Chancellor's views on her experience interacting with Putin. Of course, she's been doing this for more than a decade. She's met with Putin I think for at least a couple of dozen times. And so he's going to be very interested in hearing her insights and what it's like to deal with the Russians.\nHe is also very interested in hearing her insights into the Minsk implementation process and really how we can work together to resolve the Ukraine conflict.\nQ: What about the allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in various European elections?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I don't have a comment on that issue for you right now.\nQ: How do you plan to get around the potential awkwardness of Chancellor Merkel being a strong proponent of a strong EU? A strong proponent of immigration when the President sent very signals about that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think the Vice President, during his visit in Brussels, gave a pretty clear message that we are interested in maintaining our strong and enduring partnership with the European Union. We recognize that the European Union makes significant contributions to global peace and prosperity, and so he's going to be interested in exploring this topic more with the Chancellor.\nQ: Thank you. A follow-up to the question on Russia. The Ukrainian process that you referred to, is it envisioned that the U.S. might play a big role in the process, a direct role?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I think, again, this is going to be a topic that the President is going to want to discuss with the Chancellor, what role the United States can most helpfully play in this process. But I don't want to prejudge the outcome of the meeting.\nQ: Hi, I have a question about the EU. Some of the EU officials have been saying they're really worried about President Trump's views towards the EU. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? About how the EU is valued or how it's not valued, and how the conversation might happen?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, well, so I would refer you back to the Vice President's comments, which were very clear and direct when he was in Brussels, about the value that we see in our partnership with the European Union, and again our recognition that the European Union is a key contributor to global peace and prosperity.\nAnd again, I'm sure that the President will want to discuss again his views of the European Union with the Chancellor. And again, I can't comment exactly on how that conversation is going to go or prejudge the outcome, but I'm sure it's going to be a topic of discussion.\nQ: You didn't mention climate in your opening statement. Do you expect that to be a topic of discussion, and what will the President's message be to Chancellor Merkel about his commitment to either staying in the Paris Agreement or withdrawing from the Paris Agreement?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure.\nQ: What's going to happen in the interim?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's quite possible that that will be something that the Chancellor will raise. They don't know for sure. Internally, the United States is still working on that issue, and that's an issue that still is to be determined and will be discussed, I'm sure, with the Chancellor, but also further clarified in the weeks and months ahead, as we move forward to the G7 and the G20 ministerials and summit meetings.\nQ: Will the President be in any position to clarify what he want to do with the Paris agreement?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't speak for the President on that. I know that we're working on that issue internally. Whether we reach a decision by the time of the meeting or by the time of the summit meetings I think is still unclear.\nQ: And just on refugees, the President has been pretty critical of the Chancellor for her stance on that topic. Do you expect that to arise in their talks, and in what fashion will the President -- that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. Yeah, we expect it to come up. They've talked about this issue already on the phone. And you know, at this point, it's how we move forward on this. And so the United States and Germany are doing quite a bit on counterterrorism, cooperation on border security, internal security cooperation. We have the NATO action that we've already had in the Aegean to help with migrants crossing from Turkey.\nSo the talk is out there, but there is quite a bit of work going on that we will continue to discuss behind scenes. And I'll leave it at that.\nQ: The President was sharply critical of Chancellor Merkel on the campaign trail. What sort of tone would he like to set for this meeting?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of what criticism was on the campaign trail --\nQ: -- migration.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think the statement that my colleague made is very clear that the issue is one of several that is part of a very robust and expansive -- term in American relationships. So it'll come up, and we can have disagreements within the relationship, but, as I said, I think both leaders are determined to -- working together forward on how we address the issue moving forward on the security element, on the funding element, economic element. I'll leave it at that.\nQ: And what's the President's thinking in terms of how to get the Ukraine crisis resolved?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know if we want to think -- I can't say on the President's thinking specifically, but he recognizes the leadership role that Germany and France have on this. And certainly the point of this meeting is to determine how we go forward in cooperation with France and Germany on this issue. And that's why we're very pleased to be having this so early in the administration.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let's get a few questions from the back row.\nQ: With the current prioritization of defense spending by the administration, it would appear that the commitment to NATO is going up and not down, even as the President says money is pouring in from other countries. So what data is informing that? And then a second question is, will the President be endorsing Chancellor Merkel for reelection?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't endorse foreign leaders in foreign elections. Those are elections that will be run on domestic issues and domestic processes.\nOn the NATO issue, can you repeat the specifics of that?\nQ: So the administration has said that defense spending would go up, and that of course is part of our contribution to NATO. So it would appear that even though he's been critical about how much the U.S. is putting toward NATO, that that would actually be going up, not down.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, yes, so I mean, the way that the NATO budget -- or the commitment to defense spending is calculated, I mean, you look at the U.S. defense budget, it's -- we're a global power. So we are committing part of that to Europe, part of that to Asia, elsewhere in the world.\nSo the commitment to defense spending is going to affect Europe, it's going to affect other parts of the world as well. And he's been very tough on the issue, and I think that he's done so in a way that has encouraged the Europeans to look at increasing the commitment as well. We've already seen the statements from the Chancellor and the government on this -- the German government, the foreign minister -- on the commitment to get to 2 percent. So we're encouraged by that and so, in many ways, we lead by example on what we put into defense. We expect the Germans to do so as well, and that's very much going to be how they approach the issue I think in the meeting.\nQ: I guess I'd like to ask two questions. One is, how detailed do you think there can be of a trade discussion at this point? How much can you flesh out for us now on that? And I guess as part of that, do you think there will be any deliverables? Maybe it's the Paris deal, maybe that's what it is. And then -- well, I have a second question but I'll wait.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of any specific deliverables. That's not the purpose of the meeting. It's to get together and discuss the range of issues that we have in our bilateral relationship. And it's conceivable that trade may well come up; we don't have any preconceived views that we're going to be expressing on that. We want to have an open discussion on trade issues.\nQ: The sort of softer question I guess is, over the course of the past year --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: May I just add, by the way, I mean, we are aware, obviously, that there was a trade surplus that Germany has with the United States, and that will probably be, if trade comes up, a part of the discussion.\nQ: But not in the context of the President promoting the notion of bilateral, and Merkel promoting the notion of EU is the bilateral part? Like, you don't think you're just --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, Germany is part of the European Union, so you could not have a bilateral trade agreement with them. You have to work through the European Union on that.\nQ: But okay, so it sounds like on the trade front, that's not going to be the hugest piece of the spending?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't predict exactly which direction the discussion will go in. I think trade will be an issue that may well be on the agenda, and as I said, we recognize there's a trade surplus and there may be a discussion around that as well.\nQ: On the softer question I think that I sort of wanted to ask, we know that Chancellor Merkel has spent many months studying President Trump by watching videos and reading things that he's written, and I'm just curious, for those of you who know him well, has he been similarly interested in sort of studying what makes her tick, who she is, how to kind of figure out a way to have a relationship in that sense? And is there going to be some effort on his part -- I guess \"reset\" is probably a loaded word, but he spent months talking about people are going to overthrow her, and the Syrian plan is terrible, and all this stuff. And he probably -- they probably both want to find a way to fix that so they can be closer allies. What's his part in thinking about that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I am not aware that he -- whether he spent time studying her or not. I assume the purpose of the meeting is going to be to build on a personal relationship and try to have the largest country in Europe and the United States have a positive interaction on a range of issues. So the goal going in would be to have a very positive meeting.\nQ: The G20 -- the previous administration kept saying that the G20 is the preeminent international group for discussing economic issues. Will it be the same for the current administration?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have any predisposed position as to whether it's the preeminent group or not. As you know, the G20 has dealt largely with financial and economic issues historically, and then it became converted to a summit meeting in the wake of the financial crisis. But as to what its role is in the broader play of international events, we don't have a particular opinion.\nQ: I guess my question is, do you think you'll be moving more to bilateral -- or are you still committed to working in these international fora?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, we will be attending the G7 and the G20 summits. We'll also be having bilateral meetings at those events. We don't see it as an either/or situation. And we'll see how the overall summit meetings go.\nQ: Given the recent WikiLeaks releases, and given what we know out of the previous administration, Chancellor Merkel's cellphone was hacked, what kind of reassurances can you give her and the German government that the United States is not looking into their television sets, their cellphones, their highly engineered automobiles, et cetera, et cetera.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're not going to comment on specific intelligence allegations. We'll leave that to the proper agencies and departments to address that issue.\nQ: Does the President still believe that other EU countries will leave the EU, as he said in January? And does he think it's a good thing?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know his thinking on that. Certainly it's for the countries -- it's an EU process, and I'm not going to prejudge what he thinks, whether countries should leave or not.\nQ: And can you just confirm that you'll have a joint press conference after their meeting?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There will. There will be a -- yeah.\nQ: Thank you. I understand that you don't want to discuss the allegations of Russian interference in the upcoming European elections, but does the United States believe that the elections should be held in a manner that's free, fair and without interference?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that goes without question. Free and fair elections without interference is the gold standard that we love to see.\nQ: Just wanted to follow up on my colleague's question. What's this administration's view of T-TIP, given what you said about bilateral -- on trade?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have not formulated a final position on that. We have other trade priorities that we've been looking at earlier, but T-TIP is out there and that may well also be a topic of discussion during the meetings.\nQ: Would T-TIP violate the President's aversion to multilateral trade deals? Or since the deal would have to be with the European Union and not with a specific country, as you said, would that then make it acceptable --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, that's an issue that we're looking at. T-TIP, as you said, is between -- one could say it's bilateral in a sense -- it's between the European Union and the United States. It also deals largely with regulatory issues and how to harmonize regulations in a way that eases trade and reduces some of the burden of a regulatory burden. And it's hard to do that if you're doing it just with one country at time.\nBut the broader T-TIP discussions are something that will await the confirmation of our U.S. trade representative and discussions with our Commerce Secretary.\nQ: Would that, by necessity, have to wait until Great Britain resolves its situation in terms of the European Union and the President's expressed interest in a bilateral trade agreement with them?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: On T-TIP, I think -- by the way, on T-TIP, one should point out that the Europeans aren't going to be pushing that issue while they have a series of elections coming up through this year, including in Germany and in France as well. I don't think T-TIP is necessarily dependent on Brexit occurring, but obviously the leaving of the European Union by the British government raises a whole series of economic issues as well that we've been in discussion with the British on, and that may also come up in the discussion with the Chancellor.\nQ: On the relationship between the U.S. and Germany, it was particularly strong under President Obama, and then the relationship between the U.S. and the UK was sort of put on the back burner. I'm wondering if you see that continuing with this administration.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think we hope to have strong relationships with both countries. As you saw, Prime Minister May visited the first week when we were in office. The Chancellor's visit is coming very soon thereafter. They're both very important relationships with us and we want to manage them effectively.\nQ: Is it realistic to assume that we can have a strong relationship with Merkel under President Trump, given that -- his insults against her during the campaign trail and President Obama's particularly close relationship?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not going to get into what went on on the campaign trail, and I really don't want to compare --\nQ: What's your expectation of their personal relationship? How strong it can be?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: My expectation is that they'll have a very positive, cordial meeting. That's been the whole lead-up to it in terms of our interactions that were mentioned previously with the German representative of the German government, and I know that's the desire that we have.\nQ: Given the President's criticism of Chancellor Merkel's policies, particularly with respect to refugees and generally the situation he sees in Germany with regards to terrorism, does he hope to convince Chancellor Merkel to change some of those policies or to close Germany's borders in a stronger manner, like the U.S. has sought to do here? Particularly because he said that it was weakening Germany, weakening Europe during the campaign.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Those are German government decisions. Certainly they're going to discuss security comprehensively, and Europe, the North Atlantic countries. But those are decisions for the German government to make. And the discussion that they have had on this already and the discussion that they will have on this I presume will focus on the areas where we can cooperate. We don't re-litigate the past, we don't go back in and atone for things, but we go forward and look at what we can do together. And that's what the focus is going to be.\nQ: Given, though, that Germany is part of the visa waiver program, for example, does the President believe that those policies are a problem for the U.S.?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know his views on that and I'm not going to comment and try and guess what his views are.\nQ: Just to go back one last time on the issue of Russia and cyber war. It's obviously a problem throughout Europe. It's also a problem here in the United States. Do you anticipate sort of a fulsome discussion on the issue of cyber war?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So again, I can't prejudge what the portion of their conversation is going to be, but I'm sure the cyber issue will come up because the President is very interested in us having very strong cyber defenses and in cooperation with the German government, again, on strengthening our collective defense against cyberattacks.\nBut again, I can't comment on how much of the meeting is going to discuss that.\nQ: On the issue of Ukraine, you mentioned that the U.S. and President Trump recognizes France and Germany's leadership goals in resolving the conflict. But at the same time, he's obviously been very critical of the former administration's failure to find a resolution there. Do you see any room for discussion about the U.S. -- to enhance our role in the Minsk agreement?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So as I said previously, I think that's going to be a main subtopic of the discussion on Ukraine, which is what role can the United States most helpfully play in the ongoing diplomatic process. Again, I can't prejudge what the level and the pace of U.S. engagement will be on that issue, but the President is going to be interested in soliciting the Chancellor's view on how the process is going. Again, she and French President Hollande have been at this now for a couple of years. They have a very good understanding of what the positions of the sides are. He's going to want to understand the dynamics of that negotiating process and see where the United States government can factor in most effectively on that.\nQ: Do you think there's any possibility that they could ask to join the Normandy format?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I can't prejudge what they may or may not agree to, but I'm sure they will discuss, again, what level of representation on the United States side, what pace of engagement would be most helpful in this ongoing diplomatic process.\nQ: Does the President have a view of what he thinks has been stalling the process with regards to the Ukrainian peace process? Is there anything in particular that he thinks has been unhelpful from one side or the other, or something that he believes should be done to kind of jumpstart this process again?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of anything specific that he's said about that. Again, he is still learning about the dynamics of the negotiating process, and this meeting with Chancellor Merkel is going to be a key discussion for him in understanding in greater detail what's been going right, what's been going wrong.\nQ: Does he at least think that there should be a larger U.S. role in the process?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't prejudge that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have time for one more question.\nQ: You guys have said a couple of times that you're not going to discuss what happened on the campaign trail. And I guess my question is, why not? Do you not believe that anything said on the campaign trail would have an impact between -- on relationship between the United States and Germany?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sorry, these guys aren't campaign officials. They're National Security Council staff, happy to talk about Germany and all that.\nQ: The relationship between the United States and Germany -- does that not have an impact, sir?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Not on the diplomatic relationship.\nQ: Well, I would like to thank everybody. I would like to thank my colleagues for being here and sharing your time and your insights. And everybody who is in the room and on the phone, thank you for participating. And I refer any further questions to White House press or to NSC strat-comm. And please remember that this is background only, and senior administration officials is how we're going with that. And thank you again for being here.\nEND 11:00 A.M.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123495", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:44 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER: Happy Friday. Good to see you all. Good afternoon. Two more days until the work week is over -- (laughter) -- full attribution to Rahm Emanuel for that one.\nAs many of you know, today is day 50 of President Trump's administration. We have a lot to talk about and a lot that's gotten done. I also want to acknowledge that today is also Brian's birthday, so happy birthday to Brian. I'll let you guys celebrate amongst yourselves afterwards.\nIn just these first 50 days, the President has taken many key steps towards delivering on the pledges he made to the American people as a candidate. He has jumpstarted job creation not only because of his executive actions, but through the surge of economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election. President Trump knows exactly what businesses need to thrive and grow, therefore adding well-paying and steady jobs to the market.\nObviously, we're very pleased to see the jobs report that came out this morning. It's great news for American workers. During the first full month of the Trump presidency, the economy added 235,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7 percent. Notably, we also saw significant growth in the construction, manufacturing and mining sectors. The unemployment rate ticked down and labor force participation rate ticked up, showing that even as more people are reentering the job market due to the economic optimism that I spoke about, businesses are continuing to grow and create new jobs.\nThe President looks forward to continuing his work with the private sector to clear roadblocks to key infrastructure projects, withdraw from job-killing trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and slash the bureaucratic red tape that makes additional hiring difficult for American businesses.\nHe has taken action to ensure the safety and security of the United States homeland, its borders and its people. He has proposed great rebuilding of our nation's military, following a full review of our military readiness and supported by a $54 billion budget increase. He's implemented new protections to prevent people from coming into our country that seek to do us harm. As a result of the presidential memorandum that he signed on January 28th, the President has received a plan to defeat ISIS, designed by the Secretary of Defense and the national security team.\nJust as he has promised during the campaign, he has made enforcing our nation's immigration laws a top priority, signing executive orders that start work on a Southern border wall, that enhance the public safety of Americans through ordering the strong enforcement of immigration laws that are already on the books, halting funding to jurisdictions in the United States that don't comply with federal immigration rules, and directing the Department of Homeland Security to hire a combined 15,000 new officers and agents to support the system and protect the nation.\nHe's outlined an aggressive legislative agenda that includes tax reform that brings relief to small business and the middle class, a massive commitment to infrastructure investment that will generate jobs and rebuild our nation, and repealing and replacing Obamacare. In fact, just this week, he began working with Congress directly on repealing the worst parts of Obamacare and replacing it with the American Health Care Act. And this particular legislation is just one prong in the President's comprehensive approach to reforming our healthcare system.\nThe administration is also taking additional steps to stabilize health insurance markets and start bringing down costs for the millions of Americans that have been affected by Obamacare, such as stabilizing insurance markets through regulatory reform, including the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, providing individuals and families with lower access -- with access to lower-cost options by loosening the restrictions on the financial structure of plans offered through the Obamacare exchanges.\nAnd finally, the President is committed to working with Congress on additional legislation that won't be subject to the budget reconciliation process, that will allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines; that will streamline the process of the FDA to bring down the cost of critical medicine; to allow for the expansion of health savings accounts to allow more Americans to use their funds for more healthcare costs -- healthcare-related costs, and so much more.\nThere's a one-page factsheet that lays out the three prongs of the President's plan to repeal and replace. All Americans can see that one-pager that's available at WhiteHouse.gov/RepealAndReplace. Feel free to download it and share it this weekend.\nThis administration is already looking forward to all that we've been planning to accomplish in the days and weeks ahead. You should have a document outlining in each of your email boxes of the President's major actions during these 50 first days. We've made it available to the public as well at WhiteHouse.gov.\nIn terms of the schedule for his 50th day in office, the President will be having a series of meetings and calls, moving even further along on some of the most significant campaign promises that he made to the American people.\nAfter receiving his daily intelligence briefing this morning, the President led a healthcare discussion with key House committee chairs. The President thanked and congratulated the chairs on successfully ushering the American Health Care Act through the first phase of the legislative process. He noted that he was pleased to see the bill pass through both committees -- the Energy and Commerce committee, and the Ways and Means committee -- with unanimous Republican support.\nThey discussed working together on additional legislation to further work towards turning healthcare into a system that works for every individual and family and business. Together, the President and Republicans in Congress will act decisively to keep their promise to the American people. In attendance at the meeting, including the Vice President, were Congresswoman Black, the chair of the House Budget committee; Congressman Brady, the chair of the House Ways and Means committee; Congressman Walden, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee; Congresswoman Foxx, the Chairman of the House Education and Workforce committee; and Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary committee.\nIn addition to this Hill outreach, senior officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have met with the American Medical Association to discuss the bill, and will be meeting with additional stakeholders in the coming days. The President is committed to making the system better, and that includes making sure his team hears feedback from all interested groups in pursuit of a more affordable and accessible healthcare.\nThis afternoon, the President had a call with President Abbas, the Palestinian authority. We'll have a readout of that call soon. The President had lunch with Secretary of State Tillerson, and this afternoon the President will meet with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. Ben Carson. He looks forward to discussing HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities with quality, affordable housing, especially the ways in which we can partner with the private sector to come up with innovative solutions to turn our public housing system around and empower our struggling communities.\nLooking ahead to the weekend, the President will spend this weekend here at the White House in a series of meetings with his team. The Vice President's office has already announced the details of his trip to Louisville, Kentucky, where he will participate in listening sessions with small businesses and job creators throughout the community, and then, joined by Governor Bevin, will hear from local small businesses.\nThe Vice President will discuss the President's economic agenda, especially the repeal-and-replacement aspects of Obamacare, and how it will reduce the burden on small businesses. He will then conclude with formal remarks at the Trane parts and distribution center.\nAlso coming up, Judge Gorsuch confirmation hearings will begin on March 20th. Yesterday, the American Bar Association reported their committee determined that, by unanimous vote, Judge Gorsuch was given a \"well-qualified mark for the Supreme Court.\" The President looks forward to seeing Judge Gorsuch receive a speedy and fair hearing, and an up-and-down vote on the Senate floor.\nFinally, the President's weekly address is out. It discusses Women's History Month and his plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. It aired this morning on Facebook Live. It is now available to watch on YouTube and whitehouse.gov. Obviously, I encourage everyone to go check it out.\nAnd with that, I'd be glad to take your questions. John Roberts.\nQ: I was going to say, your pin is upside down.\nMR. SPICER: John Roberts always helping with the fashion tips. (Laughter.)\nQ: It's still upside down.\nQ: You wanted -- is that a distress call, Sean? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Appreciate that.\nQ: House of Cards promo.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, no. There's no promo. (Laughter.) John, now on to your questions. (Laughter.) But thank you.\nQ: Our involvement of sending rangers and Marines into Syria marks a dramatic change in our presence on the ground there, and I'm wondering, how much autonomy is the President giving General James Mattis to involve U.S. forces on the ground in Syria?\nMR. SPICER: A U.S. Marine artillery unit and a team of rangers have recently positioned in Syria to provide a combined joint task force, Operation Inherent Resolve, the commander, the agility to expedite the destruction of ISIS in Raqqa in particular. The exact numbers and locations of the forces are still a sensitive order to protect the location of the forces, but there will be approximately an additional 400 enabling forces deployed under existing authorities for a temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered forces to accelerate the defeat of ISIS, specifically in Raqqa.\nI think, as I've mentioned before, one of the things that the President has ensured is that the commanders have the flexibility to do what they need to fulfill the mission. The President is obviously, as Commander-in-Chief, made aware and signs off on all of those missions, but at the end of the day, it's going to up to the generals to execute their mission to make sure that we continue to defeat ISIS and protect the nation.\nQ: Now our involvement there really sort of complicates the whole picture because we're aligned with the Kurds, but then at the same time, a NATO ally, Turkey, sees the Kurds as the enemy. And then there's what happens with Russia and its involvement with the Syrian government. So the big problem with Iraq was we never planned for the day after.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: So what are the plans for the day after here when Raqqa falls? Who occupies it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, one of the things that I mentioned in the script that is part of what the President has done during his first 50 days is issue an executive order on January 28th for the Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive plan in consultation with the joint chiefs and other members of the national security team to defeat ISIS. That is part of that plan.\nAnd so I think you are seeing a comprehensive approach to not only how we're going to engage in Syria, but the total defeat and elimination of ISIS. So that is part of an ongoing process that the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others have been involved in, in briefing the President.\nQ: But does the President have an idea of who should occupy Raqqa? Should it be Kurkish forces? Should it be a coalition? Should American forces stay there?\nMR. SPICER: I think that as we devolve that plan I'll have more for you on that. I think you've already killed one-question Friday, but we're going to get back to it.\nJon Karl, one-question Friday.\nQ: Okay, I'll make it one. Sean, the chair and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee have asked the Justice Department to turn over any information that they have that there was any wiretapping of President-elect Trump, candidate Trump at Trump Tower. If there is no evidence that any wiretapping took place, will the President apologize to President Obama for making such a serious charge?\nMR. SPICER: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I think it's important to see where that goes, and I don't want to prejudge their work at this time.\nJim.\nQ: But if there's no evidence, I mean, what's he --\nMR. SPICER: But I think you're asking, well, what if there's evidence? I'm not going to get into a series of hypotheticals, prejudging the outcome of a report or an investigation that hasn't occurred yet. I think once that's done, we'll respond appropriately.\nJim.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Senator Cory Gardner was reported by Politico yesterday to have said he doesn't believe that a $14-billion wall along the Mexican border is the best way to provide border security. Does the White House see support for the border wall weakening in Congress?\nMR. SPICER: No. The President was very clear that was something that he campaigned on and promised the American people as an effort to both protect our national security and our economic security, and he's going to fulfill that pledge. He's already started to work with the Department of Homeland Security on both the plans, and the funding mechanism and the bidding and the RFP process will roll out slowly -- or shortly, I should say. But that's a pledge that he intends to maintain.\nJohn Bennett.\nQ: Sean, a lot of action on the Hill of course with healthcare lately, but April 28th is right around the corner, government funding expires. Given that during the transition period you guys asked for a short-term CR so you could weigh in once you were in office, what's the White House doing right now to avoid a shutdown? I talked to some sources, they couldn't point to specific talks. So what's the state of play there?\nMR. SPICER: Well, Director Mulvaney is going to release his budget on the 16th. That's the first step in working with them to get the budget under control. We're approaching $20 trillion of our debt, and I think we need to get spending under control.\nAnd so part of funding the government goes hand in hand with keeping track of what we're spending it on and how we're spending it on, what our priorities are. We've begun that passback process that we talked about internally within the executive branch. Director Mulvaney has had several conversations with members on the Hill on both sides, and he's going to continue to have them. I know the Vice President has been actively engaged as well.\nBut to your question, I mean, that's part of the process. We need to release a budget first about what our priorities are for the coming fiscal year, and then make sure that we do what we can going forward. But this goes hand in hand with that.\nQ: -- finish out the current fiscal year, so does the --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. That's fiscal year '17, but I think they go hand in hand. I think you need to close out FY17 and then I think our budget lays out where we want to go in FY18. And I think once we have a handle on FY18, we can start to backfill 2017.\nQ: -- a specific ask, you want cuts for the rest of '17?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I appreciate -- we're not having that discussion here.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. And I will honor the one-question Friday. The President has said in the past the he welcomes compromise, and they're open to compromise on the immigration legislation that's coming up. This morning when she spoke at the Christian Science Monitor press breakfast, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that she would like to see the comprehensive immigration package that passed the Senate but was stopped in the House brought back, and that was her version of a compromise on immigration. What's the administration's position on what former Speaker and Minority Leader --\nMR. SPICER: I think you're referring the Gang of Eight bill, correct?\nQ: That's correct.\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's been very clear during the campaign trail that that's not a bill that he supports. But he looks forward to engaging with members to find a way forward to fix our broken immigration system.\nThat bill in particular I think is a nonstarter. It was a nonstarter when it came out the first time. I think it continues to be a nonstarter. But the President recognizes that the system is broken and that he wants to work with Congress to fix it.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Does the White House believe there's such a thing as the deep state that's actively working to undermine the President?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's no question when you have eight years of one party in office that there are people who stay in government who are affiliated with, joined, and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration. So I don't think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration, and may have believed in that agenda and what to continue to seek it. I don't think that should come as a surprise to anyone.\nQ: And will the Director of the CIA or the DNI have a presidential mandate to seek these people out and fire them or purge them from the government?\nMR. SPICER: That's not part of the CIA's mandate under any circumstances, so I don't know on that.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, thanks. The DNC just put out a statement a little while ago saying it is President Obama who deserves the credit for the February jobs numbers.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure they did.\nQ: My question to you, how much do you feel that President Trump should be credited for that, and how would you characterize the economy that President Trump was handed over by President Obama?\nMR. SPICER: Look, numbers are going to go up and down. We recognize that. But I think there's no question when you look at the CEOs that hire people and the CEOs that have talked about the investment that they want to make in America -- you can look back over the last several administrations, I don't believe I've ever seen the number of CEOs and businesses come out and talk about investments and continuing investments and the expansion of investments or hiring based on the vision and agenda of an administration the way they have in this one.\nAnd so it's not just a question of what we believe. I think if you look at the automakers, the other manufacturers, and, frankly, some of the service industries that have come out and talked about the investment that they're going to make, or the continuation of a project that they had going, or the movement of one -- of a manufacturing plant or job investment -- those speak for themselves. It's not a question of what we believe. I think it's a question of the commitment that U.S. manufacturers and job creators and businesses are making because they want to buy into the President's agenda and vision for creating a more tax and regulatory business-friendly environment to grow here. And I think that those speak for themselves.\nQ: Do you believe, though, that he's had -- that the policies already have had an impact on them?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. Look at the confidence indexes. They're all going to the top. I think the stock market has generated over $3 billion of additional wealth since he was elected. There are several economic indicators that show signs of strength because of the President's vision and agenda. And I don't think that that's any secret.\nI mean, when you talk to the economists, when you talk to business leaders, they have confidence in the President's agenda that it will yield for a more favorable business climate to hire more Americans, to expand the manufacturing based in America, to make us more competitive around the globe. And so I do believe that. But I don't think it's a question of what I believe or what the administration believes. I think if you look at what outside economists and what business leaders do, they confirm that.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. In the past, the President has referred to particular job reports as \"phony\" or \"totally fiction.\" Does the President believe that this jobs report was accurate and a fair way to measure the economy?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I talked to the President prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly -- \"They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now.\" (Laughter.)\nSara.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Could you clear up what appears to be some tension between what you said yesterday about when the administration or the President was made aware of General Flynn's foreign lobbying ties and the AP reporting today that the transition team was informed of Flynn's potential need to register?\nMR. SPICER: So there's a big difference between when he filed, which was the other day -- two days ago -- and what happened then. What the AP is reporting, just so we're clear, is that a personal lawyer of General Flynn's contacted a transition lawyer and asked for guidance on what he should or should not do. The lawyer was instructed that that wasn't the role of the transition, and that it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities or subject matter experts to determine what was appropriate and what was not appropriate in terms of filing.\nBut this was a personal matter. It's a business matter. It's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual -- as a private citizen.\nThat was the guidance that was given, which is consistent with what should be done. And so I don't think it should be a shock to anybody that if you asked a government lawyer what you should do in your private capacity as a citizen, they're going to tell you you should consult experts in that area to determine what you should or should not do.\nQ: That advice was -- the transition was aware of that advice, why wasn't that then -- was the President made aware that that recommendation had been given to his national security advisor?\nMR. SPICER: Well, wait a minute, Sara. There are tons of individuals that consult with the lawyers and with ethics experts and say, I own this stock, will I have to sell it? I own a business. I own this house.\nAnd for the most part, they're given guidance as to, hey, go seek professional help, consult with this entity, consult with a lawyer. It's almost like asking someone for tax advice, calling -- and what you will -- if you call the IRS and say, hey, I want to know what I should do this, they will tell you to consult a tax attorney.\nThat's not the job of a government official, is to tell you what you should or should not do in your capacity as a private citizen. And so that's a vastly different scenario that any -- whether you -- regardless of what department you call in government, if you call the Department of Education and ask them about education standards, they'll probably refer you to a local entity or to a teacher if you're asking about your own child. That's not why government officials -- they're very clear about the line between private action and government action.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Does the President agree with House conservatives that the sunset date for the Medicaid expansion should be moved up to the end of next year?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the bill that is before the House right now, the reconciliation piece -- and again, I cannot reiterate it enough -- is part of a three-prong process.\nBut the current process does several things. Number one, it's the first time that you're going to have a full addressing of an entitlement like this in decades. It is actually a very, very good thing for conservatives when you look at how we're going to address Medicaid and an entitlement that many conservatives have fought for years need to be addressed.\nBut that being said, the President has also been very clear through all of the discussions -- and I've commented on that throughout the week -- that as he meets with members of Congress and outside groups, that if someone has got an idea that can make this legislation more accessible, give more choice to the American people, drive down costs, make it more patient-centric, he wants to listen to it.\nBut I think right now that's where the bill stands. We're going to continue to listen and work with members of the House and then eventually the Senate. And so I don't want to prejudge where -- the process itself. But the bill was crafted in a way that I think represents the President's thinking and in a -- very smart way of addressing entitlements and going forward.\nFrancesca.\nQ: So just to put a pin in it, the President is willing to negotiate on the sunset of the expansion of Medicaid?\nMR. SPICER: Right. Right now the date that's in the bill is what the President supports. He is willing to listen to individuals on different aspects of the bill that might make it -- that might achieve the goals that he set out. But it's not a question of negotiation. We have a date in the bill, and that's the date in the bill.\nBut I think as the bill continues to work its way through the House -- and that goes for Speaker Ryan, he's got members that are approaching him with ideas and I'm sure he's listening to them as well. Senator McConnell is probably dealing with the same issue in the Senate. And that's the way that the process is going to work.\nAnd I've made it very clear since the get-go that this process is going to be one where we're going to take the best ideas, we're going to listen to individuals and try to make sure that we achieve the goals that the President has laid out and the principles that he has laid out.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Piggybacking off John and John, at a breakfast this morning -- the same one he referenced -- Nancy Pelosi also said, \"It couldn't possibly be true\" of the President's allegations against the former President, \"because that is not how our system works.\" She also said \"Obama would not do that\" and \"it would be a waste of time\" for the House Intelligence Committee to investigate that allegation. Does the White House have any evidence to refute House Minority Leader and former Speaker Pelosi's claim? And could you explain why the President hasn't asked the FBI chief about this directly?\nMR. SPICER: I think we spoke very clearly about what we'd like to happen last Sunday and I'm going to reiterate it: We believe that the House and Senate intelligence committee have the appropriate forum and process and staff to look into this matter and report back.\nQ: Sean, on Flynn. Can you say that the President was informed at all about this arrangement?\nMR. SPICER: No, he was not.\nQ: The need to register as a foreign agent?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And then did this set off any alarm bells with anyone?\nMR. SPICER: No, just so we're clear, you wouldn't -- General Flynn filed with the Department of Justice two days ago. How would anyone know that he was going to -- I mean, that's sort of like asking --\nQ: What about the need to file?\nMR. SPICER: That's up to his personal lawyer. I mean, again, each person that goes through the process in government seeks counsel in many cases regarding the assets they own and the activities they conducted as to what they have to do or not do. But this is something that -- it's like asking whether someone needed to file -- if they had a client, whether or not they have to file a lobbying disclosure form. That's not up for us to determine. That's up for them and their counsel to determine if they engaged in activities in the past or whatever it is. Or if a doctor needed to go and up their certification, that is not up for the government to determine. There are certain private citizens' activities that you conduct and you seek counsel on, or professional advice. That's not up to the government. And that's exactly how the system worked.\nQ: But how did that not raise a red flag? I mean, you have an attorney calling --\nMR. SPICER: You already got your question, John. We're doing one-question Friday.\nQ: But this is an important point.\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not, John.\nQ: Because you have an attorney calling the transition saying that the person who is in line to be the national security advisor may need to register as a foreign agent. And that doesn't raise a red flag?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of raising a red flag, John. It's a question of whether or not they gave them the advice that they're supposed to, which is, it is not up to them to make decisions as to what you need to do or not do. As you know, there are certain activities that fall under each of these requirements as far as what the threshold is, what activities, who the funding source was, et cetera, et cetera. It is not up to -- nor is it appropriate, nor is it legal -- for the government to start going into private citizens, seeking advice and telling them what they have to register or not. That would be the equivalent of walking through someone's tax return and saying that's not a deduction that you should take, that is.\nThat's why, when you contact these agencies, they will tell you, you should seek counsel or professional advice or expertise in whatever matter it is. That is not up to them to determine, plain and simple.\nGlenn. I called on Glenn -- John, we're going --\nQ: Moving beyond the legal question here.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nQ: Just to follow up with John, moving beyond the legal question here, this is an issue of judgment about who you guys wanted here in your administration. There were published reports that your potential national security advisor had dealings with the government of Turkey, a controversial regime at this moment in time. Congressman Cummings sent a letter to Mike Pence during the transition informing him of this and raising a red flag. Mr. Pence was on television, I believe yesterday, saying twice that he had no knowledge of that letter.\nMR. SPICER: That's right -- no, no, that's not -- hold on, it stop there. No, no, hold on, before you accuse the Vice President of certain things --\nQ: Yeah.\nMR. SPICER: Now, what he said was that he was not aware of the filing, just so we're clear. And he wasn't. Thank you. Go on.\nQ: But just in terms of the larger question here. Forget about filling out forms and the legalisms here. What does this say about the transition team's judgment about still appointing him as national security advisor when you had knowledge of this information?\nMR. SPICER: No, but you're asking me -- forget about the legalisms. That's what we ask people to do, is follow the law. You can't forget about the legalisms.\nQ: No, no.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that's what you said. And what I'm saying is, that's what we did. They consulted a lawyer, which everyone who had something of -- is advised to do. That lawyer consulted the transition lawyer, who said, it is your job to consult the appropriate lawyers.\nQ: I'm moving beyond the legal issues, I'm saying in terms of -- we're moving beyond the issue of the papers here. We're talking about the judgment that the President, the Vice President and your team made to select this man as national security advisor when you had information that he had these dealings with Turkey. Why did you guys still make that decision?\nMR. SPICER: But it's a question -- what dealings are you referring to? The fact that he had a client -- he was also the head of the department of -- the Defense Intelligence Agency, unbelievably qualified, 40 years in the military with impeccable credentials. I mean, so what is it? That he -- what exactly are you getting at? Because so far, he has impeccable credentials, he had a stellar career in the military, widely respected, and I think for you to start to impugn his integrity --\nQ: No, but Vice President Pence said that yesterday -- that he wouldn't have that --\nMR. SPICER: But again, but there was no disclosure at the time. And the question is, is that if his counsel worked with whomever he worked with and determined that he didn't, that's up to him. But it was up to him. The burden is on the individual to seek the legal advice or professional expertise to decide what they have to file and not.\nI mean, we could literally have a hypothetical question about somebody who made an inappropriate filing on their tax returns or another -- or a professional qualification. At the end of the day when people present it with you, they are advised to seek expertise and counsel and legal advice about what's appropriate and what's not. That is not -- it is not up to the transition attorney to go through someone's livelihood and determine what they need to see. They were given the proper legal advice at the time, which was to seek expertise in that matter. He had already obtained counsel, and that's --\nQ: Let me just sort of clarify. The transition officials were not overly concerned by his relationship with the government of Turkey?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of overly concerned, Glenn. The question is, did they provide him the avenue that they were supposed to, which is, did they tell him to seek counsel, and they did. And that's what's supposed to happen. That's it, plain and simple.\nYes.\nQ: Sean, I guess the question for you very simply would be then right now, does this raise concerns that there may be other members of this administration or other members that served in the transition that were or are currently lobbying on behalf of foreign governments right now that may be advising the President of the United States?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think we trust people to fill out the appropriate forms that they need to, and in this case --\nQ: But that's what betrayed --\nMR. SPICER: -- and the President acted accordingly back in the thing, and he made the right call then.\nQ: He may have been taking actions, though, he may have made the right call -- the national security advisor.\nMR. SPICER: But you're asking me -- this is -- look, this is like saying -- can you tell me that the executives at NBC News have gone through every single person's and reporters background --\nQ: They're not the President of the United States.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I understand that. But we trust people to fill out the forms that they're required to do so in an honest and legal manner. And in this case, he retroactively filed the forms that he was supposed to do, but we advised him to do what the legal and proper thing was, and that's the right thing for this administration.\nSo we did the right thing then, and we expect every employee to follow the law. This President, when it comes to ethics and when it comes to lobbying, he instituted a five-year ban, he banned people -- he has ran on a commitment to drain the swamp. He has been very committed to making sure that we institute high standards here and that we're held to them.\nAnd so at the end of the day, when he found out that General Flynn had betrayed the trust of the Vice President back in the day, he let him go. The President has high standards for everyone that works in this administration.\nSo the answer to your question is, if somebody does something that is not in keeping with the President's standards that he's set for every single person in the administration they will be let go.\nQ: So do you have full faith in all those people that are advising the President right now?\nMR. SPICER: I believe that everybody has done what has legally been required of them, but I can't tell you that every single person has done everything. I can tell you the President has made clear to every person in this administration you are expected to live up to the high standards that he has set for them, and that if you don't you will be dismissed.\nQ: Sean, the removal of South Korea's President, what's the reaction of the White House to it? And also, we know that there will be a presidential election very soon in South Korea, and we know several leading candidates. They prefer -- last confrontation was DPRK and also opposed the deployment of a THAAD system. So does the White House looking to the impact of the election might bring?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I believe they have to have an election within 60 days. There's an acting President who we have strong relationships with, and we will continue to work with South Korea. They are both an ally and a friend in the region. This is obviously an issue that we continue to keep up with on the developments there. It's a domestic issue in which the United States takes no position in the outcome of that election.\nIt's up to the Korean people and their democratic institutions to determine the future of their country. The United States continues to be a steadfast ally, friend and partner to the Republic of Korea. And that's it.\nQ: Obviously, you guys were excited about the jobs report but maybe a little too excited, both you and the President tweeting within an hour of the jobs data coming out, which is a violation of the federal rule. So I'm wondering I guess both if there is counseling in you and the President's future? But also what you'd say generally to critics who say, the risk of doing this is politicizing what should be kind of nonpartisan --\nMR. SPICER: What I understand is that that rule was instituted to deal with market fluctuations. I could be wrong, but I believe that's why it was instituted. I think tweeting out \"Great way to start a Friday,\" here are the actual numbers that you all have reported, is a bit -- I mean, don't make me make the podium move. (Laughter.) I mean, honest to god, like, every reporter here reported out that we had 235,000 jobs, 4.7 -- there isn't a TV station that didn't go live to it. So to tweet out \"Great way to start a Friday,\" I think, yes, the President was excited to see more Americans back to work.\nI don't think that's exactly a market disruption. I think that there's a lot of excitement in this country when we look at the policies that the President has instituted to help put more Americans back to work.\nSo I mean, I understand the rule, but let's --\nQ: The Obama White House, for instance, went out of their way not to comment in that hour-long period. They would rearrange the President's schedule around it. It was something that they and previous --\nMR. SPICER: I get it. And I think there's a difference --\nQ: -- going forward, yeah.\nMR. SPICER: It's not about commenting. I think it's one thing to give analysis and whatever; literally tweeting out great news. I think, yes, we are excited that when the President and the rest of the team saw the news this morning, as reported on every television station, Twitter, the Internet and every major news site in the country and around the world -- we were excited to see so many Americans back to work.\nSo I apologize if we were a little excited. And we're so glad to see so many fellow Americans back to work. But that's -- Ashley.\nQ: Sean, Congressman Cummings' letter to the Vice President in November did lay out that General Flynn was being paid to lobby for Turkish interests during the campaign. Why did that not raise a red flag to the Vice President?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of raising a flag. Remember -- I think we keep forgetting something -- his attorney then went to a transition attorney who was told, you need to seek counsel on this and get further guidance. That's the job. It's not a question of \"raise flags,\" it's not for us to adjudicate whether or not someone needs to file under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the FARA Registration Act. That's not the job of a transition attorney. It's to tell them to seek additional counsel, or to explain to them where to find that information, not to tell them what to do or not to do.\nQ: But I'm asking about Vice President specifically -- not saying you should go to this attorney or giving legal advice, but why, when this information was brought to the Vice President's attention, didn't he raise questions, bring it to the President, look into it further?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think it's fairly simple to say why didn't this occur. We're going through several people. The answer is, did they seek the appropriate professional advice and counsel, and they did. And that's the answer.\nAlexis.\nQ: I have a healthcare question for you.\nMR. SPICER: Oh, good. (Laughter.)\nQ: Aren't you relieved.\nMR. SPICER: That's the appeal about it.\nQ: Would the President be willing to sign legislation -- is he flexible about the refundable tax credit portion of the House bill? Would he be willing to sign legislation that avoided that particular provision? Because, as you know, conservatives are concerned that that's an additional entitlement.\nMR. SPICER: I think that, more and more, as the President talks to members of Congress and outside groups -- number one, I think they're excited to understand the totality of this, and I think he addresses this in the weekly address that you can at whitehouse.gov, that continues to explain the comprehensive aspect of this. Our reconciliation piece, the administrative piece that Secretary Price will institute, and then the additional legislation -- buying healthcare across state lines, allowing small businesses to pool their things, allowing health savings accounts to expand, the streamlining of the FDA, going after medical malpractice -- all those things that bring costs down.\nBut as I've noted before, I mean, people have to remember that if you get your healthcare through your employer, which the majority of Americans do, you are not taxed on that, your employer is not taxed on it. It is fairly inadequate and unbalanced for small business owners, ranchers and farmers, sole proprietors to have to face a disproportionate tax burden because they're not a big employer. I think this is something that conservatives should be embracing, and I think the more that they understand the comprehensive nature of this, they are beginning to support more --\nQ: So the President wants it to stay, the refundable tax credit provisions?\nMR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely.\nQ: Okay.\nQ: Yes -- House Republicans that wrote a letter to the White House asking about why IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is still in his job. Do you have any response to that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I'd refer you to the Department of Treasury on that. Yeah.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The other day, the President tweeted that, for the past eight years, during the Obama presidency, Russia \"ran over\" the United States and, in particular, picked off Crimea and added missiles, which the President described in his tweet as \"Weak!\" Given that he seems to be focused on Crimea, at least as far as the tweet is concerned, will the President use the authority and funding granted him in the NDAA to send lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, as has been called for by the House and Senate Armed Services Committee chairmans, and was in was in both party platforms, although the Republican language was watered down? And if he's not going to -- I did ask you this about several weeks ago when Senator McCain sent a letter asking for this -- if the President doesn't want to do it, is that because he would rather focus his efforts with Russia on partnering to try to defeat ISIS?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think Ambassador Haley has noted at the U.N. that any attempt to undermine sanctions that currently exist because of the annexation of Crimea will remain in place until that issue is resolved. I'm not going to -- the President, when it comes to his overall negotiating strategy, has made it very clear in a variety of circumstances that his philosophy is not one that says, \"I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.\" He holds his cards close to his vest to maximize his negotiating strategy.\nQ: But why does sending weapons to Ukraine have anything to do with sanctions?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the President's negotiating strategy. I will tell you that, as he continues to engage with the President of Russia and Secretary Tillerson --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I'm not. We're not -- Ryan, it's your birthday. You get a question.\nQ: Going back to -- my staff, we've got about several dozen emails on -- we talked to congressmen this morning who were getting these emails saying, if you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, why not give everybody what Congress and Senators get? Can you address that, since Congress won't?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think part of what we're trying to do, we -- someone asked the other day about federal benefits. Right now, a third of the counties around our country have one provider. That's not choice. I think the President understands that very clearly, and that's, frankly, why he's pushing the American healthcare -- you know, why we're doing this, is that so many Americans have no choice, and that he wants there to be greater choice and lower costs.\nBy doing the stuff that we're doing, especially the third prong of this -- allowing competition over state lines, taking the government mandates away from what they have to include -- that's really going to institute more choice. There will be more options.\nIf you remember, prior to Obamacare, you could go out on the open market and go from a variety of different options and tailor what you or your family needed based on the conditions that you sought or the deductible that you wanted. And choice dried up with Obamacare. I think that's the point, though, is that if you want more of that kind of a system, then this is the bill and the legislation and the comprehensive approach that you should be supporting.\nQ: But specifically, the perception that somehow senators and congressmen get better care than the rest of us. Can you address that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, that's what I -- yes, I think that's why we're trying to pass it the way we are. We want more choice. We want more competition. We want lower costs. The American people deserve a better healthcare system, and that's what this President is pushing for.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, did the White House sign off on Secretary Tillerson's decision not to take the press with him on what should be an important trip to Asia, and the growing North Korean threat? And what are his marching orders? You talked a lot about the flexibility the President has given to his generals. What flexibility has he given for diplomatic initiatives to his Secretary of State?\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned at the beginning, the President is having lunch with Secretary Tillerson. I know that the trip was one of the topics of discussion, and so I will try to follow up with that.\nAnd with respect to the first part of the question, press is being invited to that trip. They're traveling commercially. There is a press logistics component to make sure that they can get everywhere, that they're given access to everything. There's a press conference --\nQ: You can possibly to go to all three of those cities commercially to cover him in the way that --\nMR. SPICER: The plane that the Secretary is taking doesn't accommodate that, but they have made accommodations for members of the press to cover everything. And I know that --\nQ: Is that something you advised to him?\nMR. SPICER: No, we don't get involved in the logistics for every Cabinet member's trip. I would advise you to touch base with the Secretary, with the State Department on this. But I know that they have made aware of the concerns of some of your colleagues, and they are making accommodations in the future with respect to the size of the plane.\nBut make no mistake about it, there is a logistics component to make sure that the press is welcome throughout the trip and at every stop, and that accommodations are taken care of, and there's logistical support to do that. There will be a press conference component as well.\nQ: Would you like, though, public diplomacy and this kind of important diplomatic initiative for this administration to be covered fully going forward?\nMR. SPICER: I think it will. I hope it will be covered fully.\nQ: And should they be -- reporters allowed to be on the place with the Secretary, as they have for many years?\nMR. SPICER: And I think that, when appropriate, they can. And again, there's a big difference between making sure that we carve out X number of seats and making sure that we have transparency and openness in covering events. They have logistical support for you all, to make sure that you have hotels. There's travel support. There's accommodations and filing centers. I mean, at some point, this isn't about blocking anybody. They've gone above and beyond. Not every plane can accommodate every member of the press.\nQ: You couldn't get a bigger plane?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question -- there's an element of tax --\nQ: Most Secretaries of State can accommodate that.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. I understand that, and there's an element of cost-savings at this point that the Secretary is trying to achieve. But at the end of the day, there has been a press component to every stop of the Secretary's trip. He is doing everything he can to logistically support the press who wants to come and cover him, and they are being open to make sure that Secretary is available throughout the trip.\nQ: President Trump has been -- was very critical of German Chancellor Merkel on the campaign trail. I was just wondering, how does the White House think that will affect the tone of the meeting on Tuesday, and what type of tone does the President plan to take?\nMR. SPICER: I know that we did a bit of a readout earlier today on that. There's a lot of excitement on both sides of the ocean for this trip. I know that we are looking forward to meeting with the Chancellor and her team, and I've talked to their folks over there and they're very excited about coming over. There's a lot of trade and economic interests on both sides, and obviously there's an element of national security that we share.\nAnd so I will let the trip's -- look forward to the readout, but there is a lot of excitement coming. And I think the President looks forward to meeting with the Chancellor and discussing areas of shared national interest with her.\nAthena.\nQ: Just following up on all of this Flynn discussion. I gather from today and yesterday, correct me if I'm wrong, I want to make sure I understand the answer to this question. Are you saying the President was not aware that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be national security advisor?\nMR. SPICER: Correct. Well, and just remember, you wouldn't know that until he filed. He didn't file until two days ago, so therefore, nobody would have known that because he hadn't filed as a foreign agent until two days ago.\nQ: My understanding is that he had filed a lobbying disclosure with Congress in November.\nMR. SPICER: Again, that's different than filing a FARA request with the DOJ.\nQ: And one more question --\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's one-question Friday. (Laughter.)\nQ: It's very much attached to this.\nMR. SPICER: All right.\nQ: The other question is, did Flynn disclose he was acting as a foreign agent in the security clearance review before he became NSA?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that question. That's something that you should follow up with General Flynn on.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, I want to go back to the numbers. When is it when a former President's spillover ends and the new President stands on his own merit? When does that happen?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think on January 20th at noon, you start to assume command of the government, and -- what specifically are you asking for?\nQ: The numbers from jobs. You're taking --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that this is the first full month that encapsulates the President's administration. I think that's a very telling number. Look, and I get it. These numbers are going to go up and down. But I think for the first full month, we're seeing the enthusiasm and spirit that so many business leaders have been drawn to, and that is exciting as a first month. But I think this encapsulates a full 30 days of the Trump presidency, and so we're going to continue to work forward with policies that will lower regulation and lower taxes, create a more business-friendly and entrepreneur-friendly business climate to allow the expansion of U.S. companies and grow U.S. jobs.\nQ: And lastly, over the last couple of weeks we've heard all the negatives -- well, not all the negatives, but a large portion of negatives about the Affordable Care Act, and how you're looking to make it patient care. So with that, are there any positives which you could articulate from ACA that will carry into possibly patient care?\nMR. SPICER: I think children being able to stay on their plans to 26. There's a preexisting-condition piece. But again, remember --\nQ: That's going to states, the way we understand it. That's subject to --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, but that -- you're asking if there's elements. I think those are some things that -- and again, remember, there was some stuff that was part of the ACA that is stuff that Republicans had supported for a while as well. I think this is making sure that this is the most effective and comprehensive healthcare policy that achieves the President's goals.\nQ: So those are the only two? Those are two --\nMR. SPICER: Yes. You asked -- I don't know, April, I'm sure I could go through the bill and get back. It's very long, as you saw the other day. It's a thousand-page --\nQ: -- pages versus --\nMR. SPICER: Nine hundred seventy four pages. Very good.\nDavid Jackson.\nQ: The Palestinians are saying that President Trump invited President Abbas to the White House for a meeting very soon. Can you confirm that?\nMR. SPICER: I can. Thank you guys very much. Let's end on a positive note. Have a great weekend. We look forward to seeing you. Take care everybody. Thank you.\nEND 2:44 P.M.

Trump", "note": "The address was recorded on March 10 in the Cabinet Room at the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123490", "text": "My fellow Americans, in March, we celebrate Women's History Month, honoring the countless contributions that women leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs have made throughout American history.\nWe are a greater, stronger, and more just Nation today because of women like Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and so many others. We honor them, and we recommit ourselves to a better future for every woman in America today.\nOn my 50th day in office, I want to talk about an issue of paramount importance to families across our Nation: health care.\nSeven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people. Our citizens were told they'd have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was. Now, we know that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises.\nAmericans were promised that Obamacare would bring premiums down $2,500 for a typical family. Instead, they've gone up by more than $4,000. Americans were promised that Obamacare would increase competition and provide them with more choices. Instead, the number of plans to choose from has plummeted—and I mean plummeted. This year, Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, or, in effect, no real choice at all.\nAmericans were promised that if they liked their health insurance and their doctors, they could keep them. Instead, millions of Americans lost the insurance and lost the doctor that they liked and were thrust into a cold new reality of higher costs and less coverage.\nThrough 7 long years of botched rollouts, soaring cost, cancelled plans, and bureaucratic mandates, Americans have called out for relief. And relief is what we are determined to give them.\nI want every American to know that action on Obamacare is an urgent necessity. The law is collapsing around us, and if we do not act to save Americans from this wreckage, it will take our health care system all the way down with it. If we do nothing, millions more innocent Americans will be hurt, and badly hurt. That's why we must repeal and replace Obamacare.\nHouse Republicans have put forward a plan that gets rid of this terrible law and replaces it with reforms that empower States and consumers. You will have the choice and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for your family. The House plan follows the guidelines I laid out in my recent address to Congress: expanding choice, lowering costs, and providing health care access for all.\nThis plan is part of a three-pronged reform process. In concert with the plan in front of Congress, I have directed Dr. Tom Price, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, to use his authority to reduce regulations that are driving up costs of care. We are also working on reforms that lower the costs of care, like allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across State lines. You've heard me say that many, many times during the debates.\nI encourage Democrats to work with us to improve the health care system for the American people. Also, we will be driving down the costs.\nWe will deliver relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, who right now are being crushed by Obamacare, by increasing freedom, choice, and opportunity for the American people.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-10", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Goodlatte; and former President Barack Obama. Participating in the meeting were Vice President Michael R.

I want to thank each of the House committee leaders for being with us today. Your devotion and leadership has been amazing, and I want to just applaud you and the diligent work of your committees to advance the Obamacare repeal and replacement legislation that we've been talking about for a long time, and that we've been running with, and I ran with and I can tell you. And that's what people want, they want repeal and replace. The bill passed just now through Ways and Means and it will—I think the committee just voted recently, right?\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Gregory P. Walden. Yes.\nThe President. Your other committee——\nChairman Walden. Energy and Commerce.\nThe President. Energy and Commerce. And it was a very good vote, and congratulations. That was a good job. Amazing.\nWe must act now to save Americans from the imploding Obamacare disaster. Premiums have skyrocketed by double digits and triple digits in some cases. And as an example, Arizona—which I talk about all the time—116 percent increase and it's going up a lot higher; '17 would be a disaster for Obamacare. That's the year it was meant to explode, because Obama won't be here. That was when it was supposed to be—it will get even worse. As bad as it is now, it'll get even worse.\nChoices are disappearing as one insurer drops out after another. Today, one-third of all counties now have only one insurer on the Obamacare exchanges, and the exchanges themselves are a disaster. The House repeal and replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes, cutting taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. It eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to buy Government-approved plans. We all know that one.\nIt provides States with flexibility over how Medicaid dollars are spent, giving power from Washington and back to local government, which we all want to see. They're going to do a much better job. And the plan empowers individual Americans to buy the health insurance that is right for them, not the plan forced on them by Government. You all remember, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. I know, Greg, you've never heard that, right?\nChairman Walden. No, just a few times.\nThe President. But it was said many, many times, and it turned out to be not true.\nThis is the time we're going to get it done. We're working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit, and I think it's something that is just going to happen very shortly.\nSo thank you all very much, and we're going to get to work.

Kentucky is open for business. (Applause.)\nGovernor, the President and I are proud to partner with you to make Kentucky great again, as we make America great again. (Applause.) I get along great with people from Kentucky, except in March. (Laughter.) It's gets a little testy some evenings.\nBut the same goes with all my strong feeling about your governor goes for other dedicated public servants who are here. State Senator Ralph Alvarado just joined us for a great discussion. And two great congressmen who I served with in Washington, D.C. Congressman Andy Barr and Congressman Brett Guthrie, would you all just take -- stand up and let these people show how much they appreciate your conservative stand in Washington, D.C. (Applause.) Thank you both.\nAnd I got to tell you it's great to be in the home state of the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell. He's a true friend to me, to our President, and to the people of America. (Applause.)\nGreat to have the privilege to be back in the Bluegrass State. Last fall, thanks to all of you here in Kentucky, to your hard work, your support, and your prayers, Kentucky voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America in a decisive vote. (Applause.)\nAnd it was quite a campaign, wasn't it? And it's been quite an administration, too. I got to tell you on a very personal level, it's the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. And I want to thank you all for the privilege. (Applause.)\nThe President is a man of boundless energy, optimism. I like to say he's got broad shoulders and a big heart.\nAnd speaking of which, the President asked me late yesterday when we were leaving the White House in the evening to just say thanks to everyone gathered here today. Hardworking Americans like all of you were some of our biggest supporters. And on behalf of President Trump, thank you. Thank you for your support, and thank you for being here today. We're truly grateful. (Applause.)\nAnd to all the business owners who are with us here today, I enjoyed our discussion earlier. The Governor and I had a brisk discussion about the challenges that -- changes in healthcare in this country since 2010 have presented to business. I appreciate your candid feedback about what our administration can do to help your businesses succeed and grow. And I have to tell you one other person I want to mention before I thank our host, it is always good to have Papa John in the house. John Schnatter and his wonderful wife are with us today. The Midwest is proud that you call Kentucky and America home. (Applause.) John, thank you. There he is.\nBut last but not least, on behalf of the President, let me thank Harshaw Trane for their hospitality. While Frank Harshaw couldn't be here today, not only do I appreciate the warm welcome of his team -- Richard and Tom and Lou -- we just so admire Frank building an extraordinary business, someone who grew up in foster care. Frank and his story are the story of the American Dream. And would you join me in thanking them for allowing this great business to be our backdrop. (Applause.)\nAnd all of those who run businesses, own businesses, or work in small business, let me make you a promise: The President wants you to know that our administration will be the best friend America's small businesses will ever have. (Applause.)\nAnd the President and I know that small businesses are the engines of the American economy. As President Trump said in his joint address to Congress just last week, we're going to \"restart the engine\" to create jobs and prosperity and growth in America like never before.\nYou know, I grew up in a small business family, just a little bit north of here in Columbus, Indiana. I went to work at my father's gas station when I was only 14 years of age. I was actually what was called a gas station attendant. If you're under the age of 30, I'll explain to you after the program exactly what that was.\nBut as the world also knows, the President grew up in a family business, too. We both know the sacrifices that are required to make a business work. And more importantly, we know that when small business is strong, America is strong. And this President is going to fight every day to make that a reality. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump wants to help you become stronger than ever before. He made a promise to you and to the American people -- and as I like to say, this White House is in the promise-keeping business.\nJust look at what we've done over the past month-and-a-half. On day one, President Trump went straight to work rolling back reams of red tape. He actually instructed every agency in the federal government to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new regulations on job creators in America. (Applause.)\nThe President has taken decisive action to protect American jobs and American workers by taking measures to secure our border, to build a wall, and end illegal immigration once and for all. (Applause.)\nThe President authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines at last creating thousands of American jobs and building on America's energy infrastructure. (Applause.)\nBusinesses -- and if you haven't noticed already, businesses have been already reacting to President Trump's vision, his \"Buy American, Hire American\" vision with optimism and investment around the country.\nFrom coast to coast, literally since Election Day, companies have been announcing that they're keeping jobs here. They're creating new ones. Last month alone, the economy added an amazing 235,000 jobs in the month of February. This economy is coming back and coming back strong. (Applause.)\nAnd most importantly of all, the top priority the President gave us: to work with members of Congress and make sure that the Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.)\nI'll tell you, it's amazing to think about -- virtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken. We all remember the promises that they made back in 2010 when this was signed into law. They told us the cost of health insurance would go down -- not true. They told us that if you liked your doctors, you could keep 'em -- not true. They told us that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it -- not true.\nHere are the heartbreaking facts. Today, Americans are paying $3,000 more a year on average for health insurance than the day Obamacare was signed into law. Last year alone, premiums spiked by 25 percent, and millions of Americans have lost their health insurance plans and lost their doctors.\nAnd in one-third of the nation's counties, Americans only have one insurance company to choose from, which essentially means they have no choice at all. The truth is the American people are struggling under Obamacare every day, and so are small businesses like those so well represented here.\nYou all know exactly what I'm talking about. The truth is Kentucky is a textbook example of Obamacare's failures. Here in the Bluegrass State, premiums skyrocketed by an average of 24 percent last year, with some plans spiking by 47 percent.\nNearly half of the state only has one health insurer to choose from. And next year, Humana, headquartered right here in Louisville, is pulling out of Kentucky's Obamacare exchange.\nToday, one-third of the state is on Medicaid -- and as your Governor has said over and over again, it's unsustainable. And Medicaid here in Kentucky is threatening to bankrupt this state.\nFolks, this just can't continue, and I promise you it won't. (Applause.)\nSince the day that Kentucky helped send President Trump to the White House, his top priority has been to repeal and replace Obamacare with something that actually works. And we've already made incredible progress.\nThe House released its repeal-and-replace bill on Monday, and it already passed with unanimous support from two committees, one of which Congressman Guthrie sits on. And, Congressman, I just want to thank you for your strong support to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nNow I know that not every politician in Kentucky supports our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. I know your former Governor Steve Beshear has been defending Obamacare all over America. And he might even have something to say about my visit here today, and I welcome the debate. I really do.\nSteve Beshear is actually a friend of mine. We worked together while I was Governor of Indiana to promote jobs and growth all across Kentuckiana. And I'm awful proud of those Ohio River bridges, aren't you? (Applause.)\nThe great story about collaboration between our two states, the Abraham Lincoln Bridge and the Lewis and Clark Bridge I believe are going to support economic growth across this region for generations. But your former Governor is wrong about Obamacare. (Applause.)\nObamacare has failed the people of Kentucky. It's failed the people of America, and Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nNow, the plan the President outlined in his joint address to the Congress is the plan we're working on. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, and we're going to replace it with health-care reform that will improve the lives of every American and strengthen our economy.\nThe truth is ordering every American to buy health insurance, whether they wanted it or not, was never the right solution for health care in this country. So we're going to start -- we're going to repeal the mandates and taxes and penalties of Obamacare. (Applause.)\nWe're going to end Obamacare's individual and employer mandates. We're actually going to get rid of more than $500 billion in Obamacare's tax increases. (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to give Americans more choices. We'll expand health savings accounts. We'll give Americans a tax credit that will help people buy plans that they need at a price that they can afford.\nWe'll make sure that Americans with pre-existing conditions still have access to the coverage and the care that they need. And to all the parents here, we'll make sure you can keep your kids on your plan until they're 26 years of age.\nAnd most significantly in my view, we'll give states like Kentucky the freedom and flexibility with Medicaid to meet the needs of your most vulnerable in the way that works here in Kentucky. (Applause.)\nThe bill moving through the Congress today is going to give Governor Bevin and, frankly, states all across the country the chance to reform Medicaid so it will better serve the underprivileged in your state, with better coverage, better health, and better outcomes just like the Governor said -- uniquely designed for the people of Kentucky -- a little like we did in the Hoosier State not too long ago.\nI'll never forget being here for Governor Bevin's inaugural address. Anybody else remember that sunny day? (Applause.) As I was sitting and listening on, I remember hearing the Governor say that announced his intention to reform Medicaid using some of the same conservative principles that we used in Indiana.\nHe said then, that he was inspired by Indiana's reforms, but he was pretty sure Kentucky could do better than Indiana. And I'd like to see him try. (Laughter.)\nIn fact, President Trump truly does believe that giving states like Kentucky, like Indiana, like every state in the union, the resources and flexibility to improve their health-care programs and Medicaid is the American way to meet the needs of our most vulnerable, and we're going to make it happen. (Applause.)\nThis competition between the states will give the American people better health-care choices.\nAnd under President Trump's leadership, we're actually also going to finally allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines -- the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I both know the way to lower the cost of health insurance is to create a national marketplace and give Americans more choices to buy the insurance they want, not the insurance that the government mandates them to have.\nBut, folks, let me be clear, this is going to be a battle in Washington, D.C. And for us to seize this opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, we need every Republican in Congress -- and we're counting on Kentucky. President Trump and I know -- at the end of the day, after a good and vigorous debate -- we know Kentucky will be there. And we will repeal and replace Obamacare -- once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say one more thing, despite some of the fear-mongering by those on the liberal left, I want to assure the people of Kentucky who might be looking on this morning: We're going to work with the Congress and work with our agency at Health and Human Services, and we're going to have an orderly transition to a better health-care system that makes affordable, high-quality health insurance available for every American. (Applause.)\nIn a word, we're going to make the best health-care system in the world even better. Now, while I came here to talk about Obamacare, it's really just the start of what our administration is doing to make America great again.\nAnd let me give you a quick preview of that before I head back on that airplane. First off, after we get this done, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. (Applause.)\nWe're going to keep slashing through red tape and rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their metal taxpayer-funded desks in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nWe're going to do a little bit more like we did with those bridges, we're going to rebuild America so we have the best roads and bridges and highways and airports that America has ever had. (Applause.)\nBut making America great again doesn't stop just there. This President has no higher priority I promise you than the safety and security of the American people, and he's working every single day to protect our nation and our way of life.\nThis is a President I can tell you appreciates the men and women of our law enforcement community, and he is standing every day with those who serve and protect our country in law enforcement. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump, as I mentioned, is also taking steps to strengthen our borders, to enforce our laws, and as the President said, we're working through Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in close concert with law enforcement in every community, and we're taking in his words the \"gang members, the drug dealers, and the criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens\" off the streets of Kentucky and off the streets of our country. (Applause.)\nNow, while we talk about those that serve in uniform, as the proud father of a United States Marine, let me tell you how grateful I am that in President Donald Trump we have a Commander-in-Chief who will rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and protect our nation. (Applause.)\nAnd by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States, President Trump kept his word to appoint a Justice to the Supreme Court who will keep faith with the Constitution, and he'll be a justice who will uphold the God-given liberties that are enshrined in our Bill of Rights. (Applause.)\nMy friends, let me tell you, President Trump is a man of his word, and he's a man of action. And I believe he will make America great again. I think we've come to a pivotal moment in our nation's history. I truly do.\nIn this moment, we need every freedom-loving American to join with us in this effort to make America great again. We need all of you to stand up, to speak out, to let your voice be heard. There's no time like the present.\nWe need you to tell the world that we can do better. We can do better on healthcare. We can do better with a growing economy. We can stand tall and strong in a world again. We can restore this country, put it back to a path to a brighter future.\nAnd I know we're going to do this. I truly do.\nOne of my favorite verses in the Old Book is from the Book of Jeremiah. It's hung over the mantle of our home since before I was actually first elected to office now more than 16 years ago. Now it hangs over the mantle in the Vice President's Residence in Washington, D.C.\nIt reads: \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.\"\nIn November, the people of Kentucky voted to give America a President with the strength, and the courage, and the vision, to make America safe again. You voted to give us a new leader who I believe will make America prosperous again and give us a fresh start on healthcare and economic growth. And so I truly do believe with all my heart, that with your continued faith and support, and with God's help, together we will make America great again.\nThank you very much for being here on this Saturday. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-03-11", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on Obamacare in Louisville, Kentucky"}

So there's costs that needs to come down and we believe we're going to be able to do that through the system. There's coverage that will go up. Remember, Chuck, there are 20 million folks right now in this nation who said to the Federal Government, 'I'll pay a penalty, or I'll take a waiver. I'm not even going to get coverage in the system that we currently have.' That may be a system that works for government or insurance, but it doesn't work for people. We need a system that works for people.\"\nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney on CNN's State Of The Union: \"The President was very clear on the campaign trail, he wanted to repeal and replace. That's what the framework does.\"\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: \"Here's what we've got, we have a framework. We have a really, really good bill that the White House did work with House and Senate leaders to come up with. But we encourage the House and Senate to try and make the bill better. We have laid out the things the President needs. It must repeal as much of Obamacare as it can, given these strange and arcane Senate rules that we have to use, and it must do as much replacement as it possibly can. The President was very clear on the campaign trail, he wanted to repeal and replace. That's what the framework does— repeals as much as possible and gives us as much replacement as possible. If the House and Senate think they can make that bill a little bit better through the process, that's what the legislative process is about, and it's the legislative process that didn't exist for Obamacare. We've already had two hearings in the House on this bill [and]another one this week. There will be another one next week before it comes to a final vote. And that's even before it goes over to the Senate. So there are plenty of opportunities to make the bill better.\"\nDirector of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn on Fox's Fox News Sunday: \"Anything that makes the bill better for Americans, we are willing to accept.\"\nCOHN: \"I think the President is very open and transparent on the issue that he's been willing to accept improvements on the bill. We got out of our way, and the President has said this: . . . 'Anything that makes the bill better for Americans, we are willing to accept.' We've met with many groups over the last week, week and a half. We've talked with as many different groups as we possibly could, and anyone that comes up with an improvement, we are more than happy to accept. In fact, the President wants to implement many of these improvements. He's very concerned that we have as many products out there as we can for consumers. He wants to have the ability for insurance companies to sell across state lines. In fact, he is insisting that insurance companies have the ability to sell across state lines.\"\nCounselor to the President Kellyanne Conway on Fox News' Media Buzz: Our Nation has \"spent billions of dollars and many years helping other countries protect their sovereignty and their borders—it's high time we did it [for] ourselves.\"\nCONWAY: \"It's a big country out there outside of the know-it-alls. And the big country out there listen[ed] to [the President] in the Joint Session address and they still know he is a man of action, a man of impact. They know that he is somebody who just looked them in the eye for an hour and said that he will repeal and replace Obamacare. He called ISIS savages. He said radical Islamic terrorism. He said we'll build the wall. That we are a Nation that helps – [we have] spent billions of dollars and many years helping other countries protect their sovereignty and their borders – it's high time we did it [for] ourselves.\"\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures: \"There have been jobs exported and not just to Mexico, to lots of other countries as well. That balance needs to be restored a bit and it needs to be made not just free trade but fair free trade.\"\nFOX NEWS' MARIA BARTIROMO: \"And so if a company thought, well, I could go produce my products in Mexico for a lot cheaper than I would in the U.S. and then sell it to the U.S. no problem, free trade, of course, they are going to do that and that really did hurt the American worker.\"\nSECRETARY WILBUR ROSS: \"Oh no question about it. There have been jobs exported and not just to Mexico, to lots of other countries as well. That balance needs to be restored a bit and it needs to be made not just free trade but fair free trade. So if there is a new tri-lateral, we will add in an extra \"F\" that will be NAFFTA, North American Fair Free Trade Agreement.\"\nDirector Mulvaney on ABC's This Week: \"What people want is to get care . . . they want to be able to afford to go to the doctor. That's where Obamacare has failed them several times over.\"\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: \"What people want is to get care. People want, when they get sick, they want to be able to afford to go to the doctor. That's where Obamacare has failed them several times over. That's the problem we're fixing. So that when you're watching this program, when you get sick, you can afford to go to the doctor, because right now on Obamacare you can't. I had it, George, I know. I have lived through this first hand. You didn't have Obamacare. I did. $12,000, $15,000 a deductible for my family. Luckily, we could afford it. But people making much less than I did had that exact same plan, yes they got a subsidy to buy that plan, but they didn't get a subsidy on their deductible. They could not afford to go to the doctor. That was a broken system. That was one of the many, many reasons that Obamacare was failing and people are begging us to replace it and that's exactly what we're going to do.\"", "timestamp": "2017-03-12", "title": "Press Release - Top Highlights From Sunday's Shows"}

Trump welcomed to the Roosevelt Room individuals who have experienced significant hardship as a result of Obamacare's poor coverage and rising prices.\nThe individuals in attendance included:\nMs. Kim Sertich of Arizona, whose health insurance has been cancelled three times since Obamacare became law. The plans now available to her have limited networks and high deductibles. Even worse, she will only have one insurer to choose from in 2017.\nMrs. Carrie Couey of Colorado, a mother of six from a cattle ranching family whose youngest son is autistic. The pre-Obamacare cost for her family's insurance was $17,000 per year. After Obamacare became law, her insurance costs skyrocketed to $52,500 per year for a lower quality plan. Additionally, the cost for workers' compensation insurance for her business's employees increased from approximately $17,000 per year to more than $70,000 per year.\nMr. Elias Seife of Florida, who has had to change his and his wife's health insurance every year for the past few years because his premiums have increased 30-40 percent annually, and the deductibles have risen even more sharply. Mr. Seife said that the middle class has been particularly hard-hit by Obamacare.\nMs. Brittany Ivey of Georgia, a working mother whose family has struggled under Obamacare. Ms. Ivey was working part-time at a small business that provided her family with health insurance until Obamacare raised her premiums sharply. This drove the Ivey family into the individual market, where a mid-level plan cost 65 percent of her monthly gross income, even accounting for a federal subsidy.\nMr. Greg Knox of Ohio, the owner of Knox Machinery and Chairman of the Dayton Region Manufacturers Association. The businesses in Mr. Knox's association have been significantly affected by Obamacare's rising prices. Mr. Knox expressed optimism that President Trump will return free market principles to our Nation's healthcare system, which will benefit consumers by increasing options and lowering costs.\nMr. Joel Brown of Tennessee, a farmer whose costs for catastrophic coverage has spiked in the wake of Obamacare, from $119 per month to more than $500 per month. As a result, Mr. Brown was forced to settle for a much less desirable plan provided through his church, which cost him $280 per month.\nDr. Manny Sethi of Tennessee, founder of Healthy Tennessee, a non-profit organization designed to promote preventative healthcare. Dr. Sethi has seen first-hand Obamacare's negative effects on the medical profession. As an orthopedic trauma surgeon and Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University, Dr. Sethi is well aware of how Obamacare has harmed patient care across the country.\nDr. Robin Armstrong of Texas, a medical doctor whose wife is a breast cancer survivor. Dr. Armstrong strongly opposes Obamacare because its rising premiums and deductibles have hurt his patients. Dr. Armstrong told President Trump that he is excited about the reforms the President is pursuing, and believes they will drastically improve America's healthcare system.\nHon. Stan Summers of Utah, a local county commissioner whose family has endured significant hardship as a result of Obamacare. Mr. Summers' wife has been very sick and his son has struggled with a rare disease. Their insurance costs have skyrocketed as a result of Obamacare.\nMr. Louis Brown of Virginia, a 35-year-old attorney who currently works for the Christ Medicus Foundation, a Catholic healthcare foundation. In 2009, as Obamacare was moving through Congress, Mr. Brown was a staffer at the Democratic National Committee. He told President Trump that after much prayer and soul searching, he resigned from the DNC because he could not support a party that wanted to include taxpayer funding of abortion in Obamacare. Today, Mr. Brown supports the reforms in the American Health Care Act.\nMs. Gina Sell of Wisconsin, a young nurse who has had to work much longer hours to afford her increased health insurance premium under Obamacare. In fact, her premium now costs her more than her mortgage.\nAfter hearing these stories, President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price each committed to fighting for reforms that will bring costs down and increase access to care for all Americans.", "timestamp": "2017-03-13", "title": "Press Release - Readout of President Donald J.

He was joined by Governor Matt Bevin for a listening session with over a dozen small-business owners from Kentucky to discuss the burdens that Obamacare has inflicted on their businesses. The Kentucky business owners shared in detail how Obamacare is negatively affecting their businesses, and reiterated their support for repealing our current healthcare system and replacing with one that actually works.\nThis morning, after receiving his intelligence briefing, the President led another listening session on healthcare with Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. The President and Secretary Price heard from nine concerned Americans from across the country who have been failed by the broken promises of Obamacare, as well as two doctors who have seen their patients suffer from the law's misguided rules and requirements.\nThis listening session was another important step in the process of crafting and implementing an effective patient-centered healthcare. Americans have been watching their healthcare costs skyrocket while their choices of providers and insurers have dwindled for years.\nThey've received those cancellations in the mail as many as three times. They've seen urgent care and emergency rooms filled with people who can't afford their high deductibles and resorted to enduring the pain or sickness until they had no choice but to go to a hospital. They've had family members with chronic preexisting conditions whose cost of healthcare has more than doubled. And they've been forced to let go of valued employees or, frankly, unable to hire more due to staggering workers' compensation increases.\nThe President campaigned on a pledge to repeal and replace this unraveling system. The American Health Care Act is one part of fulfilling this pledge; it's far from the only one. He's using administrative action to provide essential regulatory relief to insurers, increasing coverage choices, and providing lower-premium options to individuals and families.\nHe will continue to work with Congress on the additional legislation, part of this three-prong strategy to increase choice while decreasing prices, including allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, adding to the list of healthcare-related costs patients conduct with their health savings accounts, streamlining the process at the FDA so that lower-priced generic medicine gets to the market faster, inviting small business to band together to negotiate for lower health insurance for all their employees, and reforming the medical malpractice lawsuit system so that doctors are not forced to perform unnecessary and costly procedures and tests out of fear of future litigation.\nOur healthcare system is large, complex, and critically important not only to the health of our citizens, but to the health of our economy. Through commonsense, patient-focused reforms, the President will work with Congress to create a new system that doesn't impose a one-size-fits-all, government-knows-best vision on the American people. We will empower the American people to make their own choices about healthcare that make them best work for themselves and their family, that will bring costs for everyone down.\nAfter the listening session, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence and Secretary of Transportation Chao. Later this afternoon, the President will welcome all of his confirmed Cabinet members to the White House for their first Cabinet meeting. This meeting is an important opportunity for the President to share his vision with the country with his Cabinet members, providing direction for them to bring back to their agencies and departments, to ensure that the entire administration is working towards the same goals.\nUnfortunately, this afternoon, you'll see some empty chairs around the table representing the President's four nominees who have yet to be confirmed by the Senate -- Secretary of Agriculture-designee Governor Perdue, Secretary of Labor-designee Alex Acosta; Director of National Intelligence-designee, former Senator Coats, and United States Trade Representative-designee, Robert Lighthizer.\nSenate Democrats have drawn out this entire process for way too long, and these key agencies and departments will not be represented at the President's first Cabinet meeting. The President is confident in these unquestionable abilities of the confirmed Cabinet members that will be in attendance. He is just as confident in the demonstrated quality of the four individuals who will not be able to attend. Their absence will clearly be felt as this administration comes together for the first time to receive guidance from, and provide counsel to, the President on these unique areas of jurisdiction.\nFollowing the Cabinet meeting, the President will sign an executive order to reorganize the federal government. This order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to identify money -- where money is being wasted and how services can be improved, and whether or not the programs are truly serving the American people.\nThis is the beginning of a long-overdue reorganization of the federal government and another significant step towards the President's often-stated goal of making it more efficient, effective and accountable to the American people.\nThis evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary of State Tillerson and National Security Advisor McMaster. Also, he hopes to see Seema Verma confirmed as the administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, another unquestionably qualified nominee who's been shamelessly prevented from taking her position at a critical post.\nLet me just kind of touch on the week ahead. Tomorrow, based on the current forecast, we are currently in conversations -- in contact with officials in the Chancellor's office in Germany regarding the visit. We'll have an update regarding that visit later today.\nOn Wednesday, the President will visit Detroit for a trip focusing on job creation and automobile manufacturing. He will meet with auto executives and workers and manufacturing suppliers highlighting the need to eliminate burdensome regulations that needlessly hinder meaningful job growth. Also on Wednesday, the President will visit Nashville, where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew Jackson's tomb at the Hermitage.\nAnd as I told you last week, on Thursday the President will welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit. I can also confirm that the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, will have a meeting with the President on Thursday of this week. I will have further details on that visit for you soon.\nAnd on Friday, the President will travel to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend.\nFinally, the President is aware of the forecast for the storm that's currently threatening the Northeast. The President has been briefed by his Homeland Security Advisor and the acting FEMA administrator on storm preparations. He has directed his Intergovernmental Affairs staff to remain in contact with governors and mayors in the path of the storm. He has directed his acting FEMA administrator to lean forward and be prepared to help states should they require federal assistance.\nWe urge everyone to listen to state and local leaders and public safety officials to follow their warning and closure notice. They are the best source of information during that storm.\nWith that, I'd be glad to take your questions.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, if I could come back to the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, who was asked to resign along with 45 other U.S. attorneys. The President seemed to indicate not too long ago that he wanted Mr. Bharara to stay on in that job, and he was asked to resign like the other attorneys. And then he says he was fired on Saturday when he refused to resign. Did the President change his mind about keeping him on? Or was it only supposed to be for a finite period of time? Can you just fill us in?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you to the Department of Justice on that. This is a standard operating procedure for a new administration around this time to ask for the resignation of all the U.S. attorneys. We had most of them -- or a good chunk of them had already submitted their resignation letter. This is just the final swath of individuals who had not at this time. But this is common practice of most administrations.\nQ: I understand that this happened at the DOJ and the request was from the DOJ, but there seems to a White House connection vis-а-vis the fact that the President had actually asked him to stay on, and then the President apparently called him a couple of days before he was allegedly fired. Can you tell us what that was all about? And did the President change his mind?\nMR. SPICER: No, the President was calling to thank him for his service. This is, as I said, a standard action that takes place at most administrations. Then-Attorney General Reno sent out an almost identical letter in 1993. The Bush administration sent out a similar one, as well. So this is a very common practice for all political appointees -- not just in the Department of Justice -- but throughout government when there's a turnover administration to ask for all individuals to do that.\nMajor.\nQ: Sean, yesterday John McCain said the President should either provide information about the allegation he put on Twitter a week ago Saturday, about his phones being tapped at Trump Tower, or retract his statement. Today is the deadline. What's the President going to do?\nMR. SPICER: Well, let's be clear -- the Department of Justice was asked to send information down to Congress. It wasn't the White House that was asked to do that. Just so we're clear as far as what the request was.\nQ: But the tweet came from the President of the United States.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And with the tweet --\nQ: Does he have an obligation, as Senator McCain said, to clear this up?\nMR. SPICER: And I think if you look at the President's tweet, he said very clearly \"wiretapping\" in quotes. There's been substantial discussion in several reports that Bret Baier from Fox on March 3rd talked about evidence of wiretapping. There's been reports in The New York Times and the BBC and other outlets about other aspects of surveillance that have occurred.\nThe President was very clear in his tweet that it was wiretapping, that that spans a whole host of surveillance types of options. The House and the Senate intelligence committees will now look into that and provide a report back. But I think that there has been numerous reports from a variety of outlets over the last couple months that seem to indicate that there has been different types of surveillance that occurred during the 2016 election.\nQ: And so what you're saying is the President doesn't have an obligation to provide any evidence?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not saying that at all. Not at all. What I'm saying is the request that was made from the House was to the Department of Justice. I think that that's an appropriate question to ask them.\nWhat I'm telling you is, from a White House perspective, there's no question that there have been an abundance of reports regarding surveillance and other type of activities that occurred during the 2016 election.\nQ: And that leads us to believe that the President's only evidence are these reports?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that leads you to believe that. I'm saying to you --\nQ: I'm trying to --\nMR. SPICER: And I'm saying to you is that what we made clear on that Sunday was that the House and Senate intelligence committees have the means, the process, and the access to go in and look at the entirety of the evidence that's being presented to them and make a determination that they can report back to us.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Following up on Major's question, does the President feel he has an obligation, once the investigation is over, to release some sort of statement in response to whatever the findings are? That's my first question. I have a second one for you.\nMR. SPICER: Well, let's get there first. I think to start to presume what the outcome is going to be before the House and the Senate look at all of the evidence and information and reports that are presented to them would be a bit presumptuous. So I think -- let's slow down a little, let them look at everything, and then let them make some determinations.\nQ: And then my second question for you: Has President Trump donated his paycheck from the month of February, like he promised to do during the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: The President's intention right now is to donate his salary at the end of the year, and he has kindly asked that you all help determine where that goes. The way that we can avoid scrutiny is to let the press corps determine where it should go. (Laughter.)\nQ: Oh, we have a few ideas.\nMR. SPICER: In all seriousness, I think his view is he made a pledge to the American people, he wants to donate it to charity. And he'd love your help to determine where it should go.\nQ: May I suggest the Correspondents Association --\nMR. SPICER: That will be a great way --\nQ: Journalism scholarship.\nMR. SPICER: That would be a great way to do it.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to follow up with you on questions regarding Michael Flynn, who's no longer in the administration. There's a five-year lobbying ban that's been imposed upon all Trump administration employees. Does that also apply to Michael Flynn? Would he not be permitted to lobby now for five years because of the agreement that he signed when he became the national security advisor?\nMR. SPICER: That would be correct. I'd have to check and actually figure out when he signed or if he signed the form. But yes, all administration officials who come in are required to sign that ethics pledge banning them from lobbying for five years and then a lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of any foreign government.\nQ: And then related to that, what are the repercussions if an employee of this administration lobbies within five years? Where's the teeth, what's the penalty, what's the punishment that would be imposed on that particular Trump administration employee?\nMR. SPICER: I'd have to get back to you, John. I don't know whether that's a Department of Justice aspect or not, but I will get back.\nYeah.\nQ: I was wondering, did the President ask Preet Bharara to stay on during their conversation during the transition or not?\nMR. SPICER: I was not privy to that conversation. Again, I'm not really sure how it's relevant at the end of the day. The Department of Justice asked all remaining 46 at this time, that they asked for all of them to submit their letters of resignation based on the same kind of precedent that was set during both the Clinton and then the Bush administrations in terms of the timeline and format.\nJessica.\nQ: I just wanted to ask about the reports about President Xi Jinping visiting Mar-a-Lago April 6th and 7th. Can you confirm that visit and talk about what you want to accomplish with that type of less formal visit? And secondly, with respect to that visit, you still don't have a confirmed ambassador, you don't have an assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Affairs. House ow does that affect your planning and ability to really properly brief the President and make sure he has a strong position?\nMR. SPICER: Planning is ongoing for a visit between President Trump and President Xi at a date to be determined. We're not ready to confirm that, and we will have more details. It's the purpose of this meeting, of that kind of a meeting, to help defuse tensions over North Korea and the recent deployment of a THAAD military battery to South Korea. Any meeting between the President of the United States and the People's Republic of China would necessarily cover a broad range of topics of mutual concern.\nSecretary Tillerson is traveling to the region now. So I think as we go forward we will have additional details on both the timing and the location of that when we go forward.\nQ: Is the implication of you saying Tillerson is traveling that he's setting up the visit, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry?\nQ: Is the implication of you talking about Tillerson's visit that he's going to be laying the groundwork for --\nMR. SPICER: Well, he's in the region. I'm sure that in his visit to Japan, South Korea and then China that preparations will come up as well as areas of mutual concern.\nQ: Sean, there's been a rash of --\nMR. SPICER: What's that?\nQ: Is it me?\nMR. SPICER: Sure. Let's go one at a time.\nQ: There's been a rash of attacks on LGBT community centers throughout the nation. Over the weekend, the community center here in D.C., Casa Ruby, was attacked and a transgender staffer was assaulted. This follows similar attacks that have taken place in recent days in Orlando, Florida, New Jersey and Oklahoma. This is not unlike the anti-Semitism that the President has already denounced. Will the President also denounce these attacks?\nMR. SPICER: Sure. I mean, I think that -- I think one of the points that we've made in previous statements on this is that this is not the way that we as Americans solve our differences. We don't attack each other. We don't engage in this kind of behavior. I think we have a First Amendment that allows us to express ourselves, and that's the appropriate way. But doing it when you're threatening violence or destruction or vandalism is inappropriate in all of its forms.\nQ: Is it connected to the withdrawal of the transgender guidance, do you think?\nMR. SPICER: Is it what?\nQ: Is it at all connected --\nMR. SPICER: I don't believe there is any connection between -- I think that that would be a stretch, to say the least.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about North Korea. You mentioned North Korea. Can you tell us a little bit about the review of North Korea right now and what direction you think the administration is going in terms of the relationship -- trying to manage the threat from North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned, Secretary Tillerson is heading to the region. He'll meet with his counterparts in South Korea, Japan, and then ultimately in Beijing. That's obviously going to be a major subject. And as I mentioned, when we ultimately meet with President Xi and others, that will be a discussion; it's something that's he's talked about prior to the resignation of the last South Korean President, and was something that has been part of an ongoing discussion.\nSo there's an internal review that we continue to have, but then there's obviously a geopolitical conversation we're having with partners in the region as we look to contain North Korea's military threat.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Can you confirm that any cooperation with Russia with regard to Syria is off the table? And if not, is it fair to say that the forthcoming anti-ISIS plan does include some sort of cooperation with Russia?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what the plan -- I mean, the plan is not done yet. As I mentioned a couple days ago, Secretary Mattis was briefing the principals, and that plan is continuing to evolve. So I'm not going to start to rule out one country. But I think the President has been very clear in the past that if a country shares our commitment to defeating ISIS and we can work with them in an area of shared, mutual concern, then we will do so.\nQ: Second question. A Kremlin spokesperson said that Russian President Putin and President Trump will meet at the G-20. Can you confirm that? And would the White House move on a possibility of a meeting before that?\nMR. SPICER: I will follow up on that. I don't have a date. I know that the team is working very actively with respect to bilateral meetings at the G20. I don't have anything for you on that.\nRoberta.\nQ: Director Mulvaney said yesterday that he felt that the Obama administration had been manipulating the unemployment rate. I'm wondering if that's a view that the President shares. And what evidence is there of --\nMR. SPICER: I think he was clearly referring to Obamacare, the number of people. But I would refer you back to him and his comments with respect to how he characterized that. I think he can discuss the precise nature of what he meant on that.\nQ: Does the President feel that the Obama administration had been manipulating --\nMR. SPICER: I think you know what the President's view is. He's made very clear in the past what his comments were on how those numbers were articulated in the past. And I think there's a question between the total number of people that are employed, and the President's comments in the past have reflected that his big concern was getting to the bottom of how many people are working in this country, and that the denominator -- meaning the percentage rate of the total number of people -- is not the most accurate reflection of how many people are employed in this country. How many jobs are created, how many people are getting back to work, how many companies are committing to hiring more people is a much more accurate assessment of where we're headed as our country -- where our employment is, where our economy is headed.\nBut to look at a number and say we have 4.7 or 4.8 or 5.9 percent unemployment is not necessarily an accurate reflection of how many people are actually working, seeking work, or want to work. And if you know how they conduct those surveys, there's a lot of times when people, whether they're older or younger, or because of how long they've been searching for work, are not considered statistically viable anymore and they're washed away.\nSo I think how you look at the percentage of people working can sometimes be a manipulated number. The number of people that are added to the roll every year -- every month, rather -- is a much more accurate understanding of what's happening in the economy.\nCecilia.\nQ: I just want to clarify your answer to Major's question. So will the DOJ and/or the administration comply with the deadline to supply information today?\nMR. SPICER: Remember, it's the -- again, it's not -- the request was made of the DOJ, and so the proper venue to ask that question of is the Department of Justice.\nQ: But surely, the White House knows whether there is or there is not evidence.\nMR. SPICER: You can't -- because, it's interesting, in the past whenever we've had these conversations with another agency, the accusation from the press corps is that we're interfering in something. So you can't have it both ways. You can't say that we're interfering with someone when we talk to them; when we don't talk to them, it's \"surely you must know.\" So --\nQ: So if the President tweets something --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, Cecilia is asking a question.\nQ: -- and then say it's the Department Justice's obligation --\nQ: This is to follow up on --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. I saw the tick-tock. I understand it. That doesn't mean you get to jump in.\nCecilia.\nQ: So to follow up on Major's point, though, this is a tweet from the President. Doesn't the President have an obligation --\nMR. SPICER: And he does, and I think we've made it very --\nQ: -- to make the evidence clear?\nMR. SPICER: Right, and we've made it very clear that we expect the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees to do their job. I think there's a preponderance of reports that continues to come out about surveillance and actions that have occurred during the 2016 election. Once they come up with their report -- and it was asked earlier today -- I think we can talk about the conclusions of that report. But at this time, you can't say that we're going to shift it off to the House and Senate and then comment every day. That was the entire goal of asking them to look into this further.\nQ: But will DOJ comply with this deadline today? The clock is ticking.\nQ: The President instructed them --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. My understanding is that they will. But again, I would ask them what their intention is, and I believe there are certain things that they can and can't do in terms of classification and stuff. But I would leave it up to the Department of Justice to answer for the Department of Justice.\nKaitlan.\nQ: How is the press making Obamacare look good?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think when you see some of these comparisons that occur in the -- talk about who's going to win and who's going to lose, it misses a lot of the competition that's going to take place. It doesn't talk about the increased choice.\nRight now, as the President has noted, as Secretary Price has noted, in a third of all counties in five states you have one choice. Those analyses that are very -- trying to look at how much you'll pay and how much you won't, A, don't take into consideration the competition that's going to occur, the choice that's going to occur.\nI mean, right now, you have one choice in a lot of places. You have no decision about how much you're going to pay and what you're going to get. Choice allows you to determine what scale of healthcare you need, what kind of package is good for you, your family or for your business. And when you look at a lot of these analyses when you open up various major papers, they make it seem so simple: it's how much are you going to pay for on this plan, how much are you going to pay for under the current plan. It misses an entirety of the whole process, which is that you don't have competition, number one.\nNumber two, and the bigger point that I think the President and a lot of others are getting to, is that the system is failing on its own. It makes it seem like it's all rainbows and puppies. At the end of the day, if you have a card and you're getting a subsidy but you're not getting care, you have nothing.\nAnd so walking into a doctor's office where you can hand them a card and say, I've got a $5,000 tax subsidy -- if that doctor doesn't take the care or the deductible is so high, then you really don't have anything. And so to do an apples-to-apples comparison is hardly an accurate analysis of what the current situation is.\nZeke.\nQ: Just going back to the counter-ISIS plan you mentioned earlier, the plan isn't don't yet. The President during the campaign said multiple times that within 30 days he wanted that plan presented to him. Obviously it's undergoing comments at the National Security Council principals level. But is the President upset that he hasn't received it yet? And does that point to a difference between campaigning and governing, that things take longer than he thought?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think there's a difference. The plan has been received, right. The issue, as you correctly point out in your question, is that now that it becomes an aspect of the principals all discussing different priorities, different staffing levels, different funding levels. But the plan is here, as we noted a few weeks ago. It's being reviewed, and they're providing input from different members of the principals and different members of his national security apparatus to make sure that the plan continues to evolve and is able to attack ISIS in a way that --\nQ: When is it actually going to take effect?\nMR. SPICER: Some pieces of it are, in the sense of -- he has talked to commanders on the ground. We've noted before some of the military action that's been taken, some of the authority that's been given to some of the commanders on the ground. That is actually taking the fight to ISIS on a daily basis. I think the more holistic approach that he asked for will continue to evolve through the national security process. But make no mistake, we're on it right now.\nSharon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On the executive order this afternoon, do you have a numeric goal for either reducing the size of government or saving a certain amount of money through the review of agencies?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that Director Mulvaney has a target, per se. I think that's part of the issue, is that you go through each one of these and you evaluate them on the merit of what they do or don't do, or whether or not they've become bloated or duplicative, or, frankly, just outdated or in need of technological advances.\nBut there's a lot of -- there's no set number that we're driving down to as we review government. Sometimes you just walk into an agency and you realize that agency's mission is no longer relevant, or that it's duplicative in three other agencies, or that there are too many people performing a function that no longer exists for a variety of reasons. But that's why the mission is critical that Director Mulvaney was given the mandate to go out and get all of these different agencies and departments to review themselves and to provide feedback for him as to where we could go.\nGabi.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You had said previously that the Republican healthcare plan wouldn't be a one-size-fits-all approach, but the current plan preserves Obamacare's health benefits requirements, which literally defines insurance at the federal level. So how do you reconcile those two things?\nMR. SPICER: What's missing right now is choice. That's the number-one issue. We tried to solve a problem -- when I say \"we,\" the government -- with respect to Obamacare back in 2008, 2009. And the issue was, is that in order to solve a problem for several million people being without healthcare insurance, we upended the system for everybody -- so if you had employer-based healthcare, if you had TRICARE, Medicare or Medicaid. And it was exactly the opposite approach. We went in to solve a problem that a small fraction of Americans had, and we upended the entire system, forcing premiums to go up and choice to go down for everybody.\nAnd I think that when you can institute choice and competition back in the system, that's something that's going to benefit everybody. And that's exactly the opposite of what's happening.\nQ: Would phase two or three of this eliminate those requirements?\nMR. SPICER: I think phase two, the administrative phase, will look at a lot of those requirements, and then phase three -- and again, they're not necessarily -- they can run concurrently, and I think the House is looking at starting a lot of that legislation.\nAnd so -- and Dr. Price is already starting to look through a lot of that administration -- a lot of administrative aspects of it as well at HHS and figure out how do we start to achieve some of this, unravel some of these pieces that are there, but instilling choice and competition, allowing people to buy their insurance over state lines, allowing small businesses to pool, allowing the expansion of health savings accounts -- all of those kind of factors that are going to drive down costs, but also having the insurance companies, frankly, be able to offer additional choices and options for people is in itself going to be a huge bonus.\nCharlie.\nQ: A lot of conservatives are complaining that -- or suggesting that the President doesn't fully back the Paul Ryan healthcare plan. Has the President spoken with Paul Ryan about the plan? And have they had any conversations about its future in Congress?\nMR. SPICER: They have spoken, yes. I don't know when the last time they have. But the President is fully committed to this plan. I think you saw Secretary Price and Director Mulvaney out discussing that this weekend. They're committed to the plan.\nAnd, look, Director Mulvaney made it very clear this weekend as well that if through the process we can find some ideas that make this a stronger, more patient-centered piece of legislation that will ultimately benefit Americans, then we're going to do it. We're not saying this is the only way forward. As it works its way through the House and then ultimately through the Senate, if there are ways that we can enhance the bill through the legislative process, we're willing to do that.\nPeter.\nQ: You want to read us another -- quickly -- if there's any details of the --\nMR. SPICER: Would you like to know? (Laughter.)\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, thank you. The President spoke to the Chancellor of Germany. They agreed, due to the current weather, that the meeting should be postponed. The meeting has been rescheduled to March 17th, this Friday. Same schedule of events on March 17th.\nQ: All right, I'll ask my question if I can very quickly then.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you for your assistance with the --\nQ: That's news. You spoke on behalf of the President, quoting him on the jobs report on Friday. You said they \"may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now.\"\nMR. SPICER: They are very real now.\nQ: \"They are very real now.\"\nMR. SPICER: Just want to make sure you get it right.\nQ: The question I wanted -- when should Americans trust the President? Should they trust the President -- is it phony or real when he says that President Obama was wiretapping him?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, let's get back. I think there's two things that are important about what he said. I think recognizing that it's -- he doesn't really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally.\nQ: What does he think?\nMR. SPICER: But I think there's no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election. That is a widely reported activity that occurred back then. The President used the word \"wiretap\" to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities during that. And that is, again, something -- it is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now we're wondering where the proof is. It is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back then.\nQ: So on the same topic, on the CBO report, did the President think it was real then, and is phony now?\nMR. SPICER: What CBO report?\nQ: On the expectation -- the CBO report is coming out, about which you said, \"If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place.\" Three years ago, you said of the CBO report, that it confirms Obamacare is bad for the economy. So the question is --\nMR. SPICER: Well, it was bad for the economy.\nQ: Okay, so the bottom line of the question is, was it real then, and now is now phony? As you have said, it's not the place to find accuracy?\nMR. SPICER: Okay, so let's look at the CBO's projection. It said their projection on Obamacare was that, in 2016, it would have 24 million people on it. The actual figure is 10.4 million people -- less than half the number of people that it predicted would be insured were on it, and it's declining.\nSo the only point, Peter, is to make sure that people understand -- if you're looking to get a bullseye accurate prediction as to where it's going, the CBO was off by more than half last time. So it's not -- this is not about what my understanding or my belief of the CBO is. The last time they did this they were wildly off, and the number keeps declining.\nAnd so the question that needs to get asked right now, or, frankly, the awareness that needs to be brought up right now is that if you were going to look at a number tonight, I think you have to look through the scope of whether or not that number is.\nNow, it was bad for the economy. That was right. You can glean that in terms of the direction what the impact that it had. But as far as their numbers go -- on the number of people that they predicted back then would be covered now -- they were off by more than half.\nQ: I guess the question is, when can we trust the President when he says something is phony and when he says it's real?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. You asked a question about CBO, and now you're conflating it with the question of the President. The question is --\nQ: No, I asked a question about wiretapping first. And then we went on to CBO. So the question, in simple terms is, when he says something, can we trust that it's real --\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: -- or should we assume that it's phony? Well, no, no --\nMR. SPICER: You suggest that it's real, absolutely.\nQ: How can we believe that it's real when you just told us that it was phony then, but now it's real?\nMR. SPICER: I did not tell you that, Peter. And you're trying --\nQ: You told us on Friday that the President said -- the President, you didn't -- the President said the numbers were phony then but they're very real now. So how can we take anything he says that he won't later say, \"actually it was the opposite\"?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. I think the difference is, the President was talking then and now about job creation -- the number of jobs. The issue that he brought up in the quote that you're talking about was the percentage of people who are unemployed. And there is no question that no matter how you look at this, whether you talk about 4.7 or 4.8 or whatever the number is, that number fluctuates by how people calculate who is in the workforce.\nQ: He said it was in the twenties or more.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, Peter, let me answer the question.\nQ: I'm listening.\nMR. SPICER: You're not. Let me answer it. The bottom line is, the percentage of people who are unemployed varies widely by who you're asking and the way you do the analysis of who is actually in the workforce. The number of people who are working and receiving a paycheck is a number that we can look at.\nSecondly, when you're asking about the validity of the CBO report, again, I would refer you to the CBO itself. The number that they issued that would be insured in 2016 was 26 million people. The actual number is 10 -- excuse me, 24 million. The actual number is 10.4. That's not a question of our credibility. It's a question of theirs.\nDo you have anything more? (Laughter.)\nQ: The bottom line is, the question that you still have not answered is --\nMR. SPICER: I have answered it.\nQ: -- can you say affirmatively that whenever the President says something, we can trust it to be real?\nMR. SPICER: If he's not joking, of course. But in that case --\nQ: So let's start over again with joking.\nMR. SPICER: But you're asking -- hold on -- okay, no, no. But your point is -- I mean, every time that he speaks authoritatively -- that he speaks -- that he is speaking as President of the United States. Like it's --\nQ: Three to five -- more than 3 million Americans voted illegally -- was that, when he was speaking --\nMR. SPICER: Yes. And he still believes that.\nQ: -- was he joking or does he believe it?\nMR. SPICER: He does believe it. Thank you.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I have a healthcare question. But first, can we just get an answer one way or the other about whether the President directed the Department of Justice to respond to this?\nMR. SPICER: No, he did not.\nQ: And does he plan to?\nMR. SPICER: I answered the question.\nQ: Okay, so on healthcare, Secretary Price said on Sunday that nobody will be worse off financially and more people will be covered than are currently with the plan that you guys are pushing. Paul Ryan acknowledged that people are going to lose coverage. So what is the goal here? You just said you're open to modifications to the plan if you find that there's a better way to do it. Is the goal that people not lose coverage? Or is the goal that --\nMR. SPICER: Well, again -- but there's a false argument there which is that they have coverage. People have cards, they've been told they have things, but they can't -- they keep walking in -- the President met with nine individuals this morning that they were told they're going to get coverage for something, they are told that they're going to have all these subsidies. They walk in, and they don't get covered. They don't have the care that they need. There is a difference between walking around with someone and saying, hey, I've got a card, than I have care. And that is a big, big difference.\nRight now, when you have a third of the counties in this country that have one choice and going down, and number of insurers leaving markets, then the system is collapsing. So the question has to be, to everybody who is not with us on this, is what is your alternative? Because right now, the current system of Obamacare is failing every American who has Obamacare. And frankly, for those who don't have Obamacare, for those who have employer-based insurance, for those who have TRICARE or Medicare, it's driving up the costs. And in the cases, especially for those who have Medicaid, Medicare, or TRICEARE, they're going into doctors' offices more and more who are telling them, we don't accept that.\nQ: But you're talking about quality and about cost. I'm asking about coverage.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, but that's the point, is that you're missing the point. If you keep talking about coverage -- care is what matters. If you can't walk in and get seen, if you can't get a doctor to see you, then you don't have coverage. I mean, that's what this is all about. Being told you have coverage but you can't go see a doctor, or you can't afford to see a doctor is not coverage.\nJohn Gizzi.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions. First, Democratic Leader Pelosi said on Friday that every single Democrat would vote against the American healthcare plan -- the plan backed by Republican members of Congress and the administration. The Freedom Caucus in the House has come out for Senator Paul's plan. When one simply does the arithmetic of Democratic members and Freedom Caucus members, that's a majority against the plan. How does the administration plan to overcome the arithmetic?\nMR. SPICER: We're going to continue to work with members of the House and then eventually the Senate. I feel very good, as the President continues to engage with members, that we will have the votes necessary. I think Speaker Ryan agrees with that as well. We're going to have the votes, this thing will pass, and we'll move on to the Senate.\nQ: The other question is this: In recent weeks there's been considerable attention on the upcoming elections in the Netherlands on Wednesday, and in France in a few weeks. Candidate Geert Wilders of the Netherlands was here for the CPAC conference. Representatives of Marine Le Pen of France were here. Many analogies were made between these candidates and President Trump, and they offered words of praise for him or did so through their representatives. Is he aware of these candidates in Europe who invoke his name and image? And if so, what does he think of these would-be Trumps and Trumpettes?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that. I think most of these are -- we'll allow sovereign nations to have their own elections without interference.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, can I follow up on Peter and Julie's questions?\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: Two issues, again. Whether the President and Director Mulvaney put a lot of faith in the Congressional Budget Office, members of the Senate will, when they get -- if they get legislation from the House. So my question is, what does the President or the administration intend to do to establish to senators' satisfaction that the numbers coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, which the President will question, are not substantial and can be countered by other information? In other words, is OMB doing its own kind of score? Is the President relying on a think tank to counter the messaging? Because senators are already indicating that they will put weight in the CBO's score.\nMR. SPICER: And again, I think this is part of an ongoing discussion with members as far as philosophical, what do they believe, and a lot of these aspects of this plan in keeping with what they have supported in the past.\nObviously, they're going to look at the score -- I get it. That's part of it. And there are pieces of it that may historically have more weighted than others. But I think this is going to be -- as I mentioned to John, I mean, it's an ongoing conversation with members of the House and ultimately the Senate with respect to whatever comes out.\nBut in the same way that members relied on the score last time, they were way off. And I think that we have to remind them that if this is what you're basing your vote on, you have to look at the historical context in which that information was provided. I think that's an important aspect to how they do it. But I think there's going to be a ton of factors that people rely on as they do this.\nQ: Can I follow -- I have one follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: I may be confused about the wiretapping, your answers, in terms of the President's response. The President was the one who tweeted this, right, and said that he learned something. So can you just establish for me, because I'm confused, the President did discuss what it is that he had in mind, what he tweeted, with the Department of Justice before the Department 00\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not going to get into what the President knew or didn't know prior to it. I think we've already commented on this multiple times.\nQ: But how would the Department of Justice have any idea --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. This was a request made of the House Intelligence Committee, not to us. So I don't want to get into starting to parse what we knew or what we didn't. That request did not come to us, it went to the Department of Justice.\nYes.\nQ: Congressman Steve King (inaudible) a tweet he put up, saying that, \"We can't restore civilization with somebody else's babies.\" Does the White House have any reaction to that?\nMR. SPICER: I will definitely touch base with the President on that and get back to you on that.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, two for you. I just want to go back to something. You just said a minute ago that \"what the President meant when he tweeted about the wiretapping was\" -- and you sort of explained it. But you've also stood at that podium and said the tweet speaks for itself. When do you decide when a President's tweets, when his words are open to interpretation and when those words stand on their own?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, can you further explain what you're asking? I mean, his tweets do speak for themselves.\nQ: You just sort of interpreted it for Peter, saying, well, he didn't mean that President Obama had --\nMR. SPICER: That's not what I said. No, no, actually --\nQ: You said when he meant wiretapping -- said it -- he meant surveillance. That's not what he said.\nMR. SPICER: He literally had it in quotes.\nQ: So you're interpreting the tweet for us, it sounds like.\nMR. SPICER: No, in some cases I'll ask him, what did the quotes mean, and he'll say --\nQ: Did you ask about this tweet?\nMR. SPICER: I did.\nQ: And what did he say?\nMR. SPICER: He said they were in quotes, I was referring to surveillance overall. It's something that had been referred to in other reports.\nQ: So he cited other reports in his conversation with you?\nMR. SPICER: He did, yes.\nQ: So was that what he was basing that tweet on?\nMR. SPICER: As I just mentioned -- it was a good try, but I've already been clear on that.\nQ: I have a second for you, Sean. I want to go back to this healthcare idea. Just yes or no: Are CBO numbers legitimate, or not?\nMR. SPICER: That's not my determination to make. I'm telling --\nQ: Does the President think those numbers are legitimate?\nMR. SPICER: Hallie, it depends. There are a lot of things at -- hold on, Hallie. You guys have like an NBC thing. Let me answer the question. I think when you look at whatever that number is, whether it's budget projections or whatever, I think there's a track record that goes along a lot of times with whether or not the projections in certain areas -- whether it's unemployment, budgetary numbers, whatever -- what the track record is.\nAll I'm suggesting to you is very clearly that the numbers that they gave the last time they did health care were off by more than 50 percent when it came to the number of people insured. That's not my interpretation, that's a fact. And I think it's important for people to understand the differences.\nEamon.\nQ: Sean, on Preet Bharara, I guess there are two possibilities here. One is the President made a commitment to keep him back in November, and the other one is that he didn't. Preet Bharara came down to the lobby of Trump Tower and said that the President had made that commitment. Did the President, in fact, make that commitment to Preet Bharara?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think it really matters. At the end of the day, the Attorney General followed a practice that existed for the last several administrations and asked every attorney general in the last administration to submit their resignation. So, I mean, it is --\nQ: It matters in ongoing investigations, and it also matters in the sense that the President made a commitment. If he made a commitment, why did he change his mind? Why did he go back on it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, he called him to thank him for his service last week. He followed in the past practice of last several administration and asked everybody to step down. And I think that's the appropriate thing.\nQ: Sean, but what's changed from November to now?\nMR. SPICER: I called on someone.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Ronica Cleary from Fox 5, thank you. I have two questions. The first, I think especially in light of what has happened in the room here today, the President tweeted this morning that much of the media is being rude and that we should be nice. So my question is, is it our job to be nice? And do you think we're nice? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Ronica. I will just leave it at this. I think that I've been asked for my personal opinion several times. That's not my job. I don't get up here to speak for myself. I speak for the President. I think that he has been very clear that he doesn't believe some of the behavior and the reporting has been appropriate. And to Hallie's point, I will let the tweet speak for itself.\nRonica, number two.\nQ: Second question. But this is about you. The interaction you had at the Apple store this weekend -- what would be, I guess, your message to individuals who want to maybe -- I see that woman was, you could argue, very aggressive. If somebody doesn't want to be aggressive and has a question for you, what would you be your kind of message to a regular citizen that has an issue?\nMR. SPICER: Ask it. I interact with individuals all day long. Ninety-nine percent of them are pleasant, even with people who may not agree with our philosophy or programs or whatever. But it's a free country, and the beauty of it is that people can act how they want, no matter how that's interpreted. And as long as they stay on the right side of the First Amendment, we're good.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. You said that when the President said wiretapping in that tweet he meant a whole host of surveillance types. So that we can be crystal clear, what surveillance types was he referring to then? What would you consider part of that range?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think there's a whole host of tactics that can be used to monitor somebody -- either through wiretap or other ways in which you can surveil somebody.\nQ: We took that to mean monitoring his calls, specifically. So what else would you include in that range?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a whole host of things that fall into that category. So I'm not sure how you took it, but there is a wide range of ways in which somebody can be monitored or followed up on. And I think that if you contacted one of the law enforcement agencies, they will provide you with a whole host of ways.\nThank you, all. Be safe tomorrow with the snow. Thank you very much. Take care. Stay safe.\nEND 2:06 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-13", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:27 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Martha Armstrong, wife of Dr. Armstrong. Mr. Brown referred to former Rep. Daniel E. Lungren. Ms. Sell referred to Sen. Ronald H. Johnson.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123528", "text": "The President. Well, thank you all for being here today. It's a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law. Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a health care plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone.\nYou represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digit and even triple digits. In Arizona, the rates are over 116 percent last year—116 percent increase. And the deductibles are so high, you don't even get to use it.\nMany Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties—think of it, one-third—only have one insurer left. I mean, the insurance companies are fleeing. They're gone, so many gone. The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices—far more choices at lower cost. Americans should pick the plan they want. Now they'll be able to pick the plan they want; they'll be able to pick the doctor they want. They'll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave. You don't pick your doctor, you don't pick your plan—you remember that one.\nWe're not going to have one-size-fits-all. Instead, we're going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business. And you'll see rates go down, down, down, and you'll see plans go up, up, up. You'll have a lot of choices.\nYou'll have plans that nobody is even thinking of today. They will have plans that today nobody has even thought about, because the market is going to enforce that, with millions and millions of people wanting health care. More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down very significantly. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there, because you have to let that marketplace kick in, and it's going to take a little while to get there. Once it does, it's going to be a thing of beauty. I wish it didn't take a year and 2 years, but that's what's going to happen, and that's the way it works. But we're willing to go through that process.\nWorking together, we'll get the job done. And I have to say this just in closing, and then I want to hear some of your stories, and we'll let the press stay for your stories if you like. But the press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden. I'm watching the news—looks so good. They're showing these reports about \"this one gets so much and this one gets so much.\"\nFirst of all, it covers very few people. And it's imploding. And '17 will be the worst year. And I said it once, I'll say it again—because Obama is gone, he—things are going to be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare. They're going to have tremendous increases. And the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position— I tell this to Tom Price all the time—by repealing Obamacare—because people aren't going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare. They're not going to see the devastation in '17 and '18 and '19. It'll be gone by then; it will be—whether we do it or not, it will be imploded off the map.\nSo the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we end it, everyone is going to say, \"Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be, remember how wonderful it used to be, it was so great.\" It's a little bit like President Obama. When he left, people liked him. When he was here, people didn't like him so much. That's the way life goes. That's human nature.\nThe fact is, Obamacare is a disaster. And by—and I say this to the Republicans all the time: By repealing it, by getting rid of it, by ending it, everyone is going to say, \"Oh, it used to be so great.\" But it wasn't great. And I tell Tom Price, and I tell Paul Ryan, I tell every one of them—I say, the best thing you can do politically is wait a year, because it's going to blow itself off the map. But that's the wrong thing to do for the country; it's the wrong thing to do for our citizens.\nSo with that, I'd like to introduce some of the folks, and you could say a few words about your experience with Obamacare. And perhaps the press will even report it. [Laughter]\nWould you like to start?\nRifle, CO, resident Carrie D. Couey. Yes.\nThe President. Good.\nMs. Couey. Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you.\nMs. Couey. Our rates are three times they were before Obamacare started. We have one provider in our county. We have very little options for what we can and cannot do. We're a small-business owner; we're actually not a brick and mortar, we are cattle ranchers. We can't afford our equipment if we're paying these rates year after year after year.\nOur food source is in jeopardy because of this health care law. It's my basic——\nThe President. I know. It's all right. Don't worry. Don't worry. This is what's happening. It's gone up three times, and then you have to pay—if you don't want to use it, you have to pay. That's the alltime beauty. If you don't want to use it, you have to pay. And, Tom, you have to pay big league, right? So people say, well, if I use it, I use it, I'm paying too much. If I don't use it, I have to pay a penalty. And do you ever pay penalties? Do you ever do that, or you have to——\nMs. Couey. We haven't as of yet, but we were uninsured in December. They dropped us for the fourth time, after we paid over $50,000 last year for health care expenses.\nThe President. And it's gone up triple.\nMs. Couey. Yes.\nThe President. And before Obamacare, you actually had good health care.\nMs. Couey. We did. We had a fantastic plan.\nThe President. Yes. A lot of people—nobody ever takes that into account. I'm not saying the system before was good, because it wasn't, but millions of people had great health care that they loved. Now, when you start deducting those millions of people from the so-called people that are happy, you have a very small number of people that are happy. That I can tell you.\nHow about you?\nToccoa, GA, resident Brittany Ivey Well, we're kind of the same story as Carrie. In 2009, I left a full-time job to be a stay-at-home mom to two kids. For our family, it was never an option to get government assistance; we just don't believe our neighbors should work harder so that we don't have to. So my husband said, if you can pay for our insurance—which at the time was $650 a month for private health insurance for a family of four—then that was fine.\nFrom 2009 to 2015, that private insurance went up by 102 percent. Finally, his employer told us in 2015, when it went up the final time an additional 34 percent, that they couldn't carry our family anymore, so I had to enter back into the workforce, but I couldn't find a job that offered health insurance. So we entered the—under Obamacare, and we believed the sales pitch that, \"If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\"\nSo even though we were going to have to pay $1,300 a month for Obamacare, we thought we'd still be okay with our doctors. We were on it for 5 months. Our pediatrician for our children wouldn't take it, my doctor wouldn't take it, so we paid them $8,000 in 5 months and were never able to use it.\nAnd I think what makes our family story unique is, we're by no means wealthy. In 2014, when we entered the exchange, we made $53,000 as a family, my husband and I together—that was our gross income. And then, in 2015, we made together—since I had gone back to work—$74,000. But when you look at paying $10,000 in health premiums and insurance—and health costs——\nThe President. So it's been a rough go.\nMs. Ivey. It has, it's been hard.\nThe President. How have you found Obamacare?\nMs. Ivey. It's—we'll be so happy to see it gone. I mean I just— it's almost put our family in financial ruin, and I think that's the story for a lot of people.\nThe President. It's put businesses in financial ruin.\nMs. Ivey. That's right.\nThe President. It's one of the biggest costs—it has been disastrous for businesses.\nGo ahead, sir.\nMiami, FL, resident Elias A. Seife. Yes, first of all, Mr. President, thank you for having us here.\nThe President. Thank you, thank you.\nMr. Seife. I think it's a great opportunity to tell the American people, people like ourselves that have struggled with the health care law.\nI myself am from Miami. I haven't had very much time to prepare, but the President of the United States calls, and I'm here. For you and—[laughter]. So I—it just so happened, I had—every single year for the past couple of years, I've had a different insurance every single year. Before, I had an individual plan, my wife and I—my wife is an attorney, I'm a computer programmer; I'm a small business; my wife is a small business. And I just don't understand what happened. We have a daughter with a disability. We've changed our plan every year.\nThe President. So your insurance was good before Obamacare.\nMr. Seife. Oh, absolutely. I was never—I never had——\nThe President. Many people are like that. Many, many plans were great before Obamacare. They were so happy. And that doesn't justify the system before Obamacare, but people are miserable now, and it's putting people out of business, and it's putting them in the poorhouse.\nGo ahead.\nMr. Seife. It's just that we had to—they cancelled our plans, and I couldn't understand why they cancelled our plans. So we had no other choice. I remember the President of the United States say that individual plans will not be covered, you need to have an employer-based plan. If you—I do not work for the government; I do not work for a large employer.\nThe President. Very unfair.\nMr. Seife. We are the—we are ground zero. My case is ground zero for the health care law.\nThe President. And you represent a lot of people in the same situation.\nMr. Seife. Absolutely.\nThe President. It's very unfair.\nMr. Seife. Like my friend here, she's in the same situation. And I think it's very, very unfair. And I think that the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode——\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Seife. ——like you were saying. And my parents are from—came from communist Cuba; they know what socialism is all about. So I know what socialism is, and that's pretty much what—this whole system was meant to have one single provider.\nThe President. Well, it turns out, it's so expensive it's almost not socialism when you think about it. [Laughter] You have to pay so much.\nWhat do you think? Go ahead.\nPhoenix, AZ, resident Kim Sertich. I'm from Arizona, and I can tell you that the 116-percent increase is real; it's not a myth. I lost my plan three times during the Obamacare era. After losing it this year I decided to opt out. So right now I do not have traditional health care.\nAnd I was—went from my $365-a-month premium last year to a $809 premium this year.\nThe President. And a higher deductible.\nMs. Sertich. The deductible was going to be $6,800, no copays. So if I went to the doctor, I would be paying out of my pocket, and it just didn't seem like a good use of my money. I felt like I would be a better steward of that $17,000 at the end of the year should I have released my deductible, and just decided to opt out. I went into a faith-based share program, and I'm doing that.\nOne of the reasons I felt like I can do this—we totally are taking a leap of faith—— The President. Right.\nMs. Sertich. ——is because I think—I know you're going to get this taken care of. So I thought it's only going to be for a year. I will be on my—this program, I will opt out of traditional health care, or health insurance. And I think you're going to get it done.\nThe President. You have a lot of people in Arizona paying a big penalty?\nMs. Sertich. Yes and——\nThe President. You're paying the penalty?\nMs. Sertich. ——well, and my husband also owns his own business and doesn't—can't afford to offer insurance to employees. And his employees who are also in the independent market, it's just getting too much. And I've had individual insurance for 25 years, since I started my business. So I've always been in that individual market; I've always done what was right. Take—I took responsibility for myself, made sure I was covered for health care because I'm a businessperson, I don't want any huge health care expenses to affect the money that could be going to my business now having to go to a health expense.\nSo I was in my mid-20s when I said, you know what, I've got to get—we've always got to get square with this, I have to have independent insurance. So, I have.\nThe President. Well, thank you very much.\nMs. Sertich. Until this year.\nThe President. The people of Arizona have been hit very, very hard. At least 116 percent. Here's the bad news: It's going to go up more this year. Now, if we repeal it, nobody is going to know that, and the press is going to say how wonderful it was, and, gee, we miss Obamacare. That's the problem. It's the biggest problem I have, Tom.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Thomas E. Price. Exactly.\nThe President. We're going to do them a big favor, but it's not the right way.\nGo ahead.\nChrist Medicus Foundation Director Louis Brown. Mr. President, thank you.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much, Louis.\nMr. Brown. Name is Louis Brown. I work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. I'm an attorney by training. In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was going through Congress—what became the Affordable Care Act—I was working for the Democratic National Committee at the time. I resigned my position because I could tell that the Democratic bill that was going through Congress wanted to publicly fund abortion, and that's not something that I could go along with. So I resigned my position, later worked for Congressman Dan Lungren in Congress, and went on to eventually work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. And we're focused on building a culture of life, protecting religious liberty in health care, protecting the right of conscience, prohibiting the public funding of abortion, and also prohibiting nondiscrimination against pro-life medical providers.\nI—especially as an African American, I'm a graduate of Howard University School of Law——\nThe President. Good school. Mr. Brown. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. And I know from Saint John Paul II—he said that all of our human and civil rights that we believe in as Americans, that we share as Americans—the right to health care, the right to medical care, to housing, to all of these different things—are illusory if the right to life isn't defended with maximum determination.\nSeventeen million African Americans, it's shown, that probably have been aborted since Roe v. Wade. And I supported you in the Presidential election——\nThe President. Thank you.\nMr. Brown. ——gave several speeches in Michigan telling folks to vote pro-life in the general election, and really happy that you're here to continue the bipartisan belief that there should be no taxpayer funding of abortion, and also really to support your effort to show that the patient, the human person, should be at the center of our American health care system, not the Government. The Government has its place, but the patient should be the center. So I'm happy to support you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you. That's so nice, Louis. Thank you, I appreciate it. Great job.\nYes, go ahead.\nHealthy Tennessee Cofounder Dr. Manish K. \"Manny\" Sethi. Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting me. My name is Dr. Manny, and I run a nonprofit called Healthy Tennessee, in—across Tennessee, I'm a trauma surgeon. But what we do is——\nThe President. I'll be in Tennessee on Wednesday. [Laughter]\nDr. Sethi. We look forward to hosting you, sir.\nThe President. I'll see you there.\nDr. Sethi. Yes, sir. We do these large community events where, in rural Appalachia, across Tennessee, where we host these health fairs taking care of patients. So it's really a grassroots effort—something that you understand better than anybody—where people come out just to help people: doctors, nurses on the ground, helping folks with preventative medicine, educating folks. That's what we do.\nBut the one thing I've been seeing across Tennessee is that folks really can't afford these rising premiums. So what they're doing is, effectively, they're paying the tax penalty, and they're not—because it's cheaper and it works out better than paying for the insurance. And so that's been a big problem that we're seeing across the State. So thank you so much for what you're doing to tackle this problem.\nThe President. So you've seen a big problem, and the way out of the problem is to do a plan much more like the plan we're going to get done.\nDr. Sethi. Yes, sir.\nThe President. We'll get that out. We will get that out, without penalties too, by the way. People don't mention all of the facts.\nYou know, the other thing about what we're talking about—we really have a three-phase plan. They only want to talk about the first phase. The first phase is just the most basic of phases, and then you have phase two, which is largely done by our Secretary, and then you have phase three, which is a lot of the bells and whistles. But they don't want to talk about the bells and whistles. So they're really comparing things to something that won't be there for long. And the reason we have to do it that way is because of Congress. I'd love to do it all in one package, but if you did it that way, it can't get done. So we're going to get something done that's going to be terrific.\nI appreciate it. Thank you, doctor, very much.\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\nFriendship, TN, resident Joel L. Brown. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I, too, am from Tennessee, and I, too, am from in the farming industry.\nThe President. Good.\nMr. Brown. And the fate that I've had through Obamacare is my wife and my daughter's insurance is supplied through her work, I buy my own. And I've seen the increases, since Obamacare, to the tune of about $5,000 a year, just for me. And I am considering taking the option of the penalty to—because, my problem with the penalty is, though, if I opt out of the program, and buy a private plan—just a catastrophic plan because I'm a very healthy man—if I take that option, not only is my income penalized, but my wife's income as well, because she makes a considerable more amount of money than I do, but she has insurance. So I don't think that's fair.\nAnd I don't think—the rate increase is just astronomical, and I'm in the county that only has one option—BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee—and I've got about $540-a-month premium for the $7,000 out-of-pocket deductible before I see any help at all. And I've even got to pay a high premium for a plan that I don't need or don't want.\nThe President. Will you be able to continue, in the years to come if you have to keep going like this?\nMr. Brown. They're dropping out every day, the suppliers in other counties. There's 35 counties in Tennessee that has no option at all right now. I don't know what those folks do.\nThe President. You know what that means? That means somebody is going to make a lot of money. You know that. They're going to make a lot of money. [Laughter] Somebody is going to—well, a few. You're not going to make it. They're going to make it.\nMr. Brown. Yes, sir.\nThe President. There are people very happy about this situation.\nMr. Brown. Thank you for the opportunity to be here.\nThe President. Well, I appreciate. Thank you, Joel.\nDoctor?\nHouston, TX, physician Dr. Robin Armstrong. Yes, sir. Well, I'm a physician in Texas, and thank you for allowing me to be here today. And I'll tell you, what I've seen is that a lot of patients really are not adequately covered by Obamacare. It was supposed to cover people, but—like everyone has said here—with the rising premiums and the rising deductibles. I take care of patients in the hospital, and the patients are shocked to get a $20,000 bill, and to find that they're responsible for $6,000 of that because their deductible is so high. And that's just a situation that cannot continue. Medicaid expansion under Obamacare really doesn't cover folks either, because many physicians are not even taking Medicare. They're not accepting it any longer in the outpatient setting. And so folks who have chronic medical illnesses, like cancer—my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and most of her treatment was actually as an outpatient, and it was very expensive outpatient care. Most physicians don't even accept Medicaid, so those patients are still uncovered.\nThe President. Right, and so——\nDr. Armstrong. And so the Medicaid expansion really hasn't covered them. The folks who have Obamacare insurance really are inadequately covered as well because they're still have—paying extremely high premiums and then having to pay extremely high deductibles. And so it's really——\nThe President. And do they even reach it with the high deductibles? They don't even reach it for the most part.\nDr. Armstrong. You know, oftentimes, they do not, unless they have some sort of serious medical problem——\nThe President. Right.\nDr. Armstrong. ——and they're in the hospital, and it's very expensive—they don't even reach their deductible oftentimes. And so it's unfortunate. And so I really appreciate it.\nI actually read the bill that's been produced that's coming out of the House now, and I really like a lot of the changes in it. I think that this is going to correct a lot of the issues that Obamacare has had. So I really appreciate what you all are doing. Thank you very much.\nThe President. Well, I appreciate it, doctor. Thank you. Say hello to your wife.\nDr. Armstrong. Yes, sir. I will. Thank you.\nThe President. Very nice. Thank you.\nGina.\nHammond, WI, resident Gina Sell. Hi, Mr. President, I'm Gina. I'm from Wisconsin. I'm a nurse, I'm a mom, and I am part of that huge group of middle class families that were impacted by the ACA.\nBefore ACA, we had insurance that was eventually cancelled, and I had written a letter to our Senator just asking him, what do I do? Do I quit my job completely so that we can obtain a subsidy—a job that I love, as a nurse in a hospital that I love? Or do I uproot my family and try to find a job with benefits that doesn't even cover the medical——\nThe President. So the health care is—the Obamacare forced you to actually—in a sense, forces you, economically and almost potentially, to get another job.\nMs. Sell. Right.\nThe President. Even though you like your job. That's nice.\nMs. Sell. Right. So I did end up getting a higher—a full-time position at the hospital that I worked at. But that came with a price, because I was working 3 days a week, and spending time with my small children, who are my number-one priority.\nThe President. Right. Ms. Sell. And after the ACA, I was forced—because we could not afford a premium of $1,200 per month and deductible that didn't cover anything—to find a job with benefits.\nThe President. Meaning the deductible was so high that, essentially, unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn't even be able to use it.\nMs. Sell. Correct, yes. And we're still in that boat. I mean, right now our deductible is $6,500. And so if I have a child who's extremely sick, it's going to cost me hundreds of dollars.\nThe President. Yes.\nMs. Sell. Just last week, my daughter had a fever, and I sent her to school for 3 days straight because I had to work to afford our insurance, and I couldn't afford to bring her to the doctor. So it has been devastating for our family.\nThe President. It's really not having insurance at all.\nMs. Sell. Right.\nThe President. A lot of Obamacare, you don't really have insurance, because the deductibles are so high that you really don't have insurance, if you think about it.\nAll right. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nMs. Sell. Thank you.\nThe President. Yes, sir.\nKnox Machinery President Gregory J. Knox. Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting us. This is great. I have to start with something. As I was leaving the house, my 11-year-old ran up to me and said, \"Dad, I'd like to give—have you give this to Mr. President for me.\" [Laughter]\nThe President. Let me have that. [Laughter]\nMr. Knox. Hold on. Before I—[inaudible]—I want to read the back.\nThe President. I wished I looked that good. [Laughter]\nMr. Knox. \"Dear President Trump, it is a great honor to be able to write to the President of the U.S.A. I think you are a great President and a great man. Also, don't worry, the picture of you on the front of this looks nothing like you.\" [Laughter]\nThe President. [Laughter] That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you. I wish I looked that good.\nMr. Knox. Sorry about the hair. All we had was orange.\nThe President. Well, thank your boy.\nMr. Knox. So I had the privilege of meeting with Secretary Price and Vice President Pence in Cincinnati about a week and a half ago at a roundtable, and I'll share with you what I shared with them. I started with a quote from the great President, Ronald Reagan, who said, \"The most terrifying words in the English language are, 'We're from the Government, and we're here to help.'\" [Laughter] Kind of my feeling on health care.\nFrankly, I think that the system was broken before the last administration got their hands on it. I started my company 21 years ago, and I had a vision of wanting to provide 100 percent full family health care for as long as I had a company, because I really felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do. I was one of the last holdouts. But sadly, after about 15 years, I really had a choice of either having a company or being able to provide my employees that level of health care. And that's sad. I tell my wife all the time—you can have anything you want; we just can't everything we want. We have the best health care system in the world—we do—but it needs to be fixed—whether it's small-business owners, like myself, and I'm a manufacturer; I'm on several boards in the Midwest in manufacturing.\nWhat we'd like to see is not a Government-operated market, but a free market.\nThe President. Sure.\nMr. Knox. I sell capital equipment for a living. We have a trade show every year, and there's hundreds and hundreds of people selling competitive products. If we had a health care show in my town, there would be three or four people under that roof. And as a businessman yourself, you know what that does to driving down costs or the lack thereof.\nThe President. Right, right.\nMr. Knox. So we would like to see more of a free market solution, going back to what made this country great—entrepreneurialism instead of empowerments; work ethics instead of welfare. And that's what we'd like to ask you for. And I'd like to say thank you very much.\nThe President. Well, as you know, that's what we're doing largely, but we also have to take care of people that can't afford to be——\nMr. Knox. Absolutely.\nThe President. ——in a position like you are. So we're going to do that. Largely, I think beyond everything, if you look at what's going to happen—the competitive bidding—every element of what we're doing is competitive bidding, but we have to take care of people who need the help.\nMr. Knox. Right.\nThe President. And there are a lot of people like that.\nMr. Knox. There's always been a safety net in the United States——\nThe President. There's got to be. Got to be.\nMr. Knox. ——and there should be. And unfortunately, when I see 50,000—or 50 million Americans taking assistance and—you know, they're marketing food stamps.\nThe President. Right, right.\nMr. Knox. It's, like, for the people who really can't provide for themselves, you know, we're all charitable people, we're Americans, we're the most generous nation on the face of the Earth. So I totally believe in safety nets for those who need them, but not free handouts for those who just don't want to work to—[inaudible].\nThe President. We're going to help a lot of people, but we are going to be very much free market. If they can afford, they will go out, and they'll be off the cost.\nGo ahead, Stan.\nBox Elder County, UT, Commission Chair Stan Summers. I'm Commissioner Stan Summers from Box Elder County, northern Utah. I think I'm probably the only other elected official here besides you guys. [Laughter] It's been an interesting ride to watch the health care system in the last 26 years. When my son was born, he was 3½ months premature, 26 years ago. And we had really good insurance. We basically didn't have to pay anything out of pocket besides what we were doing from where I worked. As time went on, you could kind of tell the health care system has been a little bit broke, and then all of a sudden the ACA—and I'm not going to call it the other word—I call it the last President's health care program. I don't want to even say that name.\nSo anyway——\nThe President. Other than that, you like him a lot, right? [Laughter]\nMr. Summers. Yes, exactly. [Laughter] It's got to the point where I own a couple of businesses too and do the things that I have to do. I actually ran for government so I could have insurance—and won. But now I'm looking at these people, saying, how can I provide insurance for them without raising taxes and doing these things that are happening.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Summers. Because everything has gone up. Utah didn't expand Medicaid; we weren't a part of it—a part of that—and we can see why now, because of the things that are happening throughout the Nation with States and companies and——\nThe President. Absolutely.\nMr. Summers. ——everybody else is going bankrupt.\nSo it got to the point where I ended up—not only with my businesses—had to drive a school bus to keep my wife at home with my kid that was ill. So now I own three businesses, I drive a school bus, and I'm an elected official, to be able to continue to do the things that I need to do with health care. The last 3—well, the last 3 years——\nThe President. So it's gone through the roof.\nMr. Summers. Oh, I've got a $6,000 deductible—HSA—but I will meet that again in 3 months. So I'm at 40—I think my wife said morning, at 4,800 or 4,900 bucks already this year in March to be able to meet my out-of-pocket maximum. And so by the time April comes, I would have met that to be able to continue to do. And if there was one thing I probably could ask you about—and my boy has got a rare disease, and I appreciate you talking about the rare [disease; White House correction.] community in your speeches—is that if somebody has cancer or somebody has a rare disease or continues to have problems, why do we have to do a deductible every year?\nI mean, so I'm sitting there at Christmas going, okay, my deductible has been met for 6 or 8 months, and I'm going to turn around and have to do it again for the same disease——\nThe President. Yes, that's a good question.\nMr. Summers. ——for the same symptoms, for the same everything.\nThe President. Tom, could you answer that? That would be interesting.\nSecretary Price. It's all about the risk and spreading the risk——\nMr. Summers. Right.\nSecretary Price. ——with insurance over a period of time. But it is a challenge for individuals with chronic disease, there's no doubt about it. Mr. Summers. And I appreciate you even thinking about it and talking about grassroots, and when you're talking about all the people that we support with the farmers and ranchers, and the small-businesspeople, and the people that are in manufacturing, our county is one of the largest manufacturing counties in the Nation per capita. And Nucor would love to tell you thanks.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Summers. Nucor Steel would love to tell you thanks for everything you've been doing.\nThe President. Nucor has been very good. It's going to get better too.\nMr. Summers. And we've got a ton of those. The space program—we used to make the shuttle——\nThe President. Right\nMr. Summers. ——rocket boosters out at ATK—Morton Thiokol. And we'd love to have the space program. I've got a really good friend.\nThe President. Those days are gone, but they're coming back.\nMr. Summers. I've got a friend that's going to go up in the next little bit, Lieutenant Commander Scott Maker Tingle, who is headed up on a spaceship from Russia. But he would love to come back to the United States and be able to go up through the United States. So all those jobs I know will come back with you.\nThe President. Well, Gary Cohn, who is sitting right next to you——\nMr. Summers. If there's anything we can do——\nThe President. ——he's a big believer in what you're saying, right, Gary?\nNational Economic Council Director Gary D. Cohn. Yes, sir.\nMr. Summers. If there's anything we can do to help you, the counties are behind you. We can find you low-hanging fruit to be able to pick off that tree to help with jobs. Just let us know where we can help.\nThe President. Good. Thank you, Stan.\nMr. Summers. Thank you for your time.\nThe President. Would you have anything to say, Tom, generally speaking?\nSecretary Price. Well, I—these stories, Mr. President, are really powerful, about the consequences of the current law, and you hear people's lives that have been affected in remarkably adverse ways that sometimes you don't think about as it relates to health care, whether it's businesses that haven't been able to survive or individuals who need to take three, four, five jobs; moms that can't be with their kids when they want. This is about real people. It's about real patients.\nAnd so working with you and your leadership, we are really excited about the opportunity to put in place a patient-centered system where patients and families and doctors are making decisions, and not Washington, DC.\nThe President. What about the concept that—and everybody knows it's happening—that Obamacare is imploding, that if we don't do anything, it's not even going to be around in another year? The insurance companies are fleeing. But now it seems to be getting this wonderful press like it's a wonderful thing, and it's a horrible thing actually and getting worse. And '17 will be, by far, the worst year so far.\nSecretary Price. Yes.\nThe President. Because a lot of things were put into '17. But '17 is going to be worse, and I assume '18 will be worse even than '17. So it's essentially gone. How do you respond to that? Because I've been telling you: \"Why don't we wait? Just let it implode, and let's not take the blame.\" I've been telling you that as an option.\nSecretary Price. Yes.\nThe President. It's not an option I like, frankly, but it's certainly an option. How do you respond to that?\nSecretary Price. I think '18 can be better if the—if we implement the law and we utilize the regulatory process to make some——\nThe President. Well, I'm not saying that. I'm saying, if we don't implement the law, what happens with Obamacare? What's going on with Obamacare?\nSecretary Price. What you'll see is a magnification of all these stories around this table: more businesses being harmed, more individuals not having the kind of income that they—disposable income that they would use, more moms and dads not able to care for their kids in the way that they believe to be most appropriate, more people getting insurance, but no care. This is about real people's lives, and that's why it's so important.\nThe President. Getting insurance, but not being able to use it because the deductibles are so high.\nSecretary Price. That's exactly right, exactly right.\nThe President. And you hear these stories where they're paying a fortune for insurance, and then you hear how high their deductible is. And unless they have a tragedy in their family, they're never going to be able to use it.\nSecretary Price. Yes, this fellow has to—$13,000 before the insurance kicks in. That's what he has to pay—$13,000.\nMr. Seife. That's like not having insurance.\nSecretary Price. That's like not having insurance.\nThe President. Well, keep working it.\nMs. Sertich. They're catastrophic plans now.\nSecretary Price. Exactly.\nThe President. He's been working very hard, and he's doing a great job.\nMr. Vice President, do you have anything to say?\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Well Mr. President, I think what—[inaudible]—these great Americans see in high relief is you're someone who puts people over politics. And I just want to thank all of them for coming and, in front of the national media, talking about the real world impacts of Obamacare. You've said it consistently over the last 2 years that Obamacare has failed. But these people are emblematic of the Americans that Obamacare has failed. And I just am so grateful for their time, but so grateful for your compassionate leadership in driving the Congress and driving our Nation toward better health care outcomes for them and better solutions built on those American principles of more consumer choices, more free market, but also, as you said, the caring for the most vulnerable by allowing our States to innovate and medicate in ways that will create even better health care coverage than they have today.\nThe President. Good, thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.\nHealth Care Reform\nQ. Mr. President, do you have any message for people who are concerned about losing their insurance, either through Medicaid or higher costs because they're older?\nThe President. It will get better. If we're allowed to do what we want to do, it will get better, much better. Hopefully, it will get very good.\nQ. So will it take long?\nThe President. Sure, takes a period of time, it does.", "timestamp": "2017-03-13", "title": "Remarks at a Listening Session on Health Care Reform and an Exchange With Reporters"}

He also referred to Executive Order 13781.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123527", "text": "Hello, everybody. I'm proud to welcome everyone to our first official Cabinet meeting.\n[At this point, the President greeted Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, who was seated to his left.]\nGeneral.\n[The President continued his remarks as follows.]\nI want to begin by updating the public on the severe weather situation. I've been receiving the latest information on the blizzard forecast, and I think we're in very good shape. We're prepared—everybody in government is fully prepared and ready. And the entire Northeast, it seems, is under a very severe winter storm warning. So let's hope it's not going to be as bad as some people are predicting. Usually it isn't.\nChancellor Merkel and I have just spoken, and she's going to be postponing the trip until Friday. She'll be coming on Friday, and we look forward to that. It will be a very good visit.\nI've spoken with my Homeland Security Adviser, who has spoken with the acting FEMA Administrator and instructed him to make certain that the Federal Government is ready to provide assistance to the States that need Federal help. FEMA and the Federal Government are ready to assist. They are literally waiting by the phones and ready to go.\nEveryone should listen to their State and local officials who will be providing regular storm updates. Take that advice very seriously.\nThis Cabinet is here to serve and protect the American people, and that's what we're doing—even more so than anybody would understand. The folks in this room have done an amazing job, whether it's security or anything else. I want to thank General Mattis, I want to thank—who is now Secretary Mattis. I want to thank General Kelly, who is now Secretary Kelly. They've done outstanding work. You see what's happening. All you have to do is just watch. Big difference.\nUnfortunately, not all of our Cabinet members could join us. We have four empty seats, which is a terrible thing because the Senate Democrats are continuing to obstruct the confirmation of our nominees for the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture, the Director of National Intelligence, and the United States Trade Representative, somebody I want very badly. We're in the midst of getting going, Wilbur, and they won't approve somebody who is highly qualified, and everybody understands that. The main victim of this very partisan obstruction is the American public.\nYet in spite of all of this, we've assembled a great team and already made historic progress in delivering results. We're rolling back job-crushing regulations at a faster clip than ever before by far. And we're seeing companies like Exxon, Walmart, Intel, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, and so many others announcing that they will keep and create tens of thousands of jobs in the United States. Many, many companies are not moving now, which normally they would have been out of here a long time ago. They're not moving because they understand there are going to be consequences. If they move, that's fine, but there will be consequences. It's not going to be so easy. They're not going to fire our people and move, and think they're going to ship their jobs back here and we won't be doing anything about it. The first two job reports that have come out since my Inauguration, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs. Right after this meeting, we'll be signing a new Executive order to begin the process of reorganizing the executive branch to make it less wasteful and more productive. We're also working closely with the House and Senate Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nObamacare, all of a sudden, the last couple of weeks is getting a false rep that maybe it's okay. It's not okay; it's a disaster, and people understand that. It's failed, and it's imploding. And if we let it go for another year, it will totally implode. In fact, I've told the Republicans, why don't you just let it go for another year, that way everybody will really understand how bad it is. But it would be the wrong thing for us to do and for the American people.\nThe House plan will expand choice, lower cost, and ensure health care access for all. We're negotiating with everybody. It's a big, fat, beautiful negotiation, and hopefully we'll come up with something that's going to be really terrific.\nI want to thank Paul Ryan and everybody—Mitch, everybody, they're all working around the clock. And I think ultimately the big beneficiary will be the American people. We'll end up with a really great health care plan.\nWe're also going to send Congress a budget request that will include one of the largest increases to defense spending in our history. And General/Secretary Mattis is extremely upset about that. [Laughter] And it will be fully paid for, okay? Fully paid for. And I saved a lot of money on those jets, didn't I? [Laughter] Did I do a good job? More than $725 million on them. He's very happy with me. [Laughter]\nIn the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my Executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent. I want to congratulate General Kelly.\nAt the same time, I've issued a Presidential memorandum directing Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to undertake immediate steps to enhance our vetting process. So we're further enhancing our vetting process. We want people in our country who love our country and have the potential to love our country and our people. That's who we want. My administration will work every day to serve and protect our great citizens, and we will not rest until the job is done.\nSo this is our first Cabinet meeting. I hope this is going to be a historic Cabinet meeting—historic in the sense that we're going to do a fantastic job for the American people, for our country, and for the future of our country.\nSo thank you all very much.

Billions and billions of dollars are being wasted on activities that are not delivering results for hardworking American taxpayers, and not even coming close.\nThis order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to see where money is being wasted, how services can be improved, and whether programs are truly serving American citizens.\nThe Director of Office of Management and Budget will oversee the evaluation, working with experts inside and outside of the Federal Government, as well as seeking input from the American people themselves.\nBased on this input, we will develop a detailed plan to make the Federal Government work better—reorganizing, consolidating, and eliminating where necessary. In other words, making the Federal Government more efficient and very, very cost productive.\nSo we're going to do something, I think, very, very special—will never have been done to the extent that we're going to be able to do it.

On behalf of the President of the United States, it is my great privilege to administer the oath of office to Seema Verma, who will become the 15th Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. You can applaud that if you want. I can tell you'd like to. (Applause.)\nI'm very pleased today to be joined, despite the inclement weather, by her wonderful family, including her husband, Sanjay; her daughter, Maya; her son, Sean. And we're also pleased that her mother, Denash (ph), and her sister, Dia (ph) are here. Join me in welcoming Seema Verma's entire family. (Applause.)\nMy friends, we've come to a critical moment in the life of our nation -- seven years ago, this month, the failed law known as Obamacare was signed into law. And it's proved to be a disaster. Its damage to our economy and our people literally grows with every passing year. We've all seen the headlines -- rising premiums, plummeting choices. Obamacare is collapsing, and the American people know it. The fact is that Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go.\nPresident Trump has made clear he's promised to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all with a better health care system, one that will benefit the health and well-being of the American people for generations to come.\nAnd, my friends, we're already in the process of keeping that promise. At this very moment, our administration is pursuing a multistep strategy to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something that actually works.\nStep one, we're working with the Congress to pass the American Health Care Act, which begins the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare by ending its taxes and penalties, expanding the use of health savings accounts -- and just to name a few of the important reforms that are in it.\nAt the same time, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, is already taking steps to get government out of the way to lower prices and increase choices for Americans. And we're working with Congress to pass legislation later this year that will create a dynamic national health insurance marketplace that will make affordable, high-quality health insurance accessible for every American. Allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines is an idea whose time has come.\nAt each step of this process, one of President Trump's most important objectives, though, has been to give the freedom and flexibility to states across the country to design health care programs, especially Medicaid, to the unique needs of their most vulnerable citizens.\nAnd that's where Seema Verma comes in. President Trump has chosen, frankly, one of the leading experts in America on state-based health care solutions to lead this important agency. Seema's extraordinary record stretches back for over 20 years. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University with a master's degree in public health, she went to work in the great state of Indiana for the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County.\nShe also worked for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials before founding her own health care company in 2001. And that's where she has really made her mark across the country.\nIn my home state of Indiana, she helped design the much-heralded Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 in 2015. Today, Indiana's program is leading the nation with its emphasis on personal responsibility and effective care for people who need it most.\nAnd beyond Indiana, she's helped states like Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky, and Michigan seek to update their programs to better reflect the unique needs of those states.\nSeema, President Trump has now asked you to bring your expertise to Washington, D.C. As Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, we're confident that you'll help restore health care decision-making to the states, and in the process, help make the best health care system in the world even better. And frankly, as a fellow Hoosier, I couldn't be more proud. Given your strong record of leadership, experience, and compassion, I can say with full confidence, along with the President, that we know you will rise to the challenge to help make American health care great again.\nAnd so, on behalf of President Trump, it's my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.) (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it's my privilege to introduce the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Seema Verma. (Applause.)\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA: Thank you. First of all, I want to thank my family for being here tonight -- or today. Their flight was cancelled last night, and they drove through a snowstorm just to be here with me. So I'm very, very grateful. (Applause.)\nI am humbled and honored to be here today and to have the opportunity to serve as the CMS Administrator. I'm grateful and appreciative of President Trump not only for asking me to be the Administrator but for putting together an incredibly talented group of individuals that he's brought from the private sector into government service. People like Dr. Tom Price. And I am proud to be a part of this team.\nAnd thank you to my good friend, Vice President Pence, for believing in me and for all of your support these past years. Your leadership in Indiana is paving the way for all states, and the future of health care in America. So, thank you.\nAnd thanks to all of you that have been involved in my confirmation process. Many of you have gone above and beyond to help me navigate the process, and I am so grateful for your support.\nToday, our health care stands at a crossroads and we have no choice but to fix our health care system. Under President Trump's leadership and vision, we finally have an incredible opportunity to move our health care system into one that puts Americans in charge of their health care and will ensure that all Americans have access to quality health care that they can afford.\nI am honored to be a part of this critical effort. We have so much work to get done, and I can't wait to begin.\nThank you very much.

SPICER: Looks like the snow didn't keep anyone away. Good afternoon. I hope -- I'm glad to see everyone made it safely in.\nAs you may have seen last night, the President met with D.C. Mayor Bowser and Metro general manager Wiedefeld about the preparations for the storm. The President continues to closely monitor the impact of the storm throughout the Northeast. The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has been in touch with state and local officials in the path of the storm to provide them guidance and support. As the storm continues to track the East Coast, heavy to intense snow, sleet, and strong winds could result in significant travel impacts and possible coastal flooding.\nAgain, the President encourages everyone to listen to their state and local leaders and public safety officers, and follow their warnings and closure notices. They are working around the clock to ensure the safety of our citizens and their families.\nIn light of the storm, the schedule for today changed a bit. Obviously, German Chancellor Merkel's visit was moved to Friday. We'll continue to provide you updates on the schedule as we grow closer to Friday.\nToday, the President had lunch with the Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This afternoon, the President will swear in Seema Verma as the Administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The President looks forward to having the spectacularly qualified and experienced Administrator Verma finally onboard, especially as we continue to lay the groundwork for historic reform of our healthcare system.\nLater this afternoon, the President and Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, will have a call with the CEO of Anthem Healthcare, Mr. Joseph Swedish. He will then have a phone call with Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McCarthy to further discuss the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act and a series of much-needed regulatory reforms to accompany that.\nThe President was glad to see the National Federation of Independent Businesses announce their support for the American Health Care Act, and FIB has previously identified healthcare along with small business taxes as their two biggest priorities, and the President's healthcare agenda will address many of their concerns for small businesses.\nYesterday, of course, the Congressional Budget Office released their report on the American Health Care Act. I know that there have been significant concerns about the CBO report, and I want to give a little bit of context to the numbers that have been going around.\nIn 2013, the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have coverage under Obamacare in 2016. They were way off. They were off by 13 million people -- over 50 percent. In fact, only 10.4 million people were actually covered. Reports now suggest that that number has dwindled down to 9 million. CBO coverage estimates are consistently wrong and, more importantly, did not take into consideration the comprehensive nature of the three-pronged plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act.\nWe're working to bring real relief and better choices to the American family. The two other prongs of our plan contain several additional reforms that will further drive down cost and increase coverage. When you get down to it, the Congressional Budget Office is there to measure the potential impact of programs on the federal budget. Its attempts to estimate coverage have been historically faulty. But in the portion of its analysis that focuses on what the office is really about, the CBO concedes that the American Health Care Act would actually reduce the deficit by over $330 billion and bring health insurance premiums down 10 percent, even before many of the significant reforms in prongs two and three have taken effect.\nAnd as I've mentioned before, some of these include expanding healthcare savings accounts, streamlining the process at FDA so that innovative and lower-cost medicines can get to patients faster, allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, which increases competition and decreases cost, permitting small businesses to band together to negotiate healthcare rates for all of their employees, and reforming the medical malpractice system so that doctors aren't spending their time and patients' money on unnecessary procedures.\nBeyond the numbers, let's talk about some real-life examples of the cost of Obamacare for some actual Americans who the President heard from during his listening session yesterday. Kim Sertich, a small-business owner in Arizona, had her healthcare cost skyrocket from $389.79 a month to $809.15. Carrie Couey from Colorado, a mother of six whose youngest son is autistic, saw her family's yearly insurance go from $1,700* [$17,000] to $52,000 for a lower-quality plan. And Joel Brown, a farmer from Tennessee, saw his catastrophic coverage cost spike in the wake of Obamacare from $119 a month to more than $500 per month.\nThese are the stories that really matter to millions of Americans who are suffering under Obamacare, and these are the stories that are at the top of the President's mind as he works towards reforming our healthcare system. The President is committed to working together with Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Majority Leader McConnell to create a system that's affordable and accessible to all Americans.\nLet me walk through the rest of the schedule for the week. Tomorrow, the President is headed to Michigan to meet with auto executives and workers, and will discuss how his plans for rolling back federal red tape will lead to more American jobs and higher wages, specifically in the automobile sector. It's a great opportunity for the President to showcase moves he's already made towards these ambitious \"Buy American, Hire American\" agenda, like encouraging investment and workforce training and developments so that Americans are ready for the jobs of the future, and removing the roadblocks that prevent American businesses from staying and expanding here in the United States.\nThe President hopes to build on the great optimism that he's built within the business community in anticipation of the renewed opportunities the President's economic agenda has already created. He and his team are hard at work to produce the results that the American people deserve and voted for last year.\nHe will also travel to Nashville, Tennessee, where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew Jackson's tomb on his 250th birthday.\nThursday, the Taoiseach of Ireland Kenny will come to the White House for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit, including a reception in honor of the Taoiseach and Mrs. Kenny. And as I mentioned, German Chancellor Merkel's visit will resume on Friday, and we will have an update on that schedule.\nWith that, I'm glad to take a few questions.\nQ: Sean, President Trump has said that under his plan there will be insurance for everybody. How do you square that with the CBO numbers? And is that a promise he can really keep?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's two issues that are important to note on that, Katherine. Number one, more and more Americans have no choices, so they don't have insurance. I've mentioned this before. Having a card and having coverage that when you walk into a doctor's office has a deductible of $15,000, $20,000 a year isn't coverage. That's a card. That doesn't get you the care you need. That doesn't allow you to get the procedure or the referral that you need from a doctor that's telling you what you need to have happen.\nThat's vastly different than what we hope to exist, which is giving people who don't have it -- and let's kind of -- I think it's important to add some context to this. If you think about the individual market that exists right now, the individual insurance market, you've got roughly 30 million people that exist right now -- 9 million people now are on the exchange. That number has gone down; 6.5 million people have said they don't want any insurance and they're going to pay a penalty, and then just under 14 million people have said that they have applied for a hardship. So you've got almost 20 million people in America who have said that they don't want Obamacare and they'll either pay a penalty or will apply for a hardship.\nThose are people who don't have it to begin with. The exchanges sought out to cover these people, and we're finding out that you've got 9 million-plus who are getting it right now. They have no coverage. And for more and more Americans, they're losing their coverage, their choices are gone. Tax credits in competition that will come in phases two and three in the prongs that we talked about will further drop prices down, will further increase competition.\nThe CBO score didn't take into consideration in that. And again, if you look at their numbers, you've got roughly just over 9 million people on the exchanges. The CBO number says that 14 million people in the first year alone will lose coverage. It doesn't take a ton of analysis to recognize that that doesn't make any sense logically. You can't only have 9-plus million people on the exchange and say in the first year alone, when there's no touch to Medicaid or anything else, you're just removing the individual mandate that forced people to buy something that they didn't want in the first place, that is going to lead to 14 million people -- that people are going to drop off Medicare, they're not going to take their employer -- that just doesn't add up.\nIn fact, I would argue that if you look at the other part of the equation, the 20 million-plus people who have either chosen to pay a penalty -- you think about that -- the 6.5 million people are saying either the plan is too costly, the plan doesn't provide coverage. I think a lot of those people, especially when we continue to instill additional coverage, they have more choices, they can pick a plan that actually fits their needs or fits their budget, you're going to see more people want coverage who are going to choose coverage.\nSo I think that the CBO number, A, they have a record that doesn't match up with the ability to count people. They're pretty good at dollars, not as good at people. And I think that when you look at the additional phases or prongs of this whole comprehensive approach, that actually changes the equation a lot. It's looking at one piece of a three-part plan, and that's not the entirety of the plan that we're looking at. So that doesn't --\nQ: So what does the White House think the change will be next year?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I don't think that we -- we don't do those projections. But I think that there's no question, when you look at the cost, they're already saying just this alone, just doing the first prong of this will take costs down 10 percent in the individual market. If you think about it, they're up 25 percent in the individual market on average already. This year alone, on just people who are on the exchanges, up 25 percent. The CBO is saying, just with what we're doing on the first prong alone, 10 percent decline in the individual market. That's a significant reduction.\nThat's what we're talking about. Bringing costs down, it increases choices. That's a big deal right now. The problem that you have currently is that these subsidies that people get get them a card that doesn't get them care. And that's what we need to start focusing on, is how many people are actually getting the care they need to deal with the medical concerns of them or their family. And that's not what's happening.\nMike.\nQ: Sean, stating as you did that the primary objection of this White House is that the CBO report doesn't take into account phase two and phase three, are there specifics either in terms of the specific regulatory reforms that the White House is considering and the specific terms of the legislation that you would offer that are out there for people to study as part of this? Because as you surely know, Tom Cotton among others are skeptical of whether these phases can actually --\nMR. SPICER: Look, the things that I mentioned earlier -- allowing people to buy across state lines, to pool their insurance, to expand HSAs, to reform the FDA -- all of those things I think unquestionably add competition and choice. There's no question about it. If one plan can sell that was in Maryland, into Virginia, where they can seek additional customers, that competition alone invariably brings down costs. And we've seen this in market after market where once you allow competition, by itself, that will bring down costs. It will bring in choice.\nRight now these insurance who have been mandated by the government to create certain packages that people don't need, you've got young people that are being told to buy packages that have end-of-life care that they don't necessarily need. You've got people who are in their older phases having to buy stuff for maternity that may not be a service that they need at their stage of life. But the problem is that the government got involved in health care and started dictating what needed to happen instead of allowing the choice and allow people to buy a plan that actually was tailored to the needs that they want.\nThose reforms in themselves unquestionably bring down cost. There's no question. But I think one of the issues that has to go back to overriding this issue -- and the President has stated this on numerous occasions -- if we do nothing, if we just allow this to continue, it will collapse on its own. The cost of it is unsustainable. The premiums are going sky-high in state after state. And the choices keep going further and further down.\nAnd so this idea of comparing it to Obamacare is a false choice because they have no choice. The choice is going away and the cost continues to get higher through every phase. And so to assume that the comparison is apples to apples is a false choice.\nQ: I'm not making that. But you've been critical from this podium of the Obama administration, of Democrats, in the way they went about passing the Affordable Care Act. In the interest of transparency that you accused them of not following, of shoving it down people's throat, shouldn't the White House, should HHS put those details out now? Should they put the legislative details out and the subsequent steps in phase three?\nMR. SPICER: I think the House is working on that in a lot of cases. And as that legislation gets done --\nQ: -- put the cards on the table now, because there's a lot of skepticism --\nMR. SPICER: I think that's a great question for Speaker Ryan, and I know that he's been working with a team in getting it done. And I think the sooner that we can get all those prongs out there, the better. I agree with you. But I think the big difference, just so we're clear, is that we posted this bill online, the Speaker had it out there, the President tweeted it out. Anyone in the country and anyone in the world, could read it. That's a vastly different approach than after it's being done, told, after we pass it you can read it, which is what Speaker Pelosi said.\nQ: Does the White House encourage Republicans to put details of the phase three legislation out there now?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, sure. The more that can get out there on those phases, absolutely. And I know the Speaker is working with his members to do that. But I think that's an appropriate question for the Speaker to answer, not for me. I know that we are trying to work with them. I know that there's a lot of members that are working with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and, frankly, on the other chamber as well. But I think that we continue -- and that's why I think we're talking about all of those prongs and all the pieces of them so that we can start making sure that people understand the comprehensive nature of this.\nQ: Will that happen before there's a vote on the --\nMR. SPICER: I think that's a question for Speaker Ryan to answer. I think the more we can get out there the better, though.\nAlexis.\nQ: Can I follow up on what Mike was asking about Senator Cotton? Why is the White House giving Senator Cotton full running room to go again and again in the media and to denigrate the House plan without bringing him in, discussing with him what Mike was just bringing up -- alternatives that he's suggesting? Why does he have special dispensation to go out?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think he has special dispensation. It's a free country; he can say what he wants.\nQ: But if you brought him in here --\nMR. SPICER: No, I think our team has been working with his team as they are with Senator Paul's team and anyone else who has ideas. We've been engaged in a very, very robust discussion with members in both chambers who have ideas to move this thing forward. I don't think we are able to tell people what they can and cannot engage in a free society. And Senator Cotton is obviously able to make any comments that he'd like. We'd obviously continue to like to work with him. And I think the team will continue to reach out to both he and his team to try to get his ideas on this.\nQ: But the President spent time talking to him about his ideas on immigration. Has he called him? Has the Vice President called Senator Cotton?\nMR. SPICER: I know that we've had a very, very robust discussion with members of the House and Senate. I would have to get specific details of what we've done with specifically Senator Cotton.\nQ: Is Senator Cruz coming today?\nMR. SPICER: I believe he -- I'd have to check on that. I know that there was a group of individuals. I don't have that list in front of me.\nQ: Senators?\nMR. SPICER: I will get back to you on that, Alexis, I promise. The snowstorm kind of shifted a bunch of stuff up, so I don't want to start getting in front of who actually can be here and who can't. But I will make sure that we get those details out and we have --\nQ: Can you get it to the pool?\nMR. SPICER: I'd be glad to get it to the entire pool.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: Margaret.\nQ: Thank you. So still on the same subject. Does the White House support the House bill as it is, or amending it? And there's been reporting that the White House is involved, or some White House officials are involved in shaping what's being described as like a major or significant manager's amendment in conjunction with conservatives. Can you tell --\nMR. SPICER: I would -- I'm sorry, please finish.\nQ: No, we can go back and forth. But I'm just wondering, can you -- is the White House writing this amendment or just considering backing the amendment? And does Paul Ryan know about it? We can tell him about it right now, I guess.\nMR. SPICER: I think Speaker Ryan is well aware of the manager's amendment. I think as we've noted multiple times from the podium, when people have ideas that are constructive or supportive, or ones that we have heard about from different members that we have engaged with, and, frankly, ones that the House and Senate has engaged with who shared ideas, we've always stated a willingness. Director Mulvaney has talked about it, Secretary Price, the President himself, the Vice President.\nPart of the reason we're engaging with these individuals is to hear their ideas, to talk to them about not just the content but the approach -- what can go in, what can go out, how we deal with the different phases, as Mike was asking, and when we go.\nBut all of that is part of a comprehensive strategy to engage with members who support us, who have ideas and want to be onboard, who want to be constructive in the process and achieve the President's goal of having a patient-centric healthcare system.\nSo we are obviously in talks with House leadership about the contents. But as I mentioned, the President will be on the phone with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy later this afternoon to talk to them about some of these ideas and some of the path forward. But that's part of the legislative process.\nQ: So all this -- actually, I have a second question. But just to clarify this, so this involves -- the White House is working to help shape that manager's amendment?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Okay. And on the visit of the Deputy Saudi Crown Prince today, can you talk us through a little bit more detail? Does that involve the resumption of arms sales? Is that about oil?\nMR. SPICER: It literally was wrapping up as we were walking over here, so I want to make sure that I get a readout. We'll provide that to the pool, as we do with all the leader visits. So I will have more details from that once -- they were concluding that visit as we were coming here, and so I'll make sure I get it.\nBlake.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. In the middle of all this, there is also the debt ceiling.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: How urgent of a priority is this? And how concerned is the administration in tackling this, given the letter that Secretary Mnuchin sent out last week?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, so Secretary Mnuchin sent a letter noting that, under the Budget Reconciliation Act, the Congress's debt authority had until March 15th. He notified them of that. We continue to work with Congress. As you know, we'll be releasing a budget later this week. That's part and parcel of our approach to fiscal responsibility, to making sure that we talk about the path forward, how we address both the ending of fiscal year '17 -- it goes until September 30th this year -- and then the budget, which would be fiscal year '18. But how we address our budget deficits, our debt, and our spending going forward is something that is a holistic conversation that the Secretary and Director Mulvaney and others, and the President and the Vice President are engaging with Congress on.\nSo this isn't -- our job under the law was to notify them of the authority that they passed when it expired, and I think the Secretary will work with Congress on a path forward as far as our debt situation.\nQ: Secondly, let me get your reaction to Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of Obamacare. He called essentially the plan that you've put forward, if it's implemented, a \"scam.\" Your reaction to that would be what?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the plan that he helped create hasn't done so well for Americans seeking health insurance. Again, I have to go to the numbers. But just think about what he sought out to do. There was a pool of people that needed healthcare; they got about 9 million of them. You got 14.4-plus-or-minus million of people who claimed a hardship exemption -- so they have no insurance; that are not receiving Medicaid; that don't qualify for any other assistance, who can't afford Obamacare. And then you've got another 6 million-plus that have chosen to pay the penalty. So I would argue that just on what he sought to achieve in the plan that he helped craft didn't achieve too many great results. Of the people that did get it, their premiums have gone sky high, their choices have gone down, and singlehandedly had a tremendous effect through the rest of the healthcare system.\nSo people who weren't even affected by Obamacare initially have now paid higher premiums and get less choices. So even for 175 million people who get employer-based healthcare, they felt the impact of what he sought out to do through higher prices, few choices. So, respectfully, I think that he should just hang out more time at MIT and focus -- and allow good ideas to continue to come forward so that we can focus on achieving the President's goal of doing what he sought out in the first place.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President several times recently has said that he would like his healthcare plan to have healthcare for everybody.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: The CBO score yesterday seems to indicate that that's not the case. Will the White House commit that after these phases two and three, if they are implemented, if they're ever offered publicly, that there will be healthcare for everybody? And if you can define that phrase, please.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think everybody who wants -- look at what Obamacare did. Again, I just ran through the numbers. You've got 30-plus million people of an Obamacare-mandated -- under penalty of law that you had to have health insurance, 9 million of the 30-plus million -- 30 plus-or-minus people got it; 4 million -- 4.5 [million] said, no, we'll pay the penalty; and then another 14 or so million said that we'll claim a hardship. So that was a government-mandated system, and they chose not to do it.\nI think that in many of these cases, that if people were given the choice and the option to get a plan that sought their needs, was tailored to what they wanted, it wasn't forced down their throat, that didn't give them services they didn't want, and brought down costs -- I read you some of the stories of the individuals -- and we've seen tremendous growth from people who got a reasonably priced plan on the individual market -- $119, $150 bucks a month, which I think for people who aren't getting their services through Medicaid because of their financial situation, for many middle-class families, while that's still a struggle, it's an attainable goal in many cases.\nWhen you're talking about $350, $500 on the individual market, that's a huge chunk of someone's individual take-home pay. And I think that getting a process that we have down that levels the playing field, allows people who aren't getting it through an employer-based system to get a tax credit, that at the same time lowers cost and creates more competition and choices, is actually going to give more people the option to have healthcare and to give more Americans that ability. I mean, right now, they're choosing not to do it.\nQ: (Inaudible) you more people. That's still not everybody.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, but everybody has a choice to get it. And that's what I think we want to do, is give everyone who wants to get healthcare the financial ability to get it is what the President is trying to achieve through this. And I think this is the system that will get them there. Right now, they're being forced to get it by a government-run system and in huge margins choosing not to. I think that's the system. And, by the way, they're getting a system that's failing and that is collapsing on its own and is only going in the wrong direction with higher prices, higher premiums, higher deductibles, and lower choice.\nI mean, that's what you've got now: If you're American citizen on the Obamacare exchange, you're paying more, you have a higher deductible, and your choice is going down. And so that is an unsustainable, unacceptable outcome for Americans who need care.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On immigration, a group that tracks the number of sanctuary cities in the U.S. came out with a report today saying there's now nearly 500 sanctuary cities across the country, and that number has grown by about three dozen just this year. Does that concern the White House? And does it suggest that your warnings about withholding federal funds is not getting through to people?\nMR. SPICER: I think the last poll I saw on this issue, on sanctuary cities, was somewhere in the 80 percent that American people don't support sanctuary cities, they don't want their tax dollars used to finance people who are in this country illegally. I think if you're a mayor or a councilman or a state representative or a governor in a state, you need to answer to the people that elected you, whether or not you're going to support this. From a federal perspective, I think the President has been very clear that we're not going to use federal taxpayer dollars to support cities that support services to people who are here in this country illegally. But I think at the end of the day, this is a question for mayors and councilmembers at the local level who have to answer to the people that elected them with clearly a position that is not in keeping with what most Americans believe.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You mentioned the call with the CEO of Anthem Health. Can you tell me what this proposal of the President means for health insurance companies? Will their profits go up or down under the President's proposal?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't think that's been the focus of the President's proposal. It's not about them, it's about patients. But I think what it means for them is that they finally get to create more choice and more plans and allow people to choose a plan that fits them. Right now, they don't have that choice. And, frankly, in more and more markets, companies like Anthem, UnitedHealth, Signa are pulling out -- Aetna -- because they don't have the choice and because of the government mandate. I think what we want to do is allow competition and choice to exist so that they can offer more options for the American people.\nQ: But will those companies make more money under the President's plan or less?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that. That's not been the focus of what we're doing now. And at the end of the day, right now they're pulling out of market after market, leaving the American people with fewer and fewer choices. So right now it's not a question of -- from the last I checked, I think many of them were doing pretty well, but it's the American people and its patients that are losing under the current system. So I think that there's a way you can do a little of both.\nHunter.\nQ: Yes. We've seen the White House and Secretary Price push back on calling this healthcare bill \"Trumpcare.\" Does anything need to change for the President to be comfortable putting his name on the bill?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I don't think -- the Obama administration didn't label it Obamacare, they called it the ACA. I mean, this is the American Health Care Act. The President is proud of it. The President is proud of the fact that we're working with Congress. But this is a bill that is not his, it's a joint effort that we've worked with the House and the Senate on. He's proud of it. He's proud of the impact that it's going to have on American patients. So I don't think this is about labels and names, this is about getting a job done.\nJohn.\nQ: You keep pointing out that the CBO did not take into consideration phases two or three. Some people might say that the White House has been criticizing the CBO for not taking into account phases two and three in their scoring of the first phase of this. How are they supposed to take into account something that doesn't yet exist?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that that's a question for the House offer. There are constraints that are put on the CBO in terms of what they can't consider. But I think that the point that we want to make is that -- and it came up yesterday at the briefing -- if members are going to base their vote off a score, they need to understand the totality and comprehensive nature of the entire program. And so to base your score off of one piece of information is literally looking --\nQ: But --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, let me answer the question.\nQ: That's all they had.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But what I'm saying is, is that the question that keeps being asked is to see all the reports on this about how it's going to impact and not note -- I mean, I don't recall too many packages that read on the evening news last night, or too many of the stories noting that it was one piece of a comprehensive package, noting that it was prong one of three prongs.\nSo, respectfully, I think that when we've gone out here and tried to make sure that people understand the comprehensive nature of what's happening and why it has to happen -- it wasn't by choice that we had to do this. There are certain ways that it had to be conducted because of how it was constructed in the first place in terms of how it gets repealed and replaced. The reconciliation piece of this, which is inside-baseball Senate talk may not make sense to a lot of people, but it's the way that we have to go -- the process by which we have to achieve this because of the Senate rules, which is how it was constructed in the first place when Democrats enacted it in 2009.\nThat being said, when we talk about this -- again, you guys, when there's a report that comes out on the evening news, or on cable news, or in the paper, and it doesn't explain the comprehensive nature of this, and it just said, \"the CBO says this is the impact, full stop,\" it is incumbent upon to make sure that people who are trying to understand what we're doing understand that there are two more pieces to come of this.\nAnd like anything else, it's like building a puzzle. If you only put a third of it on the table and said, hey, look, this puzzle is incomplete, we hid the other two-thirds pieces, is not explaining to people how the whole thing comes together.\nI think that is a very, very important piece of explaining how this whole thing is going to matter and impact the American people.\nQ: The other thing I'm curious about, too, is can this thing -- the President called it a big, beautiful negotiation. People like Jim Jordan say it's a big, beautiful dud. Is there a way to hammer this thing into shape where you can satisfy conservatives?\nMR. SPICER: I hope so.\nQ: Or do you have to -- as has been suggested by a number of people -- rip it up and start all over again? Because Jim Jordan just this morning was saying that the fundamental aspects of what was promised the American people by House members when they ran for election back in the fall, and by the President when he ran for election, is not in this bill.\nMR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, I would suggest that it's gone through two House committees that consisted of over 50 Republican members -- when you look at both committees -- with unanimous support. So I get that we can't --\nQ: (Inaudible) not a Freedom Caucus member on either one of those?\nMR. SPICER: Okay. I don't know that that's actually true.\nQ: Well, that's what they said.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, but -- I'm going to use Major Garrett to fact-check you. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, that's just what they're saying. They're saying they didn't get a chance --\nMR. SPICER: Four Pinocchios -- John Roberts.\nQ: I did not say that. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: But my point is, I think that we've got tremendous support. The President, as I've stated, wants to work with them. There will be a manager's amendment. And I hope that ultimately -- yeah, I'd love to have every member support this on both sides of the aisle. I think the President's principles and goals are going to benefit every American. And obviously, the more support we get, the better.\nAnd as we continue to meet with members and talk to them and get their ideas, I think we're going to have a phenomenal outcome of this bill. There's a lot of ways we continue to gather input and ideas. And the more that we can get that will achieve that goal, great.\nAnd so I hope that he continues to provide us with constructive ideas, and we look forward to getting as many as possible.\nMajor.\nQ: Sure, let's continue that conversation, because the manager's amendment --\nMR. SPICER: Now it's John's chance to fact check. (Laughter.)\nQ: The manager's amendment is a tacit admission that the bill, as written, can't pass. You wouldn't --\nMR. SPICER: No, that's not entirely true --\nQ: You wouldn't put together a manager's amendment if you had the votes, correct?\nMR. SPICER: Well, no, I think it's an admission of what we stated at the beginning of this entire process, which is the President was going to engage with members to hear their ideas. He welcomed them. Director Mulvaney stated it multiple times, and Secretary Price, the Vice President. We're not -- this has never been a \"take it or leave it.\" And I've said it from this podium; the President has talked about it, as you mentioned just a second ago. This is an opportunity to hear from individuals and groups and insurance -- and victims of Obamacare, doctors --\nQ: So is the goal of the manager's amendment to win more Freedom Caucus support --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. It's not a question of just -- it's not about --\nQ: -- by dealing with Medicaid or the tax credits or some other alterations?\nMR. SPICER: It's not about one caucus or one member.\nQ: It's not?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think this is about bringing people together. And if we have great ideas that will achieve a better outcome for the American people, then we're going to listen to them and we're going to incorporate them. I don't think that this is -- we have been very clear from the get-go: If you can come with a good idea that will strengthen this bill, that will benefit American patients, we'll do it.\nAnd so the manager's amendment is --\nQ: Passing a bill is about getting votes, right? You can't have a strong bill that can't pass, right?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, you can -- absolutely. But you can jam through a bill and get it out, and get 218 and send it over to the Senate. But I think that we want to get the strongest bill through the House with as many ideas and opinions and facts that will help strengthen this as possible.\nSo I'd rather -- instead of getting a bill through with 218, 219 -- work on a process as the Speaker and the Majority Leader have done that brings in additional ideas. And if we can get the bill higher and higher, we will.\nQ: To Tom Cotton's point -- because you talked about it just a second ago, prongs two and three -- he went out of his way to describe that process, process two and three -- because at least the third part of that is going to require 60 votes because it's outside of reconciliation -- by definition \"as mythical, imaginary, and just spin.\" And he's telling House Republicans, don't buy into this third- or second-prong argument because a practical, legislative matter don't exist. Because you need 60 votes to get them. And so if you \"walk the plank\" -- his words, not mine -- on this first initiative, you're not going to get second and third phase of this process because it can't get through the Senate.\nMR. SPICER: So there's a couple things. First, this is the only vehicle that seeks to achieve what people on our side of the aisle have been talking about since 2010. This is it. If we don't get this through, the goal of repealing Obamacare and instituting a system that will be patient-centered is going to be unbelievably difficult. This is the vehicle to do that. And so we welcome Senator Cotton's ideas.\nBut the second prong of this is administrative in nature. It is something that was delegated to Kathleen Sebelius, who was then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to do. So prong two is actually fairly easy to do, because the same authority that was granted to Secretary Sebelius now is in the auspices of Dr. Price. And he has the ability to implement and work on that, and I think he noted it yesterday that his office has already been going through and doing that. So that phase is easy to do.\nThe third prong, which is all of these things that conservatives have been championing for a long time, and, frankly, many Democrats agree with us on, is this ability to bring down costs through selling over state lines and allowing small businesses to group together is something that we've been talking about for over a decade.\nQ: And you can get 60 votes?\nMR. SPICER: And I think that we can not just get 60 -- I think this is something that should bring people together. I think there is bipartisan, bicameral support for almost every one of these things because they benefit -- there is no one that doesn't benefit. Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines? It's something that you can do your car insurance -- so many -- there is no other product that I can think of -- I'm sure someone will fact-check me on this -- but for the most part, the American consumer, when you want a product, you can go online, you can go to a store. You have choice. You could go to a store across state lines. If you live in Virginia, you can drive to Maryland or the District and shop around. With our insurance, we don't have that ability. There's no question that increased competition drives down cost. It is just an economic certainty. And allowing greater choice will do the same. And so I think, respectfully, I would say to any senator that has that concern, there is no other entity that I can think of that greater choice and greater competition doesn't drive down cost significantly.\nAnd all we have to do is look no farther than Obamacare. I read off three of the individuals the President met with yesterday who were victims of Obamacare. In every one of those cases, the insurance premium went skyrocketing when what? When choice and competition went away.\nMost any person that was in the individual market eight or nine years ago will tell you that depending on the plan, you could get a plan for as low as 100 bucks and change. Now the cheapest plan you can get is easily in the $300 range. And so the question that you have to ask yourself is, what changed? Competition went down and choice went down. And I think allowing both of those to reenter the marketplace will achieve in itself that goal. And going through the additional pieces of the reform will also do the same thing.\nThere's so many ways that we can achieve greater choice and competition that unquestionably bring down the cost of health care that benefits every American, whether or not you're in the exchanges or you're on an employer-based plan.\nAnd again, we have to have this conversation in the context of what's going on now. Talk to somebody that's on Medicare or Medicaid. Ask them if the doctor and services that they used to be getting are available to them. I know so many times now when you walk into the doctor they have a sign that says, \"We no longer accept Medicaid.\" That used to be a given almost. And now, for older Americans, for Americans at the lower end of the income scale, it's becoming harder and harder to find a place that even takes your insurance.\nAnd I think that to find that an acceptable income -- the question has to be asked of people who oppose this, no matter what side of the aisle they're on, is, what is your alternative? Because the ideas that they propose we can incorporate, we can make this better and better. But to sit back and act as though there's a choice. Doing nothing is not a choice. And that's something the President had done.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. As you know, the DOJ now has an additional week to produce evidence that President Trump was wiretapped by the Obama administration. How confident is President Trump that any evidence will arise to support his claim?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's extremely confident. There's been -- I mean, I mentioned this before -- I'll let them do their job. I'll let the House and Senate and I'll let the DOJ report this. But as I commented in the past, I think there's significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election. I'll leave it to them to issue their report. But I think he feels very confident it that will ultimately come to this -- will vindicate him.\nQ: And a quick follow-up. When a decision is announced, whatever evidence or potentially no evidence is released, will he make a statement about the evidence or lack of evidence?\nMR. SPICER: I've been asked this I think at least three times, and I don't want to prejudge what's going to come. I'm sure you will do a fine job of asking me the question when there's a report to be asked and I will not be able to escape it. But I don't want to get ahead of what the President may or may not do.\nJim.\nQ: Evidence will be presented?\nMR. SPICER: I don't want to get ahead of -- as I mentioned, I'm not going to --\nQ: Because the House Intelligence Committee has given the administration until Monday --\nMR. SPICER: I understand -- no, it's given the DOJ, and the Department of Justice. Again, we covered this yesterday. But I'm not going to get ahead of what they may or may not submit.\nQ: It's possible there may be nothing.\nMR. SPICER: No, that's not -- I think there is -- at least from where we stand, we know that there's significant reporting on the subject that --\nQ: Something will be presented.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I feel very confident of that.\nQ: Okay. And a follow-up on coverage. You were saying that people -- if they can't get access to insurance, they don't have coverage. But if you remove the individual mandate, you are going to have people who are not going to buy coverage, they're not going to buy insurance. And so getting back to the Congressional Budget Office score, would you concede that there will be some coverage losses, perhaps in the millions? That there will be millions of people who will not have health insurance as a result of what you're doing?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again -- sure, except you have to look at the current situation. You are mandated by law to buy insurance right now under Obamacare; 13-plus million people have asked for a hardship exemption, and 6.5-plus million people have determined to pay the penalty. So, currently, if we look at the universe and say it's roughly 30 million people, only 9 million people engaged in the exchanges when required by law. The majority, almost two-thirds, if my back-of-the-envelope math is right -- about two-thirds have chosen to either apply for a hardship exemption or pay a penalty.\nQ: The mandate forces people to buy insurance, and if they don't have insurance then you have the free rider problem in the system --\nMR. SPICER: Right. But look at what's happening now --\nQ: -- which was a problem in the Obama administration. You have free riders and those folks --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, because the current --\nQ: -- in a car accident, they show up at the emergency room, and then the health care is much more expensive.\nMR. SPICER: But my point, Jim, is that the way the system was constructed under Obamacare, they created a system to force people to buy plans that they did not like. They were mandated by the government in terms of what was part of the plan, what it had to cover, the deductible, et cetera, et cetera, and yet, roughly two-thirds of the people either paid a penalty or asked for a hardship exemption. They didn't do it.\nAnd so the idea is, actually, if you could bring down cost and choices and allow people to find a plan that fit their budget, that was tailored to their needs, there is actually a higher likelihood that they will find something that they want at a price that they can afford -- as to right now, which is I get a plan that I'm forced to buy that has a deductible that I can't afford, but I've got a cute little plastic card that I can wave around.\nQ: But it will get you coverage.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that's not true.\nQ: If you show up at the emergency room, if you've been hit by a bus, you're not going to need to pay out of pocket to the hospital until you die. You're going to have some sort of catastrophic coverage that will make sure you have insurance. That is the point.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, that's a great advertisement for --\nQ: You're welcome.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. That's exactly what the President is trying to do. Because right now you've got -- of the attempt to get 30 million people covered, 14.4 or 14.5 million people applied for a hardship exemption. They're exactly the people that you're talking about. Another 6.5 million people have paid the penalty and don't have it. So we have roughly 20 million people in this country who were supposed to be paying -- required to buy health care that have chosen not to do it who fall in exactly the category that you're talking about. The question --\nQ: But that number is massive by the year 2026 -- more than 20 million Americans --\nMR. SPICER: But if they actually had choices and had a plan option that was down near a budget that they could afford, there is a higher likelihood that they would buy a plan that was, A, tailored to them, and B, actually that they could afford.\nSo to your question about catastrophic, right now that's in most cases not even an option. In a third of all the counties in the United States, they only have one choice. In five states, they have one choice. Can you imagine if they could actually buy a plan --\nQ: You're saying a talking point, but at least --\nMR. SPICER: It's not a talking point.\nQ: -- there's coverage in those states. There's an option of coverage.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, it means -- right, and in a lot of --\nQ: If you pull this away then you're going to have people in a lot of states who aren't going to have access to any coverage --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, totally false.\nQ: -- because they can't afford it with these tax credits that you're providing.\nMR. SPICER: No, no --\nQ: There's an argument to the other side --\nMR. SPICER: No, there's not. No, actually --\nQ: The subsidies are more generous --\nMR. SPICER: You've got 175 million Americans that get their insurance through their employer. And frankly, right now they're the ones who keep paying higher and higher premiums because a system that was only supposed to help people get access and require them -- get a government-mandated, government-run healthcare has actually gone amuck. And so right now --\nQ: You say government-run health care. Medicare is government run.\nMR. SPICER: Right, and what's happening --\nQ: You don't have senior citizens screaming that they want you to get rid of their Medicare.\nMR. SPICER: Yes, they are. I think you need to maybe get outside and talk to some of them, because more and more Medicaid recipients -- in fact, more and more Medicare recipients -- aren't actually able to get coverage. Again, it's one thing to have a card. It's another thing to walk into a doctor's office and them to tell you, we no longer accept Medicaid anymore. That's not care.\nQ: But the President is okay with there are going to be millions of people who aren't going to have coverage?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, the President's goal is to provide healthcare coverage to every American. And right now they're not getting that. And by giving them more choices at a lower cost, more Americans can either buy healthcare for their family or themselves, or, in a lot of cases, for their business, without paying the penalty, which is what a lot of them are doing, or forcing people into exchanges that have fewer and fewer choices.\nThe system now is not working. The costs are going up, the choices are going down, and deductibles are going up. That is not an option. And for every American -- and I mentioned this earlier -- to make this look like a choice, there isn't really a choice. The system that we have now is failing. The choice is whether we give them an opportunity to have real care and in a way that is tailored to them in their budget.\nJeff.\nQ: Sean, on a different subject. The Intelligence Committee yesterday, when responding to the Department of Justice's request for more time, basically issued a subpoena threat. Does the White House have a reaction to that? Do you think it will come that far?\nMR. SPICER: I hope not. And as I said, as has been noted, the Department asked for additional time, and that will be up to the Intelligence Committee to grant that time. But they're working on that.\nQ: And on a separate note, you mentioned the President's call with the CEO of Anthem today. Does he have a position on Anthem's effort to merge with Signa, which was challenged by the Justice Department under President Obama?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'm not aware of that. I don't know that that would -- that the President has ever expressed any personal view. I think that would come under the FTC, if I'm correct, and so I'd refer you to them.\nJohn.\nQ: Just one last follow-up on Margaret's question about Saudi. I know that that meeting was just finishing up when you came out here, but can you give us a sense of what was on the agenda before they sat down?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President had a call earlier with the King, a couple weeks back. I think they talked about safe havens in Syria, they talked about the threat of ISIS. I would expect all of those came up. But again, I think -- I will provide a readout to you all, to everyone in the pool, about what happened that will more clearly define that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Coming up in the rest of the year are four special elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, all of which are sure to draw national attention as venues for debate on the American Health Care Act. Does the President plan to be involved on behalf of the Republican candidates and perhaps appear on their behalf of the districts as this may well be a barometer of where people feel about the American Health Care Act?\nMR. SPICER: You're also going to have elections in Virginia and New Jersey, as far as I'm aware. And I think that as we get further into the schedule and get closer to elections, we'll obviously entertain requests from candidates at a variety of -- level to gauge the President's support. So he's been very supportive of candidates in the last cycle. I don't see him not being -- continued support of people that want to fight hard for the agenda. We're not at that point yet, so I can probably give you more at some point as we move closer to the elections. But in a lot of those cases it's going to be dependent on whether or not there's a request from the candidate or not.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You said earlier that the White House doesn't have projections on how many people will lose coverage. Is that a projection that hasn't been made yet? Are you saying that the White House is not going to come out with those numbers?\nMR. SPICER: That's not something that OMB does.\nQ: But if you're advocating for a plan that you say the President wants to cover everyone, how are you going to be able to assess whether you've been successful if you're not going to project that yourself and CBO's projections, you're saying, are invalid?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that if you look at what the goal is, which is to make healthcare available to every American -- as I said, I mean, you have a choice right now that's either we support a failing system that there is no choice and that the premiums are going up, or you provide them with a system that we're looking at, which does address the 30 million people -- it gives them a tax credit, it gives them great choice. And one of the issues that I have with a lot of the models that I see around is they're very static; they talk about this prong only. I think when you look at the subsidy and the cost of a current plan right now, without looking at prong two and three and how those will additionally drive down cost, that it's not a fair analysis of where the plan is going.\nBut there's no question that right now there is -- I detailed it to Jim -- I mean, we have a system that mandates that people buy health insurance under penalty of law, and it's not working. And so the question is, what can we do instead and what can we replace that with that gives people greater choice and lowers cost. I think in most cases, of course some people are always going to choose in a free society to not purchase something -- I mean, we live in a country of 320 million people -- at some point, you can't force a product or a good down people in a free society. But I think if you can give them a quality product that serves their needs, that they have the time, at a price that they can afford, there's a greater likelihood under every economic model that that suggests that that will work.\nSo I think it's, frankly, economics 101 and basic common sense that dictate that the more competition and the more choice that we institute in the system, the greater likelihood of more and more Americans getting healthcare is something that is easy.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. I want to ask you about the American Health Care Act, but I want to first see if you have an answer to a question that I asked you yesterday, and that was one that you did not know the full answer to, about whether there are repercussions for violations of that five-year lobbying ban.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, I do owe you an explanation on that. I will check with Counsel and get back to you.\nQ: Okay. And then on the American Health Care Act, you use language very similar to language that House Speaker Paul Ryan used about why Republicans should support this legislation. You talked about this binary choice -- it's either this particular legislation or it's Obamacare. You have Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, you have President Trump in the White House. Why do they have to vote on this particular bill? Why can't they negotiate for something that, for instance, the Freedom Caucus thinks may be a better piece of legislation?\nMR. SPICER: Well, to get back to a question that Major asked -- I mean, at the end of the day, whatever it is has to at least get 218 votes. You obviously want the greatest number of votes as possible, but you need to get 218, and in the case of the Senate under reconciliation, only 50 votes. But that's your floor. And I think that what you need to do is to get enough members coalescing around key principles to get you to that floor. Now, you can obviously go as high as 435 in terms of the ceiling. I'm not sure we'll hit that. But the floor is what's going to coalesce the greatest number of members around a bill that gets you at 218.\nSo we will continue to work with them, provide ideas and input. And regardless of what caucus or faction you're a part of, if you have an idea that can enhance this bill and make it more patient-centric and achieve the goals, then we're all for it. So that's a process. And I think Speaker Ryan has been talking about this since 2010. There have been a lot of ideas, a lot of debate, and a lot of issues put forward into how to craft this.\nSo this has been something that's been in the works for seven-plus years in terms of getting members, at least in the Republican conference, to coalesce around principles and ideas and solutions to make this a more patient-centric thing.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Two quick clarifications and then one other thing. It sounded like you were telling Mike to ask Paul Ryan about phases two and three. Phase two would be regulatory measures that the President and Secretary Price would be in charge of. When can we expect to see a list of those from the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I will ask Secretary Price. I know that he mentioned yesterday when he came out to talk to folks after the score, that his office was working on that. I'll be glad to see if we have a timeline on that, and then follow up with you on that.\nQ: And also, it sounded like you were saying that the White House is confident that you'll get to 60 votes on those things in phase three, those measures that conservatives have been asking for. Is the White House confident about the 60 votes?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Okay. And then the final thing is, it's also on healthcare as well. Yesterday, Secretary Price said that he wasn't saying to disregard the CBO report completely. But that sounds like what the administration is arguing and what you're arguing as well from the podium. You said that the CBO coverage estimates are consistently wrong --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: -- and you've questioned their credibility from here.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, just to be clear, CBO is a budget office. They look at impacts on the federal budget. That is why they were created, and that's what they do. And I think to look at them in terms of their budget numbers is one thing; that's their job. And I think on the aspect of budget impact, it talked about how while we currently see a 25 percent increase in premiums this year under Obamacare and the individual market, it markedly shows that under the current American Health Care Act, there will be a 10 percent decline in premium.\nWhere I think the CBO has gotten it wrong -- and it's not a question of what we characterize it as; it's a fact -- the CBO, when it tried to project people and coverage, was over 50 percent wrong the last time. And the point that I think we're trying to make is that when you look at their record and you say the last time they did this they were off by more than 50 percent -- they projected 24 million who would be covered by Obamacare in the exchanges in 2016; in fact, that number was initially 10.4 and it's dropping.\nAnd so the question that you have to ask yourself is, if you're using that as a gauge to determine our vote, you need to question whether or not they do counting people like they do counting numbers. I think on the budget thing, that's what their wheelhouse is for, that's what they do -- they count budget -- they look at budgetary impact on things. When they have come to counting people, they've been wrong and vastly so. And I think it's important for people to understand that context in which those numbers are given to you. And I think that's something that I just want to make sure of.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I asked you yesterday about the President's response to Steve King. Do you have anything on that?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President believes that this is not a point of view that he shares. He believes he's the President for all Americans, and so I'll leave it at that.\nJim.\nQ: Reports surfaced Friday that the President will support primary challengers to conservative lawmakers who don't support the final version of the American Health Care Act. Can you confirm that report? And if it's true, can you offer us insight into what the President is looking for in congressional candidates in 2018?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I don't have anything for you on that.\nVeronica.\nQ: Sean, it's Ronica.\nMR. SPICER: Ronica.\nQ: I'm sorry.\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm sorry.\nQ: If we fix it now, we get it done. Okay, two questions. The first one: Does the President believe that he was surveilled through microwaves and televisions?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I will just say the President has tweeted about this. He's pretty clear that he believes that there was surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election, and we're going to wait for the conclusion of that. I think there's pretty sound evidence that has been -- that the microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone. And I think that has been cleaned up. It was made in jest. So I think we can put that to rest.\nQ: Okay. Second question. Newt Gingrich said that the COB [sic] should be abolished. You're saying some pretty harsh words against parts, aspects of the COB. Would the President agree with that?\nMR. SPICER: CBO.\nQ: Oh, excuse me.\nMR. SPICER: No, I got it wrong with you. So now we're even. (Laughter.)\nBut look, that's -- Speaker Gingrich obviously -- I'll let him comment on the House. CBO was established I think in the Budget Act from 1974. It's up to members to decide on the House and Senate whether or not they want to go through this. We've got OMB, they've got CBO. I'm not going to get in the business of telling the House who their scorekeeper should be in the House.\nCecilia.\nQ: Sean, just quickly, I wanted to circle back on something. You started to answer it, but apologies if you did. I want to clarify, though. Can you stand here today and say that the President will keep his promise of insurance for everybody?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's goal is to provide insurance -- to make insurance available to everybody, yes. That's what he intends to do. I think that is -- the goal of this is to make sure that every American has the choice and a plan that they can afford and that they have the choice to buy. And that's not what they have now.\nQ: Sean, thanks very much. I wonder if the White House has a view on reports from Bloomberg that Jared Kushner's family stands to gain around half a billion dollars from a real estate deal with Anbang Corporation, which is linked to the Chinese government, or has been linked to the Chinese government in the past.\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I mean, I'd leave that -- I'd refer you back to the Kushner companies to talk about their entities. Jared went through extraordinary lengths, as you all know, and we provided a lot of documentation on this, to make sure that he -- although he's not taking a salary here -- that he complied as if he was an employee, and went through extraordinary lengths to make sure that he de-conflicted himself and worked through the Office of Government Ethics.\nQ: Is Jared currently working on preparations for Xi Jinping's visit to Mar-a-Lago?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure he's involved in a lot of stuff. I don't know specifically who's involved in that visit.\nQ: Sean, you did just say that the President still stands by making sure that insurance can be afforded by everyone. What's your specific response to the CBO's estimate that for someone who's 64 years old, making $26,000, that right now, under current law, they would shell out $1,700 in a premium, but under this change, the premium would go up from $1,700 to $14,600? What's the message to a 54-year-old, who, 10 years from now, faces that?\nMR. SPICER: I think that, again, I would go back to the fact that I don't think that that analysis takes into consideration the choice that they have. Part of the problem right now, Steve, is a 54-year-old doesn't need certain things. They don't need maternity care, they don't need certain medical services that are being provided to them by this government product that is being forced on them right now.\nSo, number one, you have a product that is being served up to older Americans, middle-aged Americans, or younger Americans that doesn't fit where they are in life and the services that they need. And so, number one, having more choice and the ability to tailor a plan towards the needs that an individual has depending on their stage of life, whether it's an individual or a family, number one. Number two, that they don't have any competition. So when you combine both of those things together, I think that number goes way down. And then the third is that they can have whatever subsidy they want now, but on the exchange, in many cases, again, they're getting a subsidy to a plan that has a very high deductible so that they have a card but not care. And that is, again, not an apples-to-apples way to examine the current plans. And that's what this really all comes down to.\nQ: So the message then is, wait until phases two and three come in, and then we'll have something better?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think -- it's not just wait, it's that you have to look at the totality of what we're doing to understand how this is going to impact the plan. But right now, in the scenario that you're giving, a 54-year-old doesn't have choice, is buying a plan that they don't want or need for the most part, and has a subsidy that's probably not giving them the ability to go see the doctors that they need to because their deductible is off the chart. And that's one thing that's missing in a lot of these discussions, is that you can have a premium for month, but if your deductible is skyrocketing, then, again, you might be able to get an appointment, but you're not getting care.\nSharon.\nQ: Oh, Cheryl. Thanks.\nMR. SPICER: Cheryl. I'm not good on this side. (Laughter.)\nQ: The budget is coming out Thursday, and I'm just trying to find out how detailed is that going to be. Are you going to be giving agency levels, program levels? Or are we going to see what programs are going to be eliminated in the budget?\nMR. SPICER: I'll let Director Mulvaney -- he's going to have an entire presentation. I know they'll start background briefings tomorrow for you all. They'll walk through different aspects of the budget. I don't want to get ahead of him on this. So let's figure out where we go first on this with what he has, and then we'll have a full presentation on Thursday.\nQ: Can you just say if the infrastructure plan is going to be part of that, or is that going to be later?\nMR. SPICER: No, that's separate. That is separate.\nGabi.\nQ: Thanks. I have two questions. The first one: The President, one of his signature campaign promises on immigration was to pursue HB-1 visa reform. And on April 1st, the United States will begin accepting new HB-1 visa applications. Can we expect to see any movement on that before then?\nMR. SPICER: That's a good question. I don't -- I think -- we've talked about immigration in the past. I think there is an entire comprehensive process that's being looked at in terms of how we're preventing illegal immigration and then what we're doing about legal immigration, whether it's H1-Bs or K1 or other visas that exist within the system. There is an entire look that is being taken with respect to the visa program. And we will have more for you as we get through the system.\nThank you, guys, very much. We're headed off to Detroit and Nashville tomorrow. If you're not on the trip, we look forward to -- I hope everyone wears their green on Thursday and Friday. You got a double shot at it this year because of the visit. So thank you. Stay safe on the roads.\nQ: How are you all going to do the background briefings?\nMR. SPICER: Right here.\nEND 3:14 P.M.

Trump and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reaffirmed their support for a strong, broad, and enduring strategic partnership based on a shared interest and commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Middle East region. They directed their teams to explore additional steps across a broad range of political, military, security, economic, cultural, and social dimensions to further strengthen and elevate the United States-Saudi strategic relationship for the benefit of both countries. U.S. and Saudi officials intend to consult on additional steps to deepen commercial ties and promote investment, and to expand cooperation in the energy sector. The President and the Deputy Crown Prince noted the importance of confronting Iran's destabilizing regional activities while continuing to evaluate and strictly enforce the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The President expressed his strong desire to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to continue the two countries' consultations to help reach solutions for regional issues. More broadly, the President and Deputy Crown Prince noted the ongoing security and military cooperation between the two countries in confronting Daesh/ISIS and other transnational terrorist organizations that pose a threat to all nations.\nThe two countries announced their determination to strengthen their cooperation in the economic, commercial, investment, and energy fields, with the aim of realizing growth and prosperity in the two countries and the global economy. President Trump provided his support for developing a new United States-Saudi program, undertaken by joint U.S.-Saudi working groups, and its unique initiatives in energy, industry, infrastructure, and technology worth potentially more than $200 billion in direct and indirect investments within the next four years. The President also provided his support for United States investments in Saudi Arabia and the facilitation of bilateral trade, which will result in sizable opportunities for both countries. On energy, the two countries affirmed their desire to continue bilateral consultations in a way that enhances the growth of the global economy and limits supply disruption and market volatility.\nThe two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as one million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia. The Deputy Crown Prince reviewed Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 program for the President and agreed to put in place specific bilateral programs to help both countries benefit from new opportunities created by the Kingdom's implementation of those new economic plans.", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Press Release - Readout of the President's Meeting with Mohammed bin Salman Abdulaziz Al Saud, Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}

(Applause.)\nTonight is really a family affair. It's been said before from this podium this evening. I can tell you it feels that way to our family, and it's a joy for me tonight to be joined by my wife of 31 years and our new Second Lady, Karen Pence. (Applause.)\nKaren and I are also delighted to be joined tonight by our Irish daughter Charlotte Rose. (Applause.) And my Irish sisters, Annie and Mary, traveled from far across the country to be with us tonight. And if there weren't all these inches of snow, Mr. Taoiseach, I can assure my mother, 83 years young, red hair, crystal blue eyes, would still be here. But I know she's smiling. (Applause.)\nThis really does feel more like a homecoming for us, too, to be honest with you. And I'll talk about that on a personal level a little bit later.\nIt is my privilege to be here tonight on behalf of the President of the United States to address the American Ireland Fund. Since its founding in 1976, the fund and its sister organizations have raised a remarkable $550 million dollars to support peace, prosperity, and cultural accomplishment on the Emerald Isle. That's a staggering amount of generosity, as we've already heard before. Ireland, and all who call it home, have benefitted tremendously from the generosity of you who are gathered here tonight and all who have gone before.\nAnd that's worth dwelling on. There's a reason why so many in this room -- and in this country -- have been so generous towards Ireland. We may be separated by an ocean, but the American people have always been bound by a kinship to the Irish people, and we always will. (Applause.)\nThe bond between the people of America and the people of Ireland stretches back into the mists of American history. Drawn by the promise of this brave new world, the sons and daughters of Ireland began leaving their land for ours as far back as the 17th century. They came here, one by one, or sometimes in small bands. But what they lacked in numbers, we already heard tonight, they more than made up in courage.\nIrish immigrants and their descendants became proud patriots in America. Thousands fought for their adopted homeland -- and the timeless ideals we hold dear -- in our Revolutionary War. No fewer than nine, as you've already heard, signers of the Declaration of Independence, no fewer than four of the Founding Fathers at our Constitutional Convention could trace their roots to Ireland. And no less a man than George Washington himself, our first President, referred to Ireland as a \"friend of my country.\" And so it will always be. (Applause.)\nFrom the Revolutionary War to the Irish Brigades in our Civil War, Irish Americans have fought for freedom in every American conflict. And before I go one step further, would the men and women who are with us here tonight who have worn the uniform of the United States of America, please stand and give us the opportunity to thank you one more time for your service to this country? You make us proud. (Applause.)\nBut Ireland's contributions to America didn't end with the establishment of the shining city on a hill. Indeed, none saw that beacon more clearly, or with more excitement, than the Irish across the sea. Whereas once they had come to America slowly, in a trickle, suddenly the children of Ireland came here in a swell as history records.\nThey spread to every corner of this continent, settling in cities and towns, in places where none had settled before. And wherever they went, opportunity and prosperity soon followed. From the vantage point of the present, it's clear that the Irish have left an indelible mark on the history of this country for the betterment of the American people and the betterment of the world.\nOur history books are filled with the names of Irish immigrants and their descendants. More than 32 million Americans can trace their heritage back to Ireland, a reminder that the Irish are one of the strongest and most vibrant threads of our national fabric.\nAnd tonight, it's an honor to be here on behalf of President Trump to reaffirm the United States' enduring commitment to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, to the peace process, and above all else, to the timeless and enduring friendship between our people and yours. (Applause.)\nTonight, I'd like to express our friendship by letting you know that Americans of all backgrounds have been heartened to see Ireland's extraordinary accomplishments in recent years. The story of the Irish everywhere is one of facing hardship and emerging stronger for it, and there's perhaps no better recent example than Ireland's remarkable economic success story over the past decade.\nIt's amazing to think of Ireland's recovery after the global financial crisis. It was the first country to exit the IMF's Eurozone economic assistance program. And for the last two years, Ireland has been one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union. (Applause.)\nI firmly believe one of the key reasons for this is the drive, the determination, the character, and the ingenuity of the Irish people wherever they may live. Taoiseach, Ireland's success is testament I can say on behalf of everyone here to your strong leadership these past six years. And many leaders around the world would surely do well to emulate your example in Ireland. (Applause.)\nAnother sign of our friendship with Ireland is America's robust economic partnership with you. We host many innovative and successful Irish companies here in the United States, and in 2015 I'm pleased to see that Irish direct investment in America totaled $13.5 billion, creating many good-paying American jobs.\nTonight I'm proud to say with great confidence that our bond is strong, and it will grow stronger still. (Applause.)\nBut I'm not just here to discuss the Republic of Ireland. On behalf of President Trump, I'd also like to congratulate the people of Northern Ireland on their election only two weeks ago, which had one of the highest turnouts in recent memory.\nThe advance of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland is one of the great success stories of the past 20 years. Many in this room, and the Ireland Funds across the world, have played a leading role in fostering this progress. Senator Mitchell, you have been properly paid tribute tonight. Let me thank you personally. It's an honor to be with you tonight. I'm proud to be an American, the nation that you call home. And I'm proud of what Senator Mitchell and all of you have done to advance the peace and the prosperity of people all across the island. (Applause.)\nAnd we thank those unsung heroes in Ireland and Northern Ireland who day-in and day-out, do the difficult and important work of strengthening communities, educating children, building that brighter future for Emerald Isle and all who call it home. Their heroic actions bring to mind someone else, a proud son of Ireland, a proud servant of America -- Thomas Francis Meagher.\nOn this side of the Atlantic, we remember Meagher for his bravery in our Civil War. He led the Irish Brigade I mentioned just a few moments ago, and he ultimately rose to the rank of brigadier general. He was originally from Ireland. In 1848, he famously designed the Irish tricolor that flies over the republic to this very day.\nUpon presenting his design, he spoke words that resonate even today, and I quote: \"The white in the center signifies a lasting truce between the orange and the green -- and I trust that beneath its folds, the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood.\"\nTonight, let's all pray that those hands of brotherhood may never separate. (Applause.)\nLet's also pray to strengthen the hands of friendship that reach across the Atlantic, between the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the people of United States.\nThis bond was forged by our forebears, and it endures to this day, and it's bequeathed to us to strengthen it.\nWhether they left their homeland for another, or stayed in the country of their birth, they shared a heritage -- and more than that, they shared hope for a brighter future, and they strived to find it with all their might.\nSo many millions of them found it here on these shores. And we're proud that they call America home. The story of the Irish in America is the story of America itself. And as I close, let me just say it's hard for me to express the pride that I feel on night like tonight because my little family is a small part of that story, the story of Ireland and America.\nLike so many of my fellow countrymen, I literally carry Ireland with me everywhere I go. On one of my first trips to Ireland when I was a young man, I was sitting -- what did you call it? -- in a public house. (Laughter.) Pat Morrissey's Pub -- it's still open in Doonbeg to this day. Pat was around back then, and he let me help out behind the bar. I'll never forget the little old lady who spoke to me. And I told her very quickly that I was related to the Morrissey's, distant cousins. And I said, actually I'm Irish by heritage. And she looked at me and smile and said, you don't have to tell me, son, you've got a face like the map of Ireland. (Laughter.)\nIt does all go back to that day. It was Inauguration Day just a few short weeks ago. People ask me what I was thinking about surrounded by my wife and my children, our beautiful new daughter-in-law. My mother was just there, a few seats behind the President. I just kept thinking of that day in April in 1923. That was the day when Richard Michael Cawley stepped off the boat on Ellis Island. He was in his early 20s when he steamed into Upper New York Bay aboard the Andania, the ship that carried him here.\nI can't imagine what the sight of the Statue of Liberty meant to him that day, holding aloft the torch of freedom. My grandfather went home to be with the Lord when it was in about my 26th year. But we were very close. He said I was the only Irishman born among the four boys in our family. (Laughter.) Not sure yet what that meant. But I was flattered by it.\nMy grandpa had grown up in a little town called Tobercurry, in County Sligo. When I was young man I had a chance to visit that house before they tore it down. It was just a two-room house where his eight brothers and sisters grew up. And I literally walked up the hill that -- when Karen and I and the kids visited Ireland just a few years ago, we walked up that hill, as well. The legend in our family was my great grandmother had stood outside that little house and looked over at the Ox Mountains and looked off to the west, and told him that he needed to go because she said, there's a future there for you.\nHe wouldn't speak to his mother for 25 years. And when he said the old country, he said with a reverence that I could never adequately express. He talked about crossing the pond, talked about the heartbreak of that separation.\nBut as I stood on that inaugural stage, I just kept thinking of that Irishman. I kept thinking of what he would be thinking about looking down from glory. And I know two things for sure.\nNumber one, knowing me as well as he did, he would be extremely surprised. (Laughter.)\nNumber two, I have to think he just thought he was right. He was right about America. He was right to summon the courage as generations did before and since to come here and follow their dreams, and make the contributions that they did. He was right to drive that bus for 40 years in Chicago. He was right to raise that irascible redhead that would marry a fast-talking salesman and follow work down to a little, small farm town in southern Indiana and raise six kids with the same heritage and the same values that she had been raised with.\nThe truth is that whatever honors I will receive over the course of my service as Vice President, and to receive an honor in the name of the Irish people and my Irish heritage will count as chief among them. Because all that I am and all that I will ever be and all the service that I will ever render is owing to my Irish heritage. And I will summon what is the best of it as I serve the people of this country with the faith, with the determination, with the cheerfulness, the humility, and the humor that is characteristic of the great people of the Emerald Isle.\nSo here's to Ireland. Here's to the United States of America. Here's to our shared heritage, and here's to the confident, confident hope that the ties between our people and the Irish people will only grow and expand as the years go on to the betterment of our people and the world.\nThank you very much for this honor tonight. And God bless you all. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President to the American Ireland Fund National Gala"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123557", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Nashville, Tennessee\n4:27 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: All right, good afternoon. I wanted to mention here at the top that yesterday after the briefing, moments after she was sworn in -- Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price and Seema Verda, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in their first joint action, co-signed a letter to the nation's governors reaffirming the department's intent to work directly with the states to improve the Medicaid program and enhance the lives of the people it serves.\nThe Secretary and the Administrator echoed their strong belief -- of this entire administration -- that when states have more freedom to design programs that meet the diverse needs of the unique Medicaid population they'll produce reforms that result in better healthcare outcomes.\nTonight, White House officials will be flooding the zone on the repeal and replace option that we've talked about on healthcare. Dr. Price will be on CNN for a live town hall at 9:00 p.m., and the President will be appearing on Tucker Carlson on Fox, as well, describing his actions to repeal and replace Obamacare and replace it with a more patient-centric healthcare option.\nAlso last night, the President announced his intent to nominate several individuals to key administration posts -- James Donovan as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; J. Christopher Giancarlo as Chairman of the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission; Eric Hargan as the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services; Adam Lerrick as Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Finance; Andrew K. Maloney as Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury for Legislative Affairs; David Malpass, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs; Sigal Mandelker as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence; and Brent James McIntosh as General Counsel of the Department of Treasury.\nMoving on to today, this morning a broad coalition of leading conservative organizations sent an open letter to Congress endorsing the American Health Care Act. Some of the groups who signed the letter include the Americans for Tax Reform, the Association of Mature American Citizens, Log Cabin Republicans, and the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. These groups announced their support for the AHCA because they know it's a conservative and sensible step towards reforming our healthcare system.\nThe AHCA repeals nearly all of Obamacare's tax increases, implements the most significant entitle reform in over 20 years, and provides mean-tested tax credits for those who don't have access to employer-sponsored insurance or government programs.\nThis announcement comes on the same morning that the Department of Health and Human Services released enrollment numbers showing that almost half a million fewer Americans signed up for Obamacare this year than last.\nThe bottom line is Obamacare is on the brink of failure, and together with Congress, the President is working to deliver positive change to our broken healthcare system through both the AHCA and through additional policy changes that will increase competition and decrease costs.\nAlso today in Detroit the President made major announcements on CAFE greenhouse gas emissions standards for the auto sector. When leaders from around the U.S. auto industry met with the President during one of his first days in office, they discussed specific actions that he could take to eliminate government barriers to job creation and their industry. Specifically, they sent him a letter unanimously requesting the President \"reinstate the data-driven midterm review of fuel economy GHG rules through model year 2025 without prejudging the outcome and to harmonize federal requirements.\"\nThe President listened and researched the request. He concluded that this was the right thing today, and he quickly took action. Today in Michigan, the President celebrated the American manufacturing and ingenuity that this administration will continue to set free from unnecessary, overcomplicated, and unproductive regulation.\nOur nation's great auto manufacturers no longer have to wonder if they have an ally or an adversary in the White House. The President clearly showed once again today that he's committed to working together with businesses and unions to rethink our regulatory system to grow our economy.\nThe President's regulatory reform is being applauded across many industries, not just the auto industry that we saw here in Detroit. This morning the National Association of Home Builders released its monthly index for March, which is set at its all-time level in 12 years. The NAHB directly cited President Trump's \"actions on regulatory reform,\" specifically mentioning his recent executive orders on the Waters of the United States rule as a cause of the surge.\nUnder the President's leadership, the United States will once again be the world's greatest magnet for innovation and job creation.\nOnce we get to Nashville, the President will head to Andrew Jackson's Hermitage where he will take a tour and lay a wreath on the President's tomb in commemoration of his 250th birthday, which we celebrate today.\nOf course, tomorrow is budget day. OMB Director Mulvaney did a background briefing earlier this morning. There's a transcript available by the pool for those who weren't able to listen in.\nTomorrow, the President's budget blueprint will be delivered to the Hill and posted online, and tomorrow afternoon, Director Mulvaney will join us at the daily press briefing for all of your budget-related questions.\nFinally, I want to make sure that all of you remember to get your requests in for the Easter Egg Roll. The lottery went live today on Recreation.gov. It's available through Saturday of this week.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nQ: Scott, on the Yahoo-Russia -- oh, Sean. Who is Scott? I don't even --\nMR. SPICER: No, that's okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: On the Yahoo Russia hacking, was anyone from the administration read in before those indictments? And is the President planning any other actions against Russia after those indictments around this Yahoo hack?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not sure if anyone from the Department of Justice read anyone in, but I'm not aware of that. I would refer you to the Department of Justice on that.\nQ: Are there any other actions on Russia?\nMR. SPICER: I can't -- that's a Department of Justice issue.\nQ: On the tax returns that were published last night, a couple questions on that. Firstly, the statement last night said that the White House believes that MSNBC, I presume, is breaking the law. Are there intentions there -- I don't know if it would come from the President's personal lawyer or from the White House -- to pursue legal actions against MSNBC?\nMR. SPICER: I'd have to follow up with the President's personal lawyer. But, I mean, there's several issues there that are concerning with how they did it.\nNumber one, it is illegal to publish somebody's individual tax returns. That's against the law. And it's ironic, of all institutions, to have NBC News, in so many ways, brag about something like that. They are an institution -- and then not only did they violate it, but then they went on last night and through today, and questioned the President's integrity by whether or not he put them out.\nIt's ironic that a news institution like NBC News, that has sat in the briefing room day after day and questioned our integrity, and questioned whether or not we had the proof for certain issues and allegations and policies, and then sat there and speculated openly, and pushed a narrative about whether the President was behind this. It's despicable and reprehensible, and they should be ashamed of themselves as how they conducted themselves regarding this entire episode.\nQ: To be clear, the President did not himself personally send those tax returns?\nMR. SPICER: No, and I think it's offensive to ask that question. And I think that, frankly, how NBC News handled this, and the idea that they made a spectacle of it just shows how desperate they are for ratings.\nQ: And then to follow up on that. I mean, last night, as that report was about to come out, the White House released a statement that included two numbers: the amount that the President paid in taxes -- income taxes -- that year, and then his full income. I want to understand why, during the campaign, a move was never made to just release those numbers, and would the White House consider releasing those numbers for maybe the past 10 years?\nMR. SPICER: Number one, those numbers were obtained and released to us illegally. They were provided to us by them, to ask us for comment. But to sort of use one illegal act, and then say we should act further on that is somewhat preposterous. The President has asked and answered this issue over and over again throughout the campaign and multiple times since he's been President.\nSo the issue still stands. And I think to use the fruit to talk about, well, because they obtained one year illegally, we should respond in kind with several years is preposterous.\nQ: Sean, can I ask you, with these tax returns, do you know if these 2005 numbers were under audit?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I don't know.\nQ: Can I ask you, separate -- Republicans and Democrats in the House Intel Committee said today they still don't have any evidence of wiretapping. Will the President apologize to former President Obama for this? They still have no evidence of this.\nMR. SPICER: I think what Chairman Nunes said is twofold. One is that he said he did not have anything at this time. Two is that he said that can understand that the President has tweeted that there is a lot there with regarding surveillance during the cycle. And again, I think this is -- the Department of Justice asked for an additional week to provide information. We are still at the beginning stages of this. We asked both the House and Senate to look into this. We hope they will. We believe that they will have further updates as they go through this process.\nBut, again, these two individuals today were making comments on where we stand right now. And I think, as we go through the process, I think as I mentioned yesterday, the President feels very comfortable that there is information out there regarding surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election.\nQ: Sean, follow-up: Nunes said, \"I don't think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower.\" You've broadened it to surveillance. Does the White House still believe that there was a wiretap of Trump Tower?\nMR. SPICER: I answered this question two days ago in the briefing, and the President has discussed this. I think it's something that he was asked by Tucker Carlson, and he'll answer it tonight. But he was very clear that, you know, he used the wiretap, generally. He put it in quotes, to mean that it counts for surveillance and all types of activity of that sort.\nQ: Sean, can I ask you about the healthcare plan? Republicans on the Hill today were saying that they had gotten some sense that you guys had accepted changes to that plan. Are there --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think one of the things that I'll say is that the President has been very clear -- I've mentioned this from the briefing room several times; Director Mulvaney and Director Price have mentioned it as well -- that we want to work with the House to achieve the best outcome. And if members have ideas --I know that there's talk of a manager's amendment, and we're obviously in talks with Speaker Ryan and the entire leadership team over there, and is Director Mulvaney and Secretary Price to get the best outcome based on the feedback from members.\nBut that's why he continues to bring in groups of senators, groups of House members -- to have those discussions, to find out if we can achieve the best outcome.\nQ: But at this point, have you agreed to anything that would go in the manager's amendment?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'm not privy to -- this is not -- once we have a manager's amendment that we can talk about, we will. But there is an ongoing discussion about areas that we can get to. And again, one of the points that I talked about in the briefing yesterday is there's a lot of ideas out there, and I think, at the end of the day, we have to make sure that all of those ideas continue to the goal of growing the vote from 218 up.\nThere are some ideas that while have merit and may have a lot of support don't have enough merit -- have support to help grow the bill or have a majority support, and that's important when you're looking at trying to pass legislation through the House or the Senate.\nQ: Sounds like there are some things that you can rule out then? Can you tell us what's definitely not going to be in there?\nMR. SPICER: Again, this is something that was an ongoing process with the House at this time, and I'm sure we'll go through it with the Senate as well. And I don't want to sit here and prejudge where we are at this stage because it is ongoing.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, do you believe, does the White House believe there are enough votes in the Senate right now for HCA to pass?\nMR. SPICER: I think, obviously, the focus is -- I don't mean to sound evasive, but the first goal is to get it through the House, and then to worry about the Senate. I think until you have a product that comes out of the House with a manager's amendment that the Speaker is working on, there's not something necessarily that every senator can fully make a determination as to how their vote is.\nI think they've started to talk. There was a group over yesterday, as you're well aware -- Senator Cruz, Senator Sasse, Senator Strange, several others -- that provided their input to staff as far as things that they'd like to see. Staff is going to continue to work on that.\nRemember that as that bill leaves the House it will be an opportunity for senators to have their say as well. And so this is part of a legislative process.\nQ: On a separate subject, some members of Congress have asked for James Comey to say one way or another whether there's an investigation into the campaign and Russia ties. Does the White House, does the President believe that for the sake of clarity that James Comey should be more specific about whether an investigation exists?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to interfere with those discussions. I think that's up to -- I don't want to get in the middle of Congress and their request. So I'll leave that up to Director Comey and to Congress to determine what's appropriate.\nQ: Does the President want to know whether an investigation exists?\nQ: Does he know?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's an area -- it's not a question of one, Abby, it's a question of we've made it clear what we -- how we think this has to happen. I think what's important to note is that every single member that I'm aware of that has publicly come out that has been briefed has said that there is nothing, no connection between the campaign and Russia.\nAnd I think we have to be very clear that there are two issues. There's always been a discussion in the IC community network about Russian activity. Then there's the bigger issue that the media has been obsessed with, which is whether or not there was a connection between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Every single person that has been briefed on that secondary matter has said that they've seen nothing there, including Director Clapper, including others that have been briefed by Director Comey -- Senator Cotton, Senator Burr, Senator -- Chairman Nunes -- over and over again. And, again, it's interesting that when we talk about proof -- as far as the previous question on wiretapping -- I don't know how much more proof that we can get in terms of the number of people that have been briefed that have said that when it comes to involvement with Russia there's nothing that they -- that has been shown to anybody who was aware of the situation.\nAnd so I don't know how many times we have to answer this question before people who have been briefed come up with the same conclusion that there's nothing there.\nQ: Did the President meet with the Mayor of Flint today? Did that meeting take place?\nMR. SPICER: I believe he did speak with her briefly before they departed.\nQ: Do you know if he raised a question in the listening session about lead in paint and whether the paint are still as good given the lead regulations? Do you know at all where his thinking is coming from on that, any thoughts about --\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I don't.\nQ: -- of what the two of them discussed during their meeting?\nMR. SPICER: It wasn't a meeting -- I mean, it was on the way out, the President met with several individuals and he had an opportunity to talk to them about -- just thanking them, and it was a brief conversation.\nQ: -- the President request for the two of them to spend some time together?\nMR. SPICER: -- follow up from the last time that he had been in Flint, so I'm not exactly sure what the nature of how it came to be. I can ask a little bit from our staff how that came to be, but I know that they wanted a chance to say hi.\nQ: On the CAFE regulations, the President kind of sounded like he believed that fuel efficiency regulations shouldn't get in the way of auto companies creating more cars. Does he have an opinion on where those fuel efficiency regulations ought to be? Does he think that they are too high?\nMR. SPICER: Just to be clear, I think one of the things that's interesting -- and I know there was a briefing for you guys on this -- that what the Obama administration did is rush through a process that they had promised the automakers and, frankly, the unions as well as far as how this determination would be. Right now we've got three entities looking at efficiency and emission standards. I think what the President actually went back to is say that we are going to follow on the process that the Obama administration originally had promised those automakers and unions. That's simply it -- is agreeing to a process that had been agreed to early on.\nQ: He hasn't himself prejudged what he would like the outcome to be?\nMR. SPICER: No. He said it very clearly during his remarks that all he wanted to do was return to the promise that was made to these individuals.\nThank you guys very much. Return to your seats and hopefully you can stay safe.\nEND 4:43 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123558", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:27 A.M. EDT\nMR. CZWARTACKI: Good morning. This is Director Mulvaney's review of the 2018 budget blueprint. I want to reiterate again that this is on background -- this is embargoed. His remarks are on the record, but embargoed until 12:01 tomorrow, or in other words, tonight. 12:01 a.m. is -- until the embargo is holding. And with that, Director Mulvaney will come up. He will be on the record, and have a few words. Thank you.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks, John. And I apologize, I'm going to try and speak a little bit more loudly than I ordinarily do. They tell me there's folks on the phone who can't hear. So if you hear me projecting a little more than normal, that's for the benefit of the folks who aren't here.\nThanks for coming. I apologize for being a few minutes late. The simple message is fairly straightforward. You've heard from me before, so I'll make a very brief comment, and then we'll take your questions, which is: This is the \"America First\" budget. In fact, we wrote it using the President's own words. We went through his speeches, we went through articles that have been written about his policies, we talked to him, and we wanted to know what his policies were, and we turned those policies into numbers. So you have an \"America First\" candidate, you have an \"America First\" budget.\nKnowing what you know about the President, you could imagine what that budget would look like before you even see it, which is that there will be more money on defense -- $54 billion. We could talk about more of that in a second. There's more money for enforcing security at the border. There's more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. Then there's more money for things like private and public school choice.\nConversely, since the President wanted to do that without adding to the already-projected $488 billion deficit in fiscal year 2018, there were reductions elsewhere to offset dollar for dollar, all of those increases. So we say, plus-up the defense topline number by $54 billion. You will, in other parts of the budget, find a corresponding $54 billion's worth of reductions. So the President accomplishes his priorities without adding to the deficit. That's not to say the balance of the budget is balanced next year. It doesn't. We've simply not added to the deficit in order to accomplish these policies.\nAs a result, you'll see reductions exactly where you would expect it from a President who just ran on an \"America First\" campaign. You'll see reductions in the State Department. We'll talk more about that in a second. You'll see reductions in the EPA. In fact, you'll see reductions in many agencies as he tries to shrink the role of government, drive efficiencies, go after waste, duplicative programs, those types of things. If he said it on the campaign, it's in the budget.\nI'll talk about the defense line for a second. We've worked very closely with the Defense Department to make sure a couple of things -- that this funds their needs, but does so in a responsible fashion in terms of what they can actually spend this year. The Defense Department has told us this is the amount of money they need and can spend effectively this year. We're not throwing money after a problem and claiming that we have fixed it. The Defense Department has given us every assurance they can spend -- this full $54 billion -- next year in a responsible fashion. And I believe General Mattis when he tells me that.\nRegarding some of the reductions, you'll see a fairly dramatic reduction in State Department. That is not a commentary on the President's policies towards the State Department. That is a comment on the President's policies towards what's in their budget. The foreign aid line items in the budget, many of them, just happen to fall within the State Department functions. The President ran saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home. So when you go to implement that policy, you go to things like foreign aid, and those get reduced. If those had been in the Department of Education, you'd see a more dramatic decrease in education. If they had been in energy, you'd see the decrease there. It just so happens, under the way we spend money in this country, that the foreign aid line items fall within State Department. So I think the number you're going to see in the State Department is fairly significant. Off the top of my head, it's 28 percent reduction.\nAnyway, I can take some questions. We'll go through the specifics, and I think we're releasing the document when?\nAIDE: 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sorry?\nAIDE: 7:00 a.m.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: 7:00 A.M. tomorrow morning. Yes, sir.\nQ: You said that you went through the President's speeches and this reflects that. The President, also during the campaign, had railed against the national debt, which is approaching $20 trillion. I know you say you're not adding to projected deficits, but yet you are willing to take on deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars. And my basic question is why, if the President railed against the national debt that keeps on skyrocketing?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, and I'm sorry. Should I repeat the question for the benefit of the people who are gone, or should I -- okay, for the people who are not here, the question relates to debt. And if I was going to paraphrase, the President railed against the deficits, yet doesn't reduce them in this blueprint. Is that your question?\nQ: Yeah, I mean, the national debt keeps rising and --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's fine. So the national debt keeps going up. Why then haven't we done something about that in the blueprint? Is that an accurate restatement of your question, more or less? And I apologize if I butchered that.\nThe answer is pretty simple, which is that this is a budget blueprint, not a complete budget. So what you will not see here: You will not see revenue projections, you will not see larger policy statements, and, importantly, you will not see anything having to do with mandatory spending. And anybody who looks at the deficit and knows the issues of the deficit knows that you cannot balance the deficit in the discretionary budget. The balance budget is not balanced this year. We expect the budget deficit to be roughly the $488 billion for FY2018, as estimated by the CBO, and we're assuming that to be the case.\nThe President's commentary on deficits, though, that is contained in this budget blueprint is that he wanted to accomplish all of the things I just laid out regarding defense, immigration, law enforcement, VA benefits and education, without adding to the deficit. All right? In previous administrations, what they would do is they would lay out their priorities and all that money would be borrowed, and they would increase the deficit. Whatever the deficit happened to be that year would go up by that President's priorities. That's not the case here.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Can you walk us through the 28 percent reduction at the State Department?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, we can go through it tomorrow. I mentioned that number because I think there was some numbers that were leaked that were different than that, and I make that point to say that they weren't accurate. I will say this, John, which is that we believe that we have protected the core diplomatic function of State. And that's why I say this is not a reflection of the President's policies regarding an attitude towards State.\nThe President believes very strongly in what Mr. Tillerson is doing, and I think Mr. Tillerson has already had at least one dramatic success since he's been here in the agreements he reached with Iraq. What you see in the State Department budget is the reflection of the reductions in the foreign aid programs. You have a follow-up on that?\nQ: Yes, can you give us some other idea of percentage reductions across some of the other agencies?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, because I can't remember them off the top of my head. I know the Defense Department was up ten, I believe that Homeland was up six, and I cannot remember -- and a lot of them were in the ten to twelve range, but, again, I don't remember the list off the top of my head.\nYes, sir.\nQ: On the EPA, my understanding is that 25 percent cut roughly -- 24, 25 -- proposed $2 billion, about 3,000 jobs. Scott Pruitt did not quarrel with those figures at a macro level. There were a couple of disagreements on environmental cleanup that basically said, yes, we're happy with this. The (inaudible) internally. Now there are discussions about making even deeper cuts to the EPA. Could you talk a little bit about that?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: A couple things, yeah. We absolutely believe, again, as with State, that the core functions of the EPA can be satisfied -- in fact, beyond the core functions can be satisfied with this budget. We've worked very closely with Mr. Pruitt. He's done a tremendous job to try and prioritize things over at the EPA. And we worked with him on those priorities.\nRegarding job reductions, you mentioned 3,000 people. I will tell you the same thing that I told Mr. Pruitt and told the other agencies, which is, we will work with you -- which is a different process this year. Ordinarily, a President's budget will come and say, you were going to spend this amount of money and you were going to take the reductions over there. And that's not how that this President worked. We did set the topline numbers, worked with some of the agencies on adjusting some of those numbers as they saw fit. But we have given them a tremendous amount of flexibility within their own agencies this year. So I can't -- I wouldn't comment on the number of proposed job reductions, because ultimately it will fall to Mr. Pruitt to how to implement those topline numbers.\nQ: And that's the point I've been told. But what I want to understand is, how much more aggressive a topline level are you discussing in terms of -- right now it's at about that $2-billion-level. How much more aggressive?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't remember the line-item reduction of the EPA, and I don't have the document in front of me.\nLet me go in the back, and then I'll come back. And I understand people on the phone can't ask questions.\nQ: Can I just ask, what exactly are we going to see tomorrow? Are we going to see agency-level funding? Will there be any fiscal year '17 numbers? And will there be a supplemental for this?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: So three questions is one question.\nQ: Yes. (Laughter.)\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's okay.\nQ: What are we going to see tomorrow?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: All right. The question is, what are we going to see tomorrow, and then I'll go ahead and answer the '17 budget. And then what was your other one?\nQ: Supplemental.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Supplemental. Okay. Thank you very much. All right, what are you going to see tomorrow? You're going to see the actual budget blueprint, which will hit the highlights. It will show you the total funding for the agency, and there will be bullet points on each one as to where we might have plus-up spending, and also details on where we've lowered spending. You will not see a --\nQ: For each department and agency.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: You will not a see a spreadsheet that goes line by line to the budget. Again, that's up to the agencies to implement. FY17 will be rolled out at the same time, so we'll be talking about that. I met with Senate appropriators over the course of the last couple weeks. I met with several of the House appropriators yesterday. And we will be rolling out '17 Thursday, as well. What day of the week is it, folks?\nQ: Wednesday.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Is it Wednesday? So when I say Thursday, what I mean is tomorrow. (Laughter.) More importantly, the day before St. Patrick's Day, which is all that really counts.\nRegarding the supplemental -- yes, part of our '17 request will include a supplemental request -- $30 billion for defense and primarily border. That includes $1.5 billion for the wall this year. There will be money in the FY2018 money for a wall, as well, as you can possibly imagine. And the '17 proposals that we have sort of dovetail into the '18. So by the same token, there's also proposed reductions in '17. So if you took sort of '18 and compressed it into a little version of '17, which you'll see in '17 follows the same sort of general outline: more spending on defense, more spending on border enforcement, some other line items, and also reductions elsewhere, and money for the wall.\nYes, ma'am, I told you I'd come back there.\nQ: Can you speak to how you try to balance policy? The President also talked about projecting strength in the world. So if you have this dramatic reduction at State, and sometimes foreign aid is used to try to bring stability to parts of the world that could be a threat, how did you find that balance so that 28 percent, which sounds so substantial, where are you comfortable with the potential risk of reducing that aid?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. There's no question this is a hard-power budget. It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally. The President very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong power administration. So you have seen money move from soft-power programs, such as foreign aid, into more hard-power programs. That's what our allies can expect, that's what our adversaries can expect, that's what the President wanted us to relay. And I think we've done an effective job of that.\nQ: Is he (inaudible)?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I implement the President's policies. The President decides what he wants to do, and we put it into practice, and that's what this budget does.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Sir, you talked about the budget being an \"America First\" budget and taking what the President campaigned on on the trail, and turning that into budgetary policy. And one agency you haven't mentioned is HUD, but we understand there's going to be some significant cuts in HUD, as well. Can you just explain how the President's promise on the campaign trail to fix the inner cities and rebuild a lot of those communities fits with cutting grant programs and other housing programs?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. A couple different answers to that. First off, one of the other things the President said was he was going to go after wasteful programs, duplicative programs, programs that simply don't work. And a lot of those are in HUD. We've spent a lot of money on Housing and Urban Development over the last decades without a lot to show for it. Certainly there are some successes, but there's a lot of programs that simply cannot justify their existence, and that's where we zeroed in.\nTo the larger issue about how do you want to work with the inner cities, a lot of the other President's policies -- education, for example -- speak to his work that he wants to see done in the inner cities. Plus, don't discount -- by the way, this is a larger point -- don't discount the infrastructure program, as well. You will see reductions, for example, in other agencies on infrastructure programs. And people might say, well, goodness gracious, that doesn't line up with what the President said about a commitment to infrastructure. That was done intentionally.\nThe Department of Transportation, you'll see some line-item reductions for infrastructure programs. Why? Because we believe those programs to be less efficient than the infrastructure package that we're working on for later on this year. So what we've effectively done is try to move money out of existing, more inefficient programs, and hold that money for what we expect to be more efficient infrastructure programs later on.\nQ: Are you then funding any new programs that the President thinks are going to be more efficient or better or changed --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: We moved money around in HUD, but I don't think we created any new programs. Again, I talked to Secretary Carson, and he has the flexibility to move money around, so I would think that -- Secretary Carson came to us, came to the President more specifically, and said, look, you gave me this pot of money, I want to move money out of this existing program into this new idea I have. He would have a tremendous flexibility to do that. In fact, that's why President Trump appointed him and everybody else to those types of positions.\nYes, sir. In the back.\nQ: You said $1.5 billion for the wall. Is that the first step, given that this --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, it's all that we think that we can spend this year. We haven't settled on a -- and the next question is going to be, how many miles of wall does that build, right? And we don't know the answer to that question because we haven't settled on construction types. We haven't settled on where we're going to start. I think the funding provides for a couple of different pilot cases. I don't know what else to describe them -- as different kinds of barriers in different kinds of places, as we try and find the most cost-efficient, the safest, and also the most effective border protections. They may be different in different areas.\nSo the $1.5 billion allows us to start that program. We come along with additional funding -- $2.6 [billion] in 2018 -- and obviously when we get to that fuller budget -- the \"fuller budget,\" that's not a very good word -- when we get to the full budget in May, you'll also start seeing some projections out in throughout the 10-year window.\nYes, sir.\nQ: So all of your increases are offset on the other side. Does it add up? Or are you making extra room for tax cuts in there?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, sir. This is apples to apples. This is discretionary budget only. So if we spend an extra dollar on a discretionary program within this blueprint, we reduced a dollar within discretionary someplace else in the blueprint. We have not gone to tax policy. We have not gone to mandatory spending. We have not gone outside of that wedge. You all have seen the graph about the $4 trillion we spend. A trillion dollars of it is discretionary funding. This blueprint stays entirely within those lanes.\nQ: So you get the money for tax cuts solely out of the repeal and replace of Obamacare, or what?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, I mean, again, we're not addressing -- this is not a tax policy document. This is a discretionary spending budget. That may be a question better asked once we start formulating specific details on tax policy.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Where is the money for the wall coming from?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: From the general treasury.\nQ: Okay, so you can't give us any specifics on what programs it's moving out of?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Oh, no, it's not -- I'm sorry, that's okay. That's a fair question. The question is, \"Where is the money from the wall coming from?\" And I thought you were asking me if it was coming from Mexico, and it's coming out of the Treasury. (Laughter.)\nNo, we did not say, okay, we need $1.5 billion for the wall, let's go over and reduce this program over at Education, and move that $1.5 billion over to the wall. We dealt with it more holistically. We plussed-up the various items I've talked about, and then we went looking for the most inefficient, most wasteful, most indefensible programs in other areas. So you couldn't follow it dollar for dollar. But when you put it all together in a whole, they offset dollar for dollar.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Two questions. One, the federal workforce, in general -- can you talk about any numbers in terms of reductions?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, because it's going to up to -- there's a great deal of discretion, more so than is typical for the various agency secretaries.\nQ: Okay, and second question: There's been some leaks about Coast Guard reductions, and I just wondered, if that's true, how that squares with border security, because obviously that also helps.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Regarding the Department of Homeland Security budget, as I think I mentioned earlier, the DHS budget, I think, is increased about 6 percent. There was a leak, I think, about a discontinuation or a proposed discontinuation of a Coast Guard cutter. That wasn't -- that's not accurate. So DHS actually has a 6 percent increase.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Is the Coast Guard being reduced overall?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Again, it's sort of hard to say because the Department of Homeland -- is it a secretary or is it a director? I can't remember. It's secretary, thanks. I'm sort of new at this -- will have discretion as to how he wants to -- General Kelly will have -- Secretary Kelly will have the discretion as to how he wants to allocate.\nIn the back, with the computer. Yes, sir.\nQ: In the President's address to Congress, two of the sort of grander things he touched on were both curing diseases and exploring other planets. So with that in mind, what are NIH and NASA potentially looking at in this budget? And then, second question: Does anything in this budget assume the passage of the AHCA?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: To the last question, no. The question is, does this budget assume passage of the Affordable Care Act. There may be some places that are sort of ancillary to the ACA, where we went in and pulled them. But generally speaking, the answer is no. That would be reflected in the larger budget that we do in May.\nRegarding curing diseases and exploring other planets, the overall NASA budget, I think, is reduced by a very small number. I think it's 1 percent. Is that right? One percent. But a lot of the programs within there are actually increased in order to align with the President's priorities, and that includes some of the exploring other planets. I think we changed one of the missions to a moon at Saturn or Jupiter, but I can't remember the details on that. But the general response is, yes, to the extent it was consistent with what the President wanted us to do, and space exploration is part of his priorities. Those programs actually are increased within the NASA budget which is reduced by a very small amount at the topline number -- 1 percent.\nLast time, curing diseases -- I thought that was a tremendous part of the speech. It's something I've talked about for the last couple years when I was in the House. The young woman who was there has what we call an \"orphan disease,\" which is a disease that not that many people have, and but for federal funding, that research for those diseases will not take place. There's not enough people who have that disease in order to encourage the free market to develop a cure, because if they did, not enough people can buy it. And our budget preserves the ability to do exactly that.\nYes, sir.\nQ: When you say that anyone who seriously looks at the budget knows you can't balance it without going after entitlement programs --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: \"Going after\" is not the word I would use, but go ahead.\nQ: Fair enough. Okay, without dealing with entitlement programs. Is that -- obviously, the President has promised not to make changes in Social Security and Medicare. So are you saying he's not going to balance the budget, or are you saying, once you explain the budget to him, he's going to change his position on those?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: What I've said, and I think I've said a couple times, is that the FY2018 will not balance, okay? We are looking at a $488 billion --\nQ: I'm talking about --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's way too early, and, really, I'm not trying to dodge your question, but we've been focusing on this. We will not know where we are within that 10-year budget window, which is that traditional sort of perspective we put it in when we talk about a House budget or a Senate budget or an executive budget, we look at the 10-year window. We're not ready yet to start talking about that. That will be contained in the May document.\nQ: But do you anticipate that you are going to be able to -- and others are going to be able to persuade him to change his position on those thing, which is what the Speaker has said?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can confirm for you the President is going to keep the promises he kept regarding those programs.\nYes, sir, you had a question.\nQ: One is a rather narrow and the other is pretty broad. The narrow question is, are you guys going to zero out funding for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes.\nQ: Zero out?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I'm sorry, I was too quick with that. No, we propose ending funding, but technically what you'll see -- is that one of the $121 million ones? I think it is. Corporation of Public Broadcasting? Yes, it's -- you'll see it's an elimination, but you'll see an amount of money in that budget, and that is for -- it is actually a sum amount of money that's necessary for us to unwind our involvement with the CPB. So you won't see a zero next to it. But the policy is that we're ending federal involvement with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\nQ: Over a period of years.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, this year.\nQ: This year?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Probably next year you might see it be zero, but it may take a while to unwind that relationship. It's just the nature of contracts and so forth.\nYou had a more general comment?\nQ: The broad question was, there was a piece in the paper this week that suggested that we're in for the largest reduction of proposed reduction of the federal workforce since World War II. Can you speak to the concerns in this area about the impact on property values and the Washington reception?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I work for the President of the United States. The President of the United States, he represents the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia, and Southern Maryland, but he also represents the rest of the country. And I can assure you that we did not write this budget with an eye towards what it would do to the value of your condo. (Laughter.)\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Or Trump properties I'm sure you mean in there, too. When it comes to -- I'm trying to get my hands around when you emphasized foreign aid cut, to emphasize that phrase. There are some soft-power things the State Department does that are in concert with DOD, like military training programs or food aid that U.S. Marines go out and deliver. Are you essentially moving those things from State to DOD? Or are these just hard cuts to entire programs?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me see if I can answer it this way. It's a technical answer, and I'm not sure it will satisfy you, but this is how we look at it in the budget world. The 050 function, which is what we call defense -- there's a line item in the budget which is 050 -- that goes well beyond just the Department of Defense. There are defense-related functions in many agencies. The easiest example to think of -- and this is actually applicable to this year's blueprint -- is inside the Department of Energy is a 050 section for the nuclear arsenal. The 050 is what got plussed-up $54 billion. So it's not just within the Pentagon. In fact, we did increase the 050 spending at the Department of Energy for the nuclear triad. So to the extent your question is, are 050 functions within the State Department part of the increase, the answer is yes. But I can't speak to where individual programs fall in terms of whether or not they're 050 or not.\nQ: So when you are emphasizing foreign aid, you are not including those programs. Can you explain what you mean you think you're cutting? Or is that all up to Tillerson to decide?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: When you see the blueprint, we identify the specific names. And I don't want to get lazy, and I don't want to be sloppy with which programs are identified. But you'll see specific programs within the State Department budget that we do reduce, and that may answer your question.\nQ: A clarification. Twenty-eight percent reduction at State, is that across State or just --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, sir, that's across State.\nQ: The State reduction, do you have a dollar figure on that? And is State the largest dollar-figure reduction by any agency? What gets you the farthest along to the $54 billion?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't remember, and I honestly don't want to guess in terms of either the percentage or the dollar figure. And I apologize -- again, I just don't -- that will be readily knowable to you in the document tomorrow, and I don't want to misspeak.\nYes, ma'am, for the last one.\nQ: I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the EPA cuts and specifically enforcing the Paris climate change agreement. Obviously, the President has said he doesn't support that. What cuts would impact enforcement on that? I mean, because that goes to the Clean Power Plan, that goes to CAFE standards, and I know there's going to be an announcement today. And then, of course, there's the Green Climate Fund that the President -- the last President committed to fund. And I don't know if that was going through EPA; I think it was going through appropriations. But would that be cut as part of this budget movement?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I don't want to speak to specific line items in there, because, again, I don't want to misspeak. But I'll answer your question this way, which is that you can expect reductions in the EPA that don't line up with the President's view on things like global warming and alternative energies. So you will see a reduction in subsidies, a reduction in participation, and those types of programs. I won't speak specifically to the Paris accords because I don't know off the top of my head what that involves in terms of the line items in the budget. But to the extent there are reductions at EPA, and they are, and they are significant, you could expect that that would be one of the places where we focused heavily.\nLook, I'm going to stop this, because, quite frankly, my mouth is dry and I need a glass of water -- (laughter) -- but I don't want a Marco Rubio. But I'll be coming back again to do this tomorrow at --\nQ: You'll join Sean.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: At 1 o'clock it's Sean, and then by then you'll have that chance to look at the blueprint and ask specific questions.\nThank you all very much.\nEND 11:53 A.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Press Briefing by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney Previewing the President's FY18 Budget"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 2:37 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Mary T. Barra, chief executive officer, General Motors Co.; Mark Fields, president and chief executive officer, Ford Motor Co.; and Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123556", "text": "Thank you very much. It is truly great to be back here in Michigan—great. And it's also wonderful to be here with the leaders, workers, engineers, and suppliers of Ford and Fiat Chrysler and General Motors and many others. We have so many leaders that we just met, all of the leaders of the major car companies and the—really the automobile business. It's a great business, it's a wonderful business, but it's been pretty much hurt here. But it's not going to be hurt for long, that I can tell you. That I can tell you.\nI'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work on the CAFE standards, so you can make cars in America again. We're going to help the companies, and they're going to help you.\nThere is no more beautiful sight than an American-made car. No more beautiful sight. I love this State; I love the people of this State. And you did me a big favor, because you gave me a victory, and that victory hasn't been won by a Republican in a long time—long time. And you're going to be very happy, believe me. You're going to be very, very happy.\nDuring the campaign, I came to Michigan again and again, and I made this promise: that I am going to fight for your jobs and fight very, very hard. I'm going to fight for Michigan workers. I'm going to fight to keep the automobile production in the United States of America, not outside—in the United States. And by the way, for those that have any doubts, many other industries do. That's okay, right?\nSo we're here not simply to honor the past, but to devote ourselves to a new future of American automotive leadership. We want to be the car capital of the world again. We will be. And it won't be long, believe me. And by the way, we're going to have a very big announcement next week having to do with your industry. Very, very big. Very important. Everybody is saying, \"What is it?\" Let's keep them—let's keep them guessing back there. [Laughter]\nYou've heard me say the words, and I'll repeat them right now: buy American and hire American. It's not just a motto, it's a pledge. It's a pledge to the working people of this country: The era of economic surrender for the United States is over. It's over. And you see what's already been happening: plants are coming back; other plants that were expected to be built in other countries are not being built. I just want to tell the leaders, they made some very wise decisions. [Laughter] Very wise. Very wise. Some plants that were announced, they're not going to be built. They're smart.\nWe're going to stand up to foreign cheating. We're going to crack down on currency manipulation. And yes, we're going to use the full economic powers of our country to protect our workers and to protect our jobs.\nLet me also say how important it is for me that we have every segment of this great American industry represented in our audience today. We have everybody. To succeed as a country, we have to work together. We have to fight, side by side, to protect our industry and to stop the jobs from leaving our country. Not going to happen anymore, folks. We've gone through it for many, many years, decades. Not going to happen anymore. And if it is, there's consequences to pay for the companies that desert us and fire our employees. There are consequences.\nAlready, we're seeing jobs coming back. Since my election, Ford has announced 700 new jobs coming back to their plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. Fiat Chrysler has announced that they will create 2,000 new jobs in Michigan and Ohio. And just today—breaking news—General Motors announced that they're adding or keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan, and that's going to be over the next 12 months. And that's just the beginning, folks. In fact, I told them, that's peanuts, that's peanuts. We're going to have a lot more. They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants.\nMy administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations, to lower the job-crushing taxes, and to ensure a level playing field for all American companies and workers.\nBefore NAFTA went into effect—by the way, NAFTA, a total disaster—there were 280,000 autoworkers in Michigan. Today, that number is roughly 165,000 and would have been heading down big league if I didn't get elected, I will tell you that right now. That I can tell you. Plenty of things were stopped in their tracks. They were stopped in their tracks. A lot of bad things were going to happen. A lot of places were going to get built that aren't going to get built right now in other locations.\nThe number of auto plants in the State has been cut by a third. Motor City once set the standard of living for the Nation. Now it has suffered under the decades of failed economic decisions that have stripped our country of its jobs and of its wealth.\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership—another disaster—threatened States like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and so many others with the loss of countless more jobs. That is why I'm proud to say I followed through on my promise—and by the way, many other promises. You've seen what's happened. Many. And immediately withdrew the United States from the TPP. I kept my word. The assault on the American auto industry, believe me, is over. It's over. Not going to have it anymore.\nWe are setting up a Task Force in every Federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production and any other kind of production, including the production of high-end, low-end, big, small, every form of automobile and truck.\nDuring my first week in office, I brought American auto companies to the White House. Mary Barra is here. Mark Fields is here. Sergio is here, and others. And none of them ever got to see the Oval Office before, because nobody took them into the Oval Office—our Presidents. They employ tens of thousands of people, but I brought them into the Oval Office because they're going to be expanding their companies.\nBut they all told me the same thing. They explained that the previous administration promised you a so-called \"mid-term review\" of the Federal fuel efficiency standards. It was necessary because the standards were set far into the future, way, way into the future. If the standards threatened auto jobs, then commonsense changes could have and should have been made.\nJust days before my Inauguration, the previous administration cut short the promised mid-term review in an eleventh-hour executive action. Today I am announcing that we are going to cancel that executive action. We are going to restore the originally scheduled mid-term review, and we are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories. We're going to be fair. We're going to be fair.\nThis is an issue of deep importance to me. For decades, I've raised the alarm over unfair foreign trade practices that have robbed communities of their wealth and robbed our people of their ability to provide for their families. They've stolen our jobs, they've stolen our companies, and our politicians sat back and watched, hopeless. Not anymore.\nAs a private citizen, I looked, really with sadness, as massive shipments of foreign cars have been dumped onto our shores while those same countries have shut their borders to our cars. We take them—\"Come on in, folks. Come on in. No tax. Don't worry about it.\" We make cars; they don't take us. Not anymore.\nSince NAFTA was approved, we've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs in the United States. Since China entered the World Trade Organization, we've lost 60,000 factories. Hard to believe. Our trade deficit last year reached nearly $800 billion. Who's making these deals? I can take anybody in the audience; you'll do better, believe me. [Laughter]\nThese statistics really should have shaken up Washington to do action, but nothing happened. But something did happen—happened on November 8. Believe me, it happened. It happened for you.\nBut the politicians made excuses. They have said these chronic trade deficits have helped us to win friends abroad. I don't want friends abroad if that's what it's going to take. We don't need friends abroad for that. Do you ever see that, where they said, \"No, no, it's good for us because people like us abroad\"? They don't like us; they think we're stupid, people. [Laughter]\nBut no friendship is strengthened through economic abuse, because we have been abused. And no country can long lead the free world if it does not protect its industries and care for its people and protect its borders. America will be respected again, and you, as workers, will be respected again. Believe me, you will be respected again. Soon. Now. I think it's already happened.\nOur great Presidents, from Washington to Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln, all understood that a great nation must protect its manufacturing, must protect itself from the outside. Today I will be visiting the home of Andrew Jackson on the 250th anniversary of his birth. And they say my election was most similar to his, 1828. That's a long time ago. Usually, they go back like to this one or that one, 12 years ago, 16. I mean, 1828, that's a long way. [Laughter] That's a long time ago.\nIn supporting tariffs, Jackson said, \"I look at the tariff with an eye to the proper distribution of labor, and to revenue, and with a view to discharge our national debt.\" We owe $20 trillion—$20 trillion with our policies. America cannot be a wealthy country if special interests game the system to profit from the exodus of our companies and from the exodus of our jobs.\nWe must embrace a new economic model. Let's call it the American Model. Under this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses. But, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America. They have to hire and grow in our country. That is how we will succeed and grow together—American workers and American industry side-by-side. Nobody can beat us, folks. Nobody can beat us. Because whether we are rich or poor, young or old, Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. Great Americans of all backgrounds built the Arsenal of Democracy, including the legendary Rosie the Riveter, who worked here at Willow Run. You know that. Seventy-five years ago, during the Second World War, thousands of American workers filled this very building to build the great new airplanes—the B-24 Liberator. At peak production—listen to this; it's not the country that we've been watching over the last 20 years—they were building one B-24 every single hour. We don't hear that. We don't hear that—we don't hear that anymore, do we? We'll be back. We'll be back soon. Most amazing people.\nAnd while that's incredible, it's a tribute really to the teamwork, determination, and patriotism that lives on today in each and every one of you. Great people. You're great people.\nNow, these hundreds of acres that defended our democracy are going to help build the cars and cities of the future. So I ask you—that's fine because you're right—[laughter]—so I ask you today to join me in daring to believe that this facility, this city, and this Nation will once again shine with industrial might.\nI am asking you to place your faith in the American worker and these great American companies. I'm also asking you to respect and place your faith in companies from foreign lands that come here to build their product. We love them too, right? We love them too.\nI'm asking all of the companies here today to join us in this new Industrial Revolution. Let us put American workers, American families, and American dreams first once again.\nMay God bless the American worker. May God bless the Motor City. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Remarks at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan"}

Haslam of Tennessee.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123555", "text": "Thank you very much. Wow. What a nice—what a nice visit this was. Inspirational visit, I have to tell you. I'm a fan. I'm a big fan.\nI want to thank Howard Kittell, Frances Spradley of the Andrew Jackson Foundation, and all of the Foundation's incredible employees and supporters for preserving this great landmark, which is what it is. It's a landmark of our national heritage.\nAnd a special thank you to Governor Bill Haslam and his incredible wife, who—we just rode over together—and Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, two great friends of mine, been a big, big help. Both incredible guys.\nIn my address to Congress, I looked forward to 9 years, to the 250th anniversary of American independence. Today I call attention to another anniversary: the 250th birthday of the very great Andrew Jackson. And he loved Tennessee, and so do I—to tell you that.\nOn this day in 1767, Andrew Jackson was born on the backwoods soil of the Carolinas. From poverty and obscurity, Jackson rose to glory and greatness, first as a military leader and then as the seventh President of the United States. He did it with courage, with grit, and with patriotic heart. And by the way, he was one of our great Presidents.\nJackson was the son of the frontier. His father died before he was born. His brother died fighting the British in the American Revolution. And his mother caught a fatal illness while tending to the wounded troops. At the age of 14, Andrew Jackson was an orphan, and look what he was able to do. Look what he was able to build.\nIt was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite. Does that sound familiar to you? [Laughter] I wonder why they keep talking about Trump and Jackson, Jackson and Trump. Oh, I know the feeling, Andrew. [Laughter]\nCaptured by the Redcoats and ordered to shine the boots of a British officer, Jackson simply refused. The officer took his saber and slashed at Jackson, leaving gashes in his head and hand that remained permanent scars for the rest of his life. These were the first and far from the last blows that Andrew Jackson took for his country that he loved so much.\nFrom that day on, Andrew Jackson rejected authority that looked down on the common people: first as a boy, when he bravely served the Revolutionary cause; next, as the heroic victor at New Orleans where his ragtag—and it was a ragtag—militia, but they were tough, and they drove the British imperial forces from America in a triumphant end to the War of 1812—he was a real general, that one; and finally, as President, when he reclaimed the people's government from an emerging aristocracy.\nJackson's victory shook the establishment like an earthquake. Henry Clay, Secretary of State for the defeated President John Quincy Adams, called Jackson's victory \"mortifying and sickening\". Oh, boy, does this sound familiar. [Laughter] Have we heard this? [Laughter] This is terrible. He said there had been \"no greater calamity\" in the Nation's history. The political class in Washington had good reason to fear Jackson's great triumph. \"The rich and powerful,\" Jackson said, \"too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.\" Jackson warned they had turned government into an \"engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many.\"\nAndrew Jackson was the people's President, and his election came at a time when the vote was finally being extended to those who did not own property. To clean out the bureaucracy, Jackson removed 10 percent of the Federal workforce. He launched a campaign to sweep out government corruption totally. He didn't want government corruption. He expanded benefits for veterans. He battled the centralized financial power that brought influence at our citizens' expense. He imposed tariffs on foreign countries to protect American workers. That sounds very familiar. Wait till you see what's going to be happening pretty soon, folks. [Laughter] It's time. It's time.\nAndrew Jackson was called many names, accused of many things, and by fighting for change, earned many, many enemies. Today, the portrait of this orphan son who rose to the Presidency hangs proudly in the Oval Office, opposite the portrait of another great American, Thomas Jefferson. I brought the Andrew Jackson portrait there. Right behind me, right—boom—over my left shoulder.\nNow I'm honored to sit between those two portraits and to use this high office to serve, defend, and protect the citizens of the United States. It is my great honor. I will tell you that.\nFrom that desk I can see out the wonderful, beautiful, large great window to an even greater magnolia tree, standing strong and tall across the White House lawn. That tree was planted there many years ago, when it was just a sprout carried from these very grounds. Came right from here. Beautiful tree.\nThat spout was nourished, it took root, and on this, his 250th birthday, Andrew Jackson's magnolia is a sight to behold. I looked at it, actually, this morning. Really beautiful.\nBut the growth of that beautiful tree is nothing compared to the growth of our beautiful nation. That growth has been made possible because more and more of our people have been given their dignity as equals under law and equals in the eyes of God.\nAndrew Jackson as a military hero and genius and a beloved President. But he was also a flawed and imperfect man, a product of his time. It is the duty of each generation to carry on the fight for justice. My administration will work night and day to ensure that the sacred rights which God has bestowed on His children are protected for each and every one of you, for each and every American.\nWe must all remember Jackson's words: that in \"the planter, the farmer, the mechanic, and the laborer,\" we will find muscle and bone of our country. So true. So true.\nNow, we must work in our time to expand—and we have to do that, because we have no choice—we're going to make America great again, folks; we're going to make America great again—to expand the blessings of America to every citizen in our land. And when we do, watch us grow. Watch what's happening. You see it happening already. You see it with our great military. You see it with our great markets. You see it with our incredible business people. You see it with the level of enthusiasm that they haven't seen in many years. People are proud again of our country. And you're going to get prouder and prouder and prouder, I can promise you that. And watch us grow. We will truly be one Nation, with deep roots, a strong core, and a very new springtime of American greatness yet to come.\nAndrew Jackson, we thank you for your service. We honor you for your memory. We build on your legacy. And we thank God for the United States of America.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Remarks on the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Andrew Jackson in Nashville, Tennessee"}

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. So we're just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up. This is some crowd. You have to see what's outside; you wouldn't even believe it. [Applause] Unbelievable.\nSo I'm thrilled to be here in Nashville, Tennessee, the home of country music, Southern hospitality, and the great President Andrew Jackson. I just came from a tour of Andrew Jackson's home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth. Jackson's life was devoted to one very crucial principle: He understood that real leadership means putting America first.\nBefore becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your State in the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia. Tough cookies. Tough cookies.\nSo let's begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans. [Applause] The veterans.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Amazing. Amazing. There's no place I'd rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hard-working citizens of our country. I would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly—or reporters from Washington, DC.\nIt's patriotic Americans like you who make this country run and run well. You pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars. All you want is a Government that shows you the same loyalty in return. It's time that Washington heard your voice, and believe me, on November 8, they heard your voice.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nThe President. The forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me. I want to thank so many of your State leaders: State Party Chairman Scott Golden; Congressman Scott DesJarlais; Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn; Congresswoman Diane Black; Congressman Jimmy Duncan—right from the beginning; Governor Bill Haslam; a great friend of mine, Senator Bob Corker; an incredible guy, respected by all—Senator Lamar Alexander; and so many more. Thank you all for being here.\nAudience members. Thank you!\nThe President. We're going to be working closely together——\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Thank you—to deliver for you, the citizens of Tennessee, like you've never been delivered for before. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are going to reduce your taxes—big league. Big. Big. I want to start that process so quickly. Got to get the health care done. We've got to start the tax reductions. We are going to enforce our trade rules and bring back our jobs, which are scattered all over the world. They're coming back to our country. We're going to support the amazing—absolutely amazing—men and women of law enforcement, protect your freedoms, and defend the Second Amendment. And we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag.\nIt's been a little over 50 days since my Inauguration, and we've been putting our America First agenda very much into action. You see what's happening. We're keeping our promises. In fact, they have signs: \"He's Kept His Promise.\" They're all over the place. I have. We have done far more, I think maybe more than anybody's done in this office in 50 days. That I can tell you.\nAnd we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court Justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated Federal bureaucracy—and I mean bloated—while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military: bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.\nWe believe—especially the people in Tennessee, I know you people so well—in peace through strength. That's what we're going to have. And we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share. They have to pay. We've begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing Federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before—slash, slash. We're going to protect the environment, we're going to protect people's safeties, but let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we're going to bring it down to where it should be.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Okay, let's go. One person—and they'll be the story tomorrow—did you hear there was a protester?\nWe're going to put our miners back to work. We're going to put our auto industry back to work. Already, because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we haven't seen in many, many decades.\nIn the first two job reports since I took the oath of office, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, it's just beginning. I've already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. A lot of jobs.\nI've also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel. They want to build them here, they use our steel. We believe in two simple rules: buy American and hire American.\nOn trade, I've kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster. Tennessee has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever in history.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Our Nation has lost over 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization—60,000. Think of that. More than that. We're not going to let it happen anymore. From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies. And if America does what it says, and if your President does what I've been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks. Not even close.\nIf a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences. That's what we have borders for. And by the way, aren't our borders getting extremely strong? Very strong.\nAudience members. Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Don't even think about it. We will build the wall. Don't even think about it. In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid. We had hundreds of bidders. Everybody wants to build our wall. [Laughter] Usually, that means we're going to get a good price. We're going to get a good price, believe me. We're going to build the wall.\nSome of the fake news said, I don't think Donald Trump wants to build the wall. Can you imagine if I said we're not going to build a wall? Fake news. It's fake, fake news. Fake news, folks, a lot of fake.\nNo, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are. It's under design, and you're going to see some very good things happening. But the border by itself right now is doing very well. It's becoming very strong. General Kelly has done a great job—General Kelly.\nMy administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States. Our southern border will be protected always. It will have the wall. Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon. You're already seeing what's going on. The drugs are pouring into our country, folks. They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we're going to stop it. We're not going to be playing games. Not going to be playing games. Following my Executive action—and don't forget, we've only been here for like, what, 50 days?—we've already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; 61 percent—61 percent—since Inauguration Day—61 percent. Think of that.\nAnd now people are saying, we're not going to go there anymore because we can't get in. So it's going to get better and better. We've got to stop those drugs, though. We've got to stop those drugs.\nDuring the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our Government refused to enforce our already existing laws. These American victims were ignored by the media. They were ignored by Washington. But they were not ignored by me, and they're not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored, certainly any longer. Not going to happen.\nAs we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers, and criminals preying on our citizens. One by one—you're reading about it, right?—they're being thrown out of our country. They're being thrown into prisons. And we will not let them back in.\nWe're also working, night and day, to keep our Nation safe from terrorism. We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino—hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts. Right now we have investigations going on all over; hundreds of refugees are under Federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons. We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS. For this reason, I issued an Executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. But let me give you the bad news. We don't like bad news, right?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. I don't want to hear—and I'll turn it into good. But let me give you the bad, the sad news. Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii—part of the much-overturned Ninth Circuit Court—and I have to be nice; otherwise, I'll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts. I'll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world—I will be criticized—I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts. I would never want to do that. A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with. This new order was tailored to the dictates of the Ninth Circuit's—in my opinion—flawed ruling. This is, in the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach. The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems—or she—or she. Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she. [Applause] When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country——\nAudience members. Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nThe President. So we have a lot of lawyers here. We also have a lot of smart people here. Let me read to you directly from the Federal statute, 212(f), of the Immigration and—you know what I'm talking about, right? Can I read this to you? Listen to this. Now, we're all smart people. We're all good students, we're all everything—some are bad students, but even if you're a bad student, this is a real easy one, let me tell you. Ready?\nSo here's the statute—which they don't even want to quote when they overrule it. And it was put here for the security of our country. And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this. And sometimes, we need it very badly for security—security of our country.\nIt says—now, listen to easy—how easy this is: \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he\"—see, it wasn't politically correct, because it should say he or she. You know, today they'd say that. [Laughter] But that's all right. Actually, that's the only mistake they made—\"as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\" In other words, if he thinks there's danger out there, he or she—whoever is President—can say, I'm sorry, folks, not now, please. We've got enough problems.\nWe're talking about the safety of our Nation, the safety and security of our people. Now, I know you people aren't skeptical people, because nobody would be that way in Tennessee. Right? Nobody, not Tennessee. You don't think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you? No.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. This ruling makes us look weak, which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me. Just look at our borders. We're going to fight this terrible ruling. We're going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court. We're going to win. We're going to keep our citizens safe. And regardless, we're going to keep our citizens safe, believe me. Even liberal Democratic lawyer Alan Dershowitz—good lawyer—just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.\nRemember this, I wasn't thrilled, but the lawyers all said, \"Oh, let's tailor it.\" This is a watered-down version of the first one. This is a watered-down version. And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place.\nThe danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my Executive order is clear. I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless. And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me. Not today, not ever. We're going to win it. We're going to win it.\nWe're going to apply common sense. We're going to apply intelligence. And we're never quitting, and we're never going away, and we're never, ever giving up. The best way to keep foreign terrorists—or, as some people would say, in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists—from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.\nWe'll take it, but these are the problems we have. People are screaming, break up the Ninth Circuit. And I'll tell you what, that Ninth Circuit—you have to see. Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions. Take a look. And this is what we have to live with.\nFinally, I want to get to taxes. I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but before I can do that—I would have loved to have put it first, I'll be honest—there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.\nIf we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your Senators just told me that in your State you're down to practically no insurers. You're going to have nobody. You're going to have nobody. And this is true all over. The insurers are fleeing. The insurers are fleeing. It's a catastrophic situation, and there's nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won't be around for a year or two. It's gone. So it's not like, oh, gee, they have this. Obamacare is gone.\nPremiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases. It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs. Remember all of the broken promises? You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. Remember the wise guy—remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people—the so-called architect—the American people are stupid because they approved it? We're going to show them.\nThose in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on health care. And remember this—remember this: If we took, because there's such divisiveness—and I'm not just talking now, with me. There was with Obama. There was with Bush. The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians. I remember years ago, I'd go to Washington—I was always very politically active—and Republicans and Democrats, they'd fight during the day, and they'd go to dinner at night. Today, there's a level that nobody has seen before.\nJust remember this: If we submitted the Democrats' plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats. That's the way it is. That's how much divisiveness and other things there are. So it's a problem. But we're going to get it by.\nSo I've met with so many victims of Obamacare, the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation. At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw: the Government forcing people to buy a Government-approved product. There are very few people, very few people.\nAudience member. Boo!\nThe President. By the way—watch what happens. Now you just booed Obamacare. They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned—they're bad people, folks. They're bad people.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Tonight I'll go home, I'll turn on, I'll say—listen, I'll turn on that television. My wife will say, \"Darling, it's too bad you got booed.\" I said, I didn't get booed. This was a love fest—I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare. Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed. But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it. So we'll see. It's the fake, fake media. We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our Government.\nThe House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we're going to arbitrate, we're going to all get together, and we're going to get something done. Remember this—if we didn't do it the way we're doing it, we'd need 60 votes so we'd have to get the Democrats involved. They won't vote; no matter what we do, they're not going to vote. So we're doing it a different way, a complex way. It's fine. The end result is, when you have phase one, phase two, phase three—it's going to be great. It's going to be great.\nAnd then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like. The House legislation does so much for you. It gives the States Medicaid flexibility. And some of the States will take over their healthcare. Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money—they run a great plan. We have States that are doing great. It gives great flexibility.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nThe President. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you. It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes. It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs. The bill that I will ultimately sign—and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we're going to get it done—we'll get rid of Obamacare and make health care better for you and for your family.\nAnd once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three—I'm going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.\nWe welcome this health care debate and its negotiation, and we're going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day—unlike the way Obamacare was passed. Remember, folks, if we don't do anything, Obamacare is gone. It's not like, oh, gee, it's going to be wonderful in 3 years. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. Not working. It's gone. What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don't believe you should be able to make your own health care decisions.\nI am very confident that if we empower the American people, we will accomplish incredible things for our country, not just on health care, but all across our Government. We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine. We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values. We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses and, very importantly, for our workers; we're going to lower taxes. Big!\nAnd we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing.\nNo matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home. We all salute the same flag. And we all are made by the same God.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. It's time to embrace our glorious American destiny. Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country. All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls. And we found that out very recently in our last election—a lot of pride. We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. This is your moment. This is your time. This is the hour when history is made. All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-03-15", "title": "Remarks at a \"Make America Great Again\" Rally in Nashville, Tennessee"}

(Applause.)\nThis is a singular privilege for me as I have known Senator Coats now for more than 30 years and couldn't be more grateful for his willingness to continue his service to the United States of America in this vitally important role in the life of our nation.\nWe're joined this afternoon by his wife, Marsha, his son Andrew, his daughter Lisa. And we send greetings from afar to his daughter Laura, who is watching from Louisville, Kentucky, I know with great pride in her father and in her parents and their continuing service.\nAlso very honored to be joined today by a member of the intelligence committee in the Senate, Senator James Lankford, and the newest member of the United States Senate, Senator Luther Strange. Thank you both for being here for this occasion. (Applause.)\nSenator Coats, you come here today after a long career in public service. In our home state of Indiana, you served with great distinction -- first answering the call to serve our country in uniform in the United States Army. You would be elected to the United States Congress in 1980, serving four terms in the House of Representatives, and then decade in the Senate, followed by four very distinguished years as the United States Ambassador to Germany.\nYou arrived literally -- your second day on the job was September 11th, 2001. And in that moment of crisis for the United States and crisis in the world, you played a leading role in marshalling European support for our nation in that dark hour.\nAlthough you tried to retire from public service in 2005, you failed -- just as you have again. (Laughter.) And you ran for the United States Senate in 2010 and served another term, serving on the intelligence committee. You chaired the joint economic committee, adding to the more than a decade that you served on the armed services committee in the United States Senate.\nThroughout all of your years, you represented not only the state of Indiana well, but you represented the interests of the United States with extraordinary integrity and commitment.\nFrom one Hoosier to another, I'm grateful and proud for your service to date. And I know that President Trump is grateful and proud of your willingness to serve our nation at such a time as this.\nThe President has called you to serve this country as our Director of National Intelligence. As you know from your many conversations with him, President Trump has no higher goal than the safety and security of the American people, and from this day forward, as Director of National Intelligence, you will bring your background, your experience, your integrity, and the relationships that you have built around this nation and around the world in integrating and improving the best intelligence community in the world to be even better still.\nThe President and I have absolute faith in you. You've served our country with distinction for decades, and the President and I are confident that you will continue that record of leadership, integrity, and devotion to this country in the days ahead.\nAnd so, on behalf of President Trump, it is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.) (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Ladies and gentlemen, the Director of National Intelligence for the United States, Dan Coats. (Applause.)\nDIRECTOR COATS: Mr. Vice President, thank you for a more than generous introduction. But more importantly thank you for the many years of friendship with you and Karen, for your service in the House of Representatives, on the leadership in that House, for being an outstanding governor for our cherished Hoosier state, and now being awarded the great privilege of being Vice President of the United States.\nTo know you, to know who you are, to be so proud of our friendship, so proud of you in terms of your leadership, and being part of the team that's going to do everything we can to keep America safe, to keep America prosperous, to keep America being the America that serves all Americans, the kind of country that is recognized around the world. I'm deeply grateful for your leadership with that.\nThese are clearly uncertain times. It's so wonderful to be supported by a wife of many, many years who is -- and at my right-hand side -- counselor, supporter, a faithful companion; by our daughter Lisa; by our son Andrew; and our daughter Laura, who is in Louisville, Kentucky watching hopefully this procedure.\nThese are clearly uncertain times, but I inherit an intelligence community made up of men and women who have dedicated their careers and their lives. It's a 24/7-365-day operation. And it is designed to protect Americans from threats from home and abroad. It is designed to be the best intelligence agency in the world. It is functioning well, but everyone that serves in that community say we can even do better. It's a great privilege to be able to be selected to lead that effort and to continue to be the best intelligence service in the world providing our President, Vice President, and policymakers with the needed information they need to inscribe safe policies, good policies, and lead our nation; and in fact, always lead the world as America has done since its founding.\nMr. Vice President, I thank you.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123701", "text": "AMERICA FIRST\nBeginning a New Chapter of American Greatness\nA Message to the Congress of the United States:\nThe American people elected me to fight for their priorities in Washington, D.C. and deliver on my promise to protect our Nation. I fully intend to keep that promise.\nOne of the most important ways the Federal Government sets priorities is through the Budget of the United States.\nAccordingly, I submit to the Congress this Budget Blueprint to reprioritize Federal spending so that it advances the safety and security of the American people.\nOur aim is to meet the simple, but crucial demand of our citizens—a Government that puts the needs of its own people first. When we do that, we will set free the dreams of every American, and we will begin a new chapter of American greatness.\nA budget that puts America first must make the safety of our people its number one priority—because without safety, there can be no prosperity.\nThat is why I have instructed my Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, to craft a budget that emphasizes national security and public safety. That work is reflected in this Budget Blueprint. To keep Americans safe, we have made tough choices that have been put off for too long. But we have also made necessary investments that are long overdue.\nMy Budget Blueprint for 2018:\n* provides for one of the largest increases in defense spending without increasing the debt;\n* significantly increases the budget for immigration enforcement at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security;\n* includes additional resources for a wall on the southern border with Mexico, immigration judges, expanded detention capacity, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Border Patrol;\n* increases funding to address violent crime and reduces opioid abuse; and\n* puts America first by keeping more of America's hard-earned tax dollars here at home.\nThe core of my first Budget Blueprint is the rebuilding of our Nation's military without adding to our Federal deficit. There is a $54 billion increase in defense spending in 2018 that is offset by targeted reductions elsewhere. This defense funding is vital to rebuilding and preparing our Armed Forces for the future.\nWe must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight, do only one thing: Win.\nIn these dangerous times, this public safety and national security Budget Blueprint is a message to the world—a message of American strength, security, and resolve.\nThis Budget Blueprint follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping terrorists out of our country, and putting violent offenders behind bars.\nThe defense and public safety spending increases in this Budget Blueprint are offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the Federal Government. Our Budget Blueprint insists on $54 billion in reductions to non-Defense programs. We are going to do more with less, and make the Government lean and accountable to the people.\nThis includes deep cuts to foreign aid. It is time to prioritize the security and well-being of Americans, and to ask the rest of the world to step up and pay its fair share.\nMany other Government agencies and departments will also experience cuts. These cuts are sensible and rational. Every agency and department will be driven to achieve greater efficiency and to eliminate wasteful spending in carrying out their honorable service to the American people.\nI look forward to engaging the Congress and enacting this America First Budget.\nDonald J. Trump", "timestamp": "2017-03-16", "title": "The Budget Message of the President"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123532", "text": "James S. Brady Briefing Room\n3:04 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Sorry for the delay, guys. It's budget day. I was supposed to kick this off with Director Mulvaney. He's still on a call with the governors, and continues to host a ton of briefings today with key stakeholders. And so my goal, if this times out right, is that as we finish up, Director Mulvaney will walk in the room, right on cue, and then he will talk to you a little bit about the budget, and we'll walk through Q&A on that. So hopefully this all works.\nI'm going to skip past the part where I say \"thank you, Director Mulvaney.\" (Laughter.)\nAs the Director will say, the President's budget blueprint keeps his promise to put America's security first, turning his words directly into policies that restore respect for our citizens' hard-earned tax dollars.\nThere were some additional non-events -- non-budget events of the day. This morning, the President had a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland. Our two nations have a long history, common values, and important economic ties.\nThe President was honored to host him here in the Oval Office and recommit to strong social, political, and economic relations between the U.S. and Ireland.\nThis afternoon, the President made the remarks at the Friends of Ireland Luncheon at the Capitol. This traditional lunch celebrating America's bipartisan commitment to peace and security in Ireland was started in 1983 by President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill -- both proud Irish Americans -- and has been attended by every President, Speaker, and Taoiseach of Ireland since then.\nAnd also, while at the Capitol this afternoon, right around now, the Vice President is swearing in former Senator Dan Coats as the next Director of National Intelligence in his ceremonial office. Former Senator Coats has clearly demonstrated the deep subject -- the subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community, and the President is finally glad have him on board as part of him team.\nLater this evening, the President, along with Taoiseach Kenny, will attend the St. Patrick's Day Reception and participate in the annual Shamrock Ceremony. Since 1952, the President has invited the Taoiseach to come to the White House in celebration of St. Patrick's Day, where they present a bowl of shamrocks as a symbol of the profound and lasting relationship between the two countries. The President and Taoiseach Kenny will also make remarks.\nI have a few more notes before I get to Director Mulvaney. First, I wanted to share with you guys -- it's a letter that should be going out shortly, if it hasn't already, that the President signed this morning, wishing Ray Chavez, the oldest living survivor of Pearl Harbor, a happy 105th birthday.\nOur nation owes Mr. Chavez's generation -- a Great Generation -- a debt of gratitude for an extraordinary legacy of liberty and freedom around the world, fighting to ensure security and prosperity for millions. A copy of the letter will be sent out, if it hasn't already. And obviously, we all extend our warm wishes to Ray and his family and they celebrate his 105th. And the President signed the letter wishing that he hopes to have several more birthdays to come.\nThis afternoon, the President announced his intent to nominate several individuals to key posts at the Department of Defense: Robert Daigle as Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation; Elaine McCusker as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense; David Norquist as Under Secretary of Defense and Comptroller; Kenneth Rapuano as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security; Patrick Shanahan as Deputy Secretary of Defense; and David Joel Trachtenberg as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.\nThe President is glad to have these extremely qualified men and women on board to assist Secretary Mattis as he undertakes the great rebuilding of our nation's military.\nAlso this afternoon, the President declared a major disaster in the State of California and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides this January.\nWe also announced this afternoon that Second Lady Karen Pence will lead the Presidential Delegation to the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria.\nThe House Budget Committee met earlier this morning and approved the American Health Care Act, making it now the third committee to move the AHCA forward. We're working hand in glove with the House to consider improvements, and we're confident that this thoughtful and thorough process will lead to legislation that reforms our healthcare, making it affordable and accessible to every American.\nSince we won't have a chance to meet tomorrow in light of the President and Chancellor Merkel's press conference, I wanted to quickly walk you through a couple of events on the President's schedule.\nTomorrow, of course, the President will welcome German Chancellor Merkel here to the White House, a rescheduling from the snow, inclement weather that prevented that from happening the other day. The President and the Chancellor will have a series of meetings and then will host a roundtable focusing on the importance of vocational training with both American and German business leaders.\nThey will also have a press conference in the afternoon. We'll have details on the entire day later this afternoon.\nAlso tomorrow, the President will attend a listening session with Veterans Affairs and VA Secretary Shulkin and representatives from the various Veterans Service Organizations.\nIt's incredibly important to the President that we reform the VA system so that it can fulfill the promises made to the men and women who risked their lives for our nation. He looks forward to discussing potential changes that can help improve the Veterans Administration.\nOn Monday, the President will meet with Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft. He'll also have lunch with the Vice President and a meeting with the Secretary of State.\nLater that afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq to the White House.\nAnd on Wednesday, the President has invited all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to come to the White House for a meeting. The President looks forward to welcoming [them] for what he hopes will be a productive discussion.\nAnd I also want to remind everyone that -- I did yesterday, via Twitter -- that the lottery for the 139th Annual White House Easter Egg Roll is open until Saturday -- this coming Saturday. Everyone who is interested in attending can go to Recreation.gov. Further information is at WhiteHouse.gov for details.\nAt his rally last night, the President addressed the decision by the federal district court in Hawaii to block his lawful executive order. As the President said last night, \"The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems it to be necessary in the national interest...\" The Court didn't even bother to quote the relevant statute in its opinion, which could have plainly shown that the President clearly has this authority.\nI know you've heard it before, but since the Court didn't, let me quote it again for you. 8 U.S. Code 1182 states: \"Whenever the President finds [that] the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he [shall] deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem [to be] appropriate.\"\nThe Department of Justice said in a statement that they \"strongly disagree[s] with the federal district court's ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and [in] scope.\" DOJ continued, \"The President's executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation's security, and the Department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts.\"\nThe Department is exploring all available options to vigorously defend this executive order. We intend to appeal the flawed rulings. Currently, the Department of Justice is determining the legal strategy and timing. We expect action to be taken soon to appeal the ruling in the 4th Circuit and to seek clarification of the order prior to appeal in the 9th Circuit.\nThe danger is real, and the law is clear. The President was elected to change our broken immigration system, and he will continue to exercise his constitutional authority and presidential responsibility to protect our nation.\nAnd just before I get to your questions, and then before we'll introduce Director Mulvaney, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that have come up recently.\nJon Decker asked multiple times on the enforcement of the President's executive order to restrict lobbying activities of executive branch employees, which includes a five-year ban on lobbying agencies where you've served and a lifetime ban on lobbying from foreign governments.\nI said I'd get back to Jon, so here we go. The executive order itself has a section, Section 5, which focuses on enforcement. The order outlines that each agency head is tasked with working with the Office of Government Ethics to establish procedures for determining potential violations of the ethics pledge. Should a violation be determined, the executive order authorizes the Department of Justice to enforce the order through several mechanisms: debarment proceedings -- these would restrict an individual or his or her associated entities from doing business with the federal government; seeking an injunction, such as a restraining order from lobbying for 10 years -- the five years in the ethics agreement plus an additional five years; or civil penalties such as a fine commensurate with the nature of the violation.\nThe President fully expects the Department of Justice to vigorously enforce this executive order.\nAlso yesterday several of you asked where the House is in regard to additional legislation as outlined in the third prong of the AHCA and the President's plan to reform healthcare. I'm pleased to note that last night Leader McCarthy in the House introduced four pieces of legislation that will remove burdensome regulations, lower costs, and increase access as we've noted: the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, H.R. 372, which eliminates anti-trust protection for an insurance provider, creating competition so that Americans are not left with just one choice for healthcare coverage; the Small Business Health Fairness Act, H.R. 1101, which allows small businesses to band together and negotiate lower prices; the Protecting Access to Care Act, H.R. 1215, which limits frivolous lawsuits that unnecessarily drive up healthcare costs; and the Self-Insurance Protection Act, H.R. 1304, which protects workers who get their healthcare coverage from employers that self-insure by providing a backstop on catastrophic losses.\nAnd finally, in terms of following up from yesterday, in regard to the DOJ's indictments of Russian hackers on Yahoo data, this action demonstrates the United States' commitment to identifying cyber criminals and bringing them to justice, no matter where they are. It also highlights the criminal importance of international cooperation to our cyber regime. And like I said, yesterday, though this is a lawful enforcement action, anything beyond that, I would direct you to the Department of Justice and the FBI for further details.\nBefore I continue, let me turn it over to Director Mulvaney to talk a little bit about the budget.\nDirector?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, and happy day before St. Patrick's Day, also known as Budget Day. Most of you heard me talk about the budget before so I'm not going to say too many things in opening before we get to your questions. But we will remind you that this is what we're calling the America First Budget. We had an America First candidate; you now have an America First President. And it shouldn't surprise anybody that we have an America First Budget. It's in the details, as we talked about last week -- $54 billion of additional defense spending. We have some more details today on where that money is going.\nWe're seeing increases at the VA, increases within the Department of Justice for law enforcement, increases within the Department of Homeland Security for things that include border security and immigration controls. Immigration is within -- excuse me -- increases within the Department of Energy to deal with a nuclear triad.\nAnd then corresponding reductions in similar amounts offsetting dollar for dollar in other programs. The largest reduction if you've seen the budget already is a 31 percent reduction within the Environmental Protection Agency. The next largest reduction on a percentage basis is within Department of State; and the other departments are reduced in lesser amounts. I think the smallest reduction we have is NASA, which is just less than 1 percent. But there again, as with many of the agencies, you'll see certain line items within those budgets plussed up.\nThis is the message the President wanted to send to the public, to the press, to Capitol Hill: he wants more money for defense; more money for border enforcement; more money for law enforcement generally; more money for the vets; more money for school choice. And then to offset that money with savings elsewhere so that all of that is done without an additional dollar added to the deficit.\nAs I've mentioned before, the budget does not balance the budget. This budget simply reallocates and reprioritizes spending as any family or business would do.\nThis budget does not -- for those of you who were not here last week -- this budget does not address the big-picture items such as policy changes, revenue flows, tax policy, mandatory spending. This is simply the topline spending budget. That's why we call it the budget blueprint, and not the full budget. That full budget, which will contain all the rest of those pieces and parts, will be released in May.\nBefore I take questions, I'm going to do something I don't ordinarily do -- I'm sure it's kind of new -- I'm going to call on the New York Times because they're in trouble. Apparently, is there a -- where's my New York Times guy? Matt Flegenheimer and Alan Rappeport -- okay, are in big trouble. I'll give you the first question but you have to deliver this message to them. They printed this morning that I am the father of 17-year-old triplet girls. My 17-year-old daughter really wishes that were happy -- really wishes that had happened, but my two 17-year-old sons are upset. (Laughter.) So if you could clarify that, that would be great. And I'll give you the first questions, if you've got one.\nSo go ahead.\nQ: We're not great at math, obviously, at the New York Times.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The math is right, it's actually the gender that was wrong. (Laughter.)\nQ: Sir, during the campaign President Trump, then candidate Trump, talked about the national debt, which of course has reached around $20 trillion. You mentioned it in your budget message this morning. Is there a plan, as the President talked about during last year's campaign, to actually eliminate the national debt in eight years? He said during the campaign it would be easy to actually eliminate the entire debt -- not the deficit, but the debt -- in eight years. Is that something that this President is actually committed to trying to do?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's a good question, it's a fair question. I would just suggest to you it's not the right time for the question. The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with the debt, it even doesn't deal with the deficit. It is simply the first part of the appropriations process. We'll send this up to the Hill now, and the Appropriations Committees of the House and the Senate -- of course the House controls the power of the purse, the Senate -- excuse me, Congress controls the power of the purse. And this will be the first step in that process.\nWe will start to address the issues of the longer-term deficit, longer-term debt in that larger budget. And of course we'll have to deal at that time with things like mandatory spending, tax policy, revenue flows to the government.\nSo again, it's a fair question, I just don't think now is the time to ask the question.\nQ: The 28 percent that comes out of the State Department, I know that you're leaving a lot of discretion to the people who are in charge there at all of these agencies for how to implement these cuts. But how much is intended to come out of the foreign aid budget of that $10 billion?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: A lot of it. As I've said before, one of the reasons that you're seeing such a dramatic reduction in the State Department on a percentage basis is not that this President thinks that diplomacy is not important -- in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. We've already seen that Secretary Tillerson has had a tremendous -- one diplomatic success already on the deal he cut with Iraq.\nThe President believes in diplomacy, and we believe that this budget protects that core function of the State Department. It just so happens that much of the foreign aid that the President talked about in campaign -- much of the money that goes to climate research, green energy, those types of things -- are actually in the State Department budget. If those line items had been in the Department of Commerce, you would see Department of Commerce having gone down by a similarly large percentage.\nSo the answer to your question is that most of the cuts within the State Department try to focus directly on foreign aid.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Yes, the budget showed a 0.8 decrease for NASA, but you've also talked about in the administration using private companies such as SpaceX, for example, for more of that. So does this show some -- is some of this going to be shifted over to the private sector? And does this show a commitment on the administration's part towards science and NASA?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It does. Again, if you go back and you do what we did, which is go back to the President's speeches, the interviews he gave and just talking to him, we tried to identify his priorities. And one of the things he told us was, look, I'm still interested in America being involved in space exploration.\nSo even though the overall topline number at NASA is reduced by a small fraction -- I think it's 0.8 percent, as you mentioned -- individual line items that deal with specifically space exploration are actually plussed up. And part of the intent there is to promote exactly what you just talked about.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Two questions. Your own experience in the House tells you that a lot of these cuts haven't been voted for before. Do you consider this budget an opening bid, and do you expect a lot of pushback, even from Republicans, on the specificity and the size of these cuts?\nAnd secondly, to take your point about the President's words on the campaign, those of us who traveled around with him remember -- he said he didn't want to touch Social Security, Medicare, the big entitlements. The fact that that's not in this budget, is that a signal that those programs are going to remain untouched? And as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said, that ignores 70 percent of spending and 90 percent of its growth over the next decade.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'll deal with the second one first, which is the President is absolutely going to keep the promises he kept on the campaign trail. Again, you will see no reference in Social Security here, no reference to Medicare here, no reference to Medicaid here or any of the other mandatory programs -- what some people call entitlement programs -- because that's not what this budget is.\nThis is the discretionary part of the budget, half of which, as you know, is defense, and the other half is everything else, the alphabet soup of government. So just because it's not here doesn't mean we're dodging the issue. You would never see in any budget blueprint that deals with the topline spending numbers Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\nTo your other question about it not being popular on the Hill -- yeah, I can recognize that. I've been on the Hill enough to know that some of these would be very unpopular. Keep in mind the President is in a unique position. I've been a member of Congress, I represented 700,000 people in South Carolina. I had my constituency. It was a district. Senators represent an entire state. We're always dealing with special interests from back home, we're dealing with lobbyists from back home.\nThe President is beholden to none of that. The President has drafted a budget for the entire nation because that's who he sees himself as representing. He did not ask lobbyists for input on this, he did not ask special interests for input on this, and he certainly didn't focus on how these programs might impact a specific congressional district.\nBut we knew that going into it. And again, the message we're sending to the Hill is we want more money for the things the President talked about, defense being the top one, national security, and we don't want to add to the budget deficit. If Congress has another way to do that we're happy to talk to them about it.\nYes, sir, in the glasses.\nQ: James Bays from Al Jazeera. The United Nations said the world is currently facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II -- 20 million people in just four countries facing starvation or famine. And yet you're cutting funding to the U.N., cutting funding to the foreign aid budget. Are you worried that some of the most vulnerable people on Earth will suffer as a result?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: We're absolutely reducing funding to the U.N. and to the various foreign aid programs, including those run by the U.N. and other agencies. That should come as a surprise to no one who watched the campaign. The President said specifically hundreds of time -- you covered him -- I'm going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home. And that's exactly what we're doing with this budget.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Given your focus on dollar-for-dollar offsets in fiscal '18, and for your fiscal 2017 request you didn't insist on dollar-for-dollar offsets. Why is that? Why are you not concerned about adding to the deficit in fiscal 2017?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The large part of the -- the point -- the question deals with the 2017 request, which is a $30 billion -- I think it's actually $3 billion -- a billion and a half in there for the wall. And it's not entirely offset. There's a couple reasons for that. One of them is time. Another one is that some of that is what they call Overseas Contingency Operations. Now, you also know that I have a somewhat colored history with the overseas contingency operation, but I will tell you that we went through this and made sure that the money that's being requested is true OCO -- means that it's focused truly on the areas where we're involved overseas, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, those types of places.\nSo we have sent them $18 billion worth of proposed reductions for 2017, but not all of them are offset.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: The President has called for eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcast and the National Endowment for the Arts. If the Republican Congress sent the President appropriate bills that fund CPB and NEA, will he veto those bills and tell the Republican leadership to send bill that defunds those things?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The message the President sent right now is that we want to defund those. And there's completely defensible reasons for doing that. It's a simple message, by the way. I put myself in the shoes of that steelworker in Ohio, the coal-mining family in West Virginia, the mother of two in Detroit, and I'm saying, okay, I have to go ask these folks for money and I have to tell them where I'm going to spend it. Can I really go to those folks, look them in the eye and say, look, I want to take money from you and I want to give it to the Corporation of Public Broadcasting? That is a really hard sell, in fact, some of you don't think we can defend anymore.\nAs to specific vetoes, you and I both know it doesn't come over one by one, line item by line item doesn't come over. They come over in large appropriations bills. And we'll work with Congress to go through the appropriations process and we'll make determinations on whether or not to sign appropriations bills or veto them at the appropriate time.\nYes, sir.\nQ: There are several cases in the country where you're talking about eliminating some of these unauthorized programs. Are you laying down a marker there on unauthorized programs, and do you think spending discipline would be improved if Congress authorized everything that it is --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: We hope so. For those of you who aren't familiar with this, we actually spend a lot of money in the federal government that's on programs that aren't authorized at all. Remember, spending is sort -- to break it down, it's sort of a three-step process to spend money. You have to budget for it first. Then you have to authorize it, and then you have to appropriate it. But a lot of the programs that we've spent money on for years have been unauthorized spending. Either they used to be authorized -- actually, most of them used to be authorized and then they simply lapsed. And some of them were just never authorized in the first place. They simply were appropriated without any authorization.\nAnd, yeah, the message is that's not the right way to do it. In fact, we think that's the wrong way to do it. You heard the President talk specifically on the campaign trail about at least 5 percent reductions for unauthorized programs, and that's what generated this budget.\nQ: Director Mulvaney talked about this budget basically keeping the promises that the President made during the course of the campaign. For Housing and Urban Development, this budget blueprint calls for a 13-percent reduction, $6 billion. During the course of the campaign, President Trump said, specifically to urban black voters, he says, \"What do you have to lose? It turns out what they have to lose is at least $6 billion that goes to many programs that benefit those communities. What do you say to those Americans who feel that?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Nobody is going to get kicked out of their houses. What we did when we looked at the HUD budget was try to figure out a way to spend money better, and what we saw -- and I talked to Dr. Carson about this just today -- what we saw as we went through the analysis of the HUD budget is that a lot of their money got spent on government housing and building. It's actually infrastructure. And what Senator Carson -- what Secretary Carson and I talked about was figure out a way to do that better.\nAnd as we did that, what we realized was we are working on a large infrastructure program that we hope to roll out this summer. And what Secretary Carson wants to do is take the money for the infrastructure that's in HUD right now -- and not very well run -- and move that into this larger program.\nIn fact, you'll see the same line items -- or similar line items at the Department of Transportation for the same reason. These do not mean the President is changing his commitment to infrastructure. Again, far from it. What we're saying is, look, for years and years we have built infrastructure like this and it doesn't work very well --\nQ: Well --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me finish and I'll get back to you. So what we're doing now is we're taking it out of the discretionary budget and we're going to move it into the larger infrastructure plan this summer.\nQ: Housing and Urban Development and the Community Development Block Grants aren't exclusively about housing. They support a variety of different programs, including, in part, Meals on Wheels, that affects a lot of Americans. In Austin, Texas today, one organization there that delivers those meals to thousands of elderly says that those citizens will no longer be able to be provided those meals. So what do you say to those Americans who are ultimately losing out? Not on housing, but on other things that are taken out of that budget?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: As you know, or I think you know that Meals on Wheels is not a federal program. It's part of that community -- the CDBG -- the block grants that we give to the states. And then many states make the decision to use that money on Meals on Wheels.\nHere's what I can tell you about CDBGs because that's what we fund -- right? -- is that we spend $150 billion on those programs since the 1970s. The CDBGs have been identified as programs since I believe the first -- actually, the second Bush administration as ones that were just not showing any results. We can't do that anymore. We can't spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great -- again, that's a state decision to fund that particular portion to. But to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work -- I can't defend that anymore. We cannot defend that anymore. We're $20 trillion in debt.\nWe're going to spend money, we're going to spend a lot of money, but we're not going to spend it on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver the promises that we've made to people.\nQ: So you're talking about programs that do work or don't work. There's a program called the SHINE, and it's in Pennsylvania -- rural counties of Pennsylvania that provides after-school educational programs for individuals in those areas, which so happens to be the state that helped propel President Trump to the White House. I'm curious to what you say to those Americans in the community where they tell me today that 800 individuals will no longer -- children, who need it most -- will no longer be provided, in those most-needed communities, that educational care they need.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'm not familiar -- you all are at an advantage over me because I'd have to memorize all 4,000 line items. So let's talk about after-school programs, generally. They're supposed to be educational programs, right? That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to help kids who don't get fed at home get fed so they do better in school. Guess what? There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that. There's no demonstrable evidence of actually helping results, helping kids do better in school, which is what -- when we took your money from you to say, look, we're going to go spend it on an after-school program. The way we justified it was these programs are going to help these kids do better in school and get better jobs. And we can't --\nQ: To be clear, we're saying that --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: -- prove that that's happening.\nQ: To be clear, we're saying -- the administration, with this budget, is saying that no after-school programs out there are doing their job in helping educate these children?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, but I -- and again, now you're asking me a question I don't know the answer to, but I don't believe we cut all the funding for those types of things.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, you were talking about the steelworker in Ohio and the coalminer in Pennsylvania and so on. But those workers may have an elderly mother who depends on the Meals on Wheels program, who may have kids in Head Start. And yesterday or the day before, you described this as a hard-power budget, but is it also a hard-hearted measure?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I don't think so. In fact, I think it's probably one of the most compassionate things we can do to actually be --\nQ: Cut programs that help the elderly and kids?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: You're only focusing on half of the equation, right? You're focusing on recipients of the money. We're trying to focus on both the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place. And I think it's fairly compassionate to go to them and say, look, we're not going to ask you for your hard-earned money anymore. A single mom of two in Detroit, okay -- \"give us your money\" -- we're not going to do that anymore unless we can guarantee --\nQ: And that single mom has two kids -- what if that single mom has two kids in Head Start?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me finish. Unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function. And I think that is about as compassionate as you can get.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: I have a question on the border wall.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure.\nQ: Thank you for doing this. The budget, as I understand it, asked for $4.1 billion, so $1.5 [billion] for this year and $2.6 [billion] for the following year. There's no mention at all of whether or not Mexico is going to help pay for it or reimburse the U.S. for it, as the President pledged. So where is that money coming from for the border wall?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: A couple of things. Your number is correct -- it's $1.5 [billion] for 2017 -- back to your question about 2017 -- and I think $2.6 [billion] for 2018. People have asked me a couple times, does that build the whole wall. No, it doesn't, but it gets us a start on the program and you'll see some of the wall being built this year, and then obviously increased funding in 2018. But the wall will take longer than two years to build.\nAs to the source of funds, that's up to the President and the Treasury and the State Department. I'm the folks -- we're the guys at OMB and the gals at OMB who take the money that we have and allocate it in a budgetary process. So it's up to somebody else to figure out where the money comes from.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Yes. The budget for DOJ zeroes out reimbursements for state and local jails holding immigrants in the country illegally. Some of that money now goes to sanctuary cities. Is that part of the President's promise to withhold funding from sanctuary cities? And are there other elements of the budget intended to carry out that punishment that the President talked about?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Honestly, I'm not familiar with that particular line item, so let me deal with the DOJ like this -- and also Homeland, because there's many pieces in Homeland that deal with this sort of topic. You're going to see an increase in Homeland for an increase in detention facilities. It's a fairly significant increase in detention facilities because we have -- the President has said he wants to stop the catch-and-release program. In fact, he signed an executive order to do just that. And we fund that; we increase the amount of money for detention facilities for folks who come into the country illegally.\nI'll give you a follow-up because I didn't answer your first question very well.\nQ: A question about the cuts you're making to things like transportation and housing. You said those would be paid for later with other appropriations, but you said this would be balanced. And I know you've been a fiscal hawk yourself. It sounds like a bit of a shell game, though, where you're saying now this is a balanced budget, but you're saying you're not stopping to pay for other things because those will be paid for later. But then where are you going to pay for those other things? Eventually, doesn't all this stuff have to get paid for?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: And just to clarify, it's not a balanced budget. There will still be roughly a $488 billion deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office, next year. We simply didn't add to that in order to spend more money on the President's priorities. Regarding moving projects out of the, say, the base budgets for the agencies and into the infrastructure, the infrastructure program is something we've just recently started. It won't probably come until summer or maybe even early fall. We have to do Obamacare repeal and replace first, then tax reform second. That leaves infrastructure probably third, which may come after the August recess in Congress.\nSo you're making an assumption that I'm not willing to make. You're making an assumption that all that infrastructure that we provide for later on in the year is going to go to the deficit, and I'm not willing to make that assumption.\nYes, sir.\nQ: I have two short questions. One, the budget blueprint provides robust funding for embassy security --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, sir.\nQ: -- citing the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. Does that mean there will be an increase, considering all the criticism that the President and Republicans levied against President Obama for supposedly cutting embassy security?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's one of those line items that we leave up to Secretary Tillerson. He and I talked about the State Department budget and how he decides to allocate that. It may be that there are some embassies that don't need a lot more security and some that do. So we give him the flexibility to do that.\nThe gentleman in the back had a question.\nQ: Many countries around the world didn't take seriously President Trump that he would cut the foreign aid, because most of the countries getting U.S. aid were not with the U.S. supporting terrorism against the U.S., and also they were not working with the U.S. So how does President Trump feel now about those countries? Will they continue the aid? Because U.S. taxpayers will be asking that we don't have to spend on those countries who are against the U.S.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Again, I come back to what the President said on the campaign, which is that he's going to spend less money overseas.\nTo your question, though -- because this came up the other day -- which is the hard power versus soft power. There is a very deliberate attempt here to send a message to our allies and our friends, such as India, and our adversaries with other countries, shall we say, which is that this is hard-power budget, that this administration tends to change course from a soft-power budget to a hard-power budget, and that's a message that our adversaries and our allies alike should take.\nI'll take one more, because I'm sort of running down. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you explain a little bit more about what message the President is trying to send by eliminating a lot of funding for science and climate change research, as you mentioned earlier? And just a follow-up later when you get a chance.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. A couple different messages. When we talked about science and climate change, let's deal with them separately. On science, we're going to function -- we're going to focus on the core function. There's reductions, for example, I think, in the NIH -- the National Institutes of Health. Why? Because we think there's been mission creep, we think they do things that are outside their core functions. We think there's tremendous opportunity for savings. We recommend, for example, that a couple of facilities be combined; there would be cost savings from that.\nAgain, this comes back to the President's business person view of government, which is if you took over this as a CEO, and you'd look at this on a spreadsheet and go, why do we have all of these facilities -- why do we have seven when we can do the same job with three, won't that save money? And the answer is, yes. So part of your answer is focusing on efficiencies and focusing on doing what we do better.\nRegarding the question as to climate change, I think the President was fairly straightforward -- we're not spending money on that anymore; we consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. So that is a specific tie to his campaign.\nQ: A follow-up --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, I'm sorry, you had a follow-up.\nQ: Just really quick on Meals on Wheels. You mentioned that it's one of those programs that's determined had not been doing its job effectively. What evidence are you using to make that statement? And is not feeding seniors in and of itself the fulfillment of the --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: And my understanding from having been in the state government -- and I may have this wrong; I've been wrong several times today -- this may not be the first time. But my understanding of Meals on Wheels is that that is a state determination. The federal government doesn't directly fund that; it funds the central Community Development Block Grants, the CDBGs. And some states choose to take the money and do Meals and Wheels. Other states and localities might choose to do something else with them. We look at the CDBGs. And when we do that, we look at this as $150 billion spent over 40 years, without the appreciable benefits to show for that type of taxpayer expenditure. And that's why we have the reduction.\nQ: May I follow up on that?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, because I'm going to -- how Sean does this every day for an hour and a half, I have no idea. (Laughter.) But I'm going to --\nMR. SPICER: No, keep going. (Laughter.)\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) I've been up since 4:00 a.m. this morning, so I'm going to turn it back over to Sean. Thank you very much. And we'll talk to you all soon.\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, guys. Anyway, so to kick it off, Jonathan Karl.\nQ: So, Sean, the day before yesterday you said you were extremely confident that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees would ultimately vindicate the President's allegation that Trump Tower was wiretapped. As I'm sure you have now seen, the Senate Intelligence Committee has said they see no indications Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance. That seems to be a pretty blanket statement. What's your reaction?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's several things. It's interesting to me that, just as a point of interest, that when one entity says one thing that proves -- that claims one things, you guys cover it ad nauseam. When Devin Nunes came out and said, I think it's very possible -- yesterday -- it was crickets from you guys. When Devin Nunes came out and said there was no connection that he saw to Russia -- crickets. When Tom Cotton said the same. You don't want to cover the stuff --\nQ: Devin Nunes said he saw no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, hold on -- actually --\nQ: Now you've had the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, actually here's his quote, Jonathan. No, here's the direct quote: \"I think it's very possible.\"\nThat's what he said when he said the President's communications could have been swept up in collection.\nSo again --\nQ: He said there was no -- \"I saw no indication of wiretapping\" -- no evidence of wiretapping.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think the President has been very clear when he talked about this -- and he talked about it last night -- when he talked about wiretapping he meant surveillance, and that there have been incidents that have occurred. Devin Nunes couldn't have stated it more beautifully. But you choose not to cover that part.\nYou chose not to cover when Tom Cotton went out, when Richard Burr went out, when others -- Chairmen Nunes and others -- and said that there was no -- hold on --\nQ: Well, the Senate Intelligence Committee is saying point blank -- they say no evidence of surveillance.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, Jonathan. And where was your passion, and where was your concern when they all said that there was no connection to Russia? Where was it then? Crickets from you guys.\nBecause at the end of the day when --\nQ: So you're saying the President stands by his allegation that President Obama wiretapped the Trump Tower?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on. Hold on. I'm making a point. The point is this: Number one, that it's interesting how when evidence comes out and people who have been briefed on the Russia connection come out and say that there was nothing that they have seen that proves a connection, you choose not to cover that, you don't stop the narrative, you continue to perpetuate a false narrative.\nWhen he came out yesterday and said, \"I see no evidence that this happened\"; when he said, \"I think it's very possible, but like I said, we should know later,\" you don't cover that part. You only cover the parts that -- but let's go through what we do know. Okay?\nQ: I want you to respond to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, let me -- and I am trying to answer your question, Jonathan, if you can calm down.\nIf you look at what The New York Times reported on January 12th, 2017, they said, \"In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government's 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. The new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the NSA may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operation, which are largely unregulated by wiretapping laws.\"\nWhen Sara Carter reported that \"by the start of the new year, it brought with it unexpected politicizing of the intelligence gathered in secret. Separately, the Obama administration amended a longstanding executive order, allowing information intercepted through FISA warrants or by the National Security Agency to be shared by a wider audience and 16 government agencies as Obama was leave office, intelligence normally reserved for just a handful of intelligence leaders was spread throughout briefings to scores of workers, and soon leaks began appearing in news media office organizations, often in stories lacking context of how national security investigations are actually concluded.\"\nOn March 3rd, Fox News chief anchor Bret Baier said that the following: \"There was a report in June 2016 -- a FISA request by the Obama administration -- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court -- to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several other campaign officials. Then they got turned down. Then in October, then they renewed it and did a startup wiretap at Trump Tower with some computer and Russian banks.\" Baier continues, \"A June FISA request that foreign intelligence surveillance courts gets shot down. A judge says\" -- hold -- Jonathan, I'm going to -- you can ask -- you can follow up -- \"A judge says no-go to monitoring Trump Tower. They go back in October. They do get a FISA granted. This is wiretap going on and a monitoring of computers that have some ties, they believe, to Russian accounts. By all accounts, they don't come up with anything in the investigation, but the investigation continues and we don't know it.\nOn November 11th, 2016, days after the election, Heat Street reported, \"Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community had confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA warrant in October, giving counter-surveillance intelligence permission to examine the activities of U.S. persons in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia. The first request, which sources say named Trump, was denied back in June. But the second was drawn more narrowly and granted in October after evidence was presented of a server, possibly related to the Trump campaign and its alleged links to two banks -- SVB bank and Russia's Alfa-Bank. Sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full context of related documents that concern U.S. persons. Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA warrant in October giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activity of U.S. persons in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia.\"\nThey go on: \"The FISA warrant was granted in connection with investigation of suspected activities between the server and two banks. However, it is thought that the intelligence community that the warrant covers any U.S. person connected to this U.N. investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as media surrogates.\"\nOn January 19th, the New York Times reported the following: \"American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communication and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation of possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications have been provided to the White House. It is unclear which Russian officials under investigation or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigations is low.\nAndy McCarthy, writing in National Review, suggested: \"From three reports, from the Guardian, Heat Street and the New York Times, it appears the FBI has concerns about a private server in Trump Tower that was connected to one or two Russian banks. Heat Street describes these concerns as centering on \"possible financial and banking offenses.\" This is his quote -- \"I italicized the word \"offenses\" because it denotes crimes. Ordinarily, when crimes are suspected, there is a criminal investigation, not a national security investigation.\"\nWe go on. Sara Carter from Circa, reporting, \"Intelligence professionals tell Circa News they were concerned that some of the Russian intelligence was spread through group briefings to a much-larger-than-usual audience back in January. This would have happened during the final days of the Obama administration when it expanded executive order 12333, which allows employees with a \"need to know\" have further unfettered access to raw data stowed by the NSA. The new rules allowed the NSA to share \"raw signals intelligence information, including the names of those involved in phone conversations and emails. The expansion of the order makes it difficult to narrow in on the leaks and, frankly, it allows too many people access to the raw data, which only used to be available to a select few, said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was not granted to speak on the authority. Numerous outlets, including the New York Times, have reported on the FBI investigation into Mr. Trump's advisors; BBC, and then McClatchy revealed the existence of a multi-agency working group to coordinate investigations across the thing.\nOn February 14th, the New York Times again refers to phone record and intercepted calls -- let me quote them -- \"American law enforcement intelligence agency intercepted the communications around the same times they were discovering the evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three officials said.\nThe intelligence agencies then thought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that so far they have seen no evidence of such cooperation. The official said that the intercepted communications are not limited to Trump campaign officials and other associates of Mr. Trump. The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the FBI is sifting through.\nDays later, the New York Times then reports, \"In the Obama administration's last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election of Donald Trump, connections between the President-elect and Russians across the government. But the increasingly hard-to-escape conclusion that in our government -- that individuals in our government were instead trying to undermine the new President by saying, quote -- this is the New York Times again -- \"At intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence in a possible analysis to keep the report at relatively low classification levels to ensure a widespread readership across the government. And in some cases, \"among them, European allies.\" This allowed the upload of as much information -- intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret Wiki used by American analysts to share information.\nSean Hannity went on Fox to say, \"But protections which are known as minimization procedures have been put in place to protect Americans that are not under warrant, American citizens that are caught up in their surveillance.\" And, \"By the way, their identities are protected. Their constitutional rights are protected. Now, of course, this was not the case with Lieutenant General Flynn, because a transcript of his call was created and then given to intelligence officials who then leaked this information, which is a felony, to the press that printed it.\"\nLast, on Fox News on March 14th, Judge Andrew Napolitano made the following statement. \"Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA, he didn't use the FBI, and he didn't use the Department of Justice. He used GCHQ, what is that? It's the initials for the British Intelligence Spying Agency. So simply, by having two people saying to them, 'the President needs transcripts of conversations involved in candidate Trump's conversations involving President-elect Trump,' he was able to get it and there's no American fingerprints on this.\"\nPutting the published accounts and common sense together, this leads to a lot.\nQ: So, Sean, are you saying that despite the findings, the bipartisan findings of the Senate Intelligence Committee --\nMR. SPICER: No, they're not findings. There's a statement out today. They have not begun this -- as you know, yesterday, or two days ago, the Department of Justice asked for an additional week. So the statement clearly says that at this time, that they don't believe that. They have yet to go through the information. The Department of Justice, as you know, has not supplied this.\nBut I've just read off to you -- it's interesting, when the New York Times reports --\nQ: I let you do that whole long answer. Can I just ask my question?\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nQ: Okay. So are you saying that the President still stands by his allegation that President Obama ordered wiretapping or surveillance of Trump Tower, despite the fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee says they see no indication that it happened? Does the President still stand by the allegation?\nMR. SPICER: No, but -- first of all, he stands by it, but again, you're mischaracterizing what happened today.\nQ: No, the Senate has no indication. I'm reading exactly from their statement.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And at the same time, they acknowledge that they have not been in contact with the Department of Justice. Again, I'd go back to what I said at the beginning. It's interesting --\nQ: They've been briefed by the FBI Director. They've been --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. It's interesting how at the same time, where were you coming to the defense of that same intelligence committee and those members when they said there was no connection to Russia? You didn't seem to report it then. There was no --\nQ: Because --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, so you want -- hold on, you want to comment and you want to perpetuate a false narrative.\nQ: Actually, I did report that Clapper said that. I actually did.\nMR. SPICER: But when those individuals have gone out time and time again, when Chairman Nunes has said, number one, that there was no information that he's aware of that that existed, that got zero reporting. Number two, when he went out yesterday and said, \"I think it's very possible,\" you don't include that in the question mark.\nThe bottom line is, is that the President said last night that he will be -- that there will be additional information coming forward. There's a ton of media reports out there that indicate that something was going on during the 26 [2016] election. And I think it's interesting, where was the question of the New York Times or these other outlets when that was going on? Where was the question --\nQ: So he'll be vindicated. You think he's going to be vindicated.\nMR. SPICER: I believe he will.\nJim.\nQ: Yeah, you were just quoting Sean Hannity there. The House and Senate intelligence committees are quoting the FBI Director. You're citing Sean Hannity and Andrew Napolitano.\nMR. SPICER: I also quoted -- I get you're going to cherry-pick -- no, no, okay, you also tend to overlook all of the other sources that -- because I know you want to cherry-pick it. But at the -- no, no, but you do. But where was your concern about the New York Times reporting? You didn't seem to have a concern with that.\nQ: We have done plenty of reporting on all of this, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, but you want to cherry-pick one piece of commentary --\nQ: These connections between the aides of the President -- associates of the President to the Russians has all been looked at and it's --\nMR. SPICER: No, wait, how do you know all this? How do you seem to be such an expert on this?\nQ: I'm saying that this has been looked at, Sean. We've all looked at it.\nMR. SPICER: How do you know it's been looked at?\nQ: There have been --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, where is -- I'm sorry, I'm afraid to understand -- can you tell me how you know that all of this has \"been looked at\"?\nQ: You're asking me whether or not it's been looked at?\nMR. SPICER: You made a statement, you said, \"All of this has been looked at.\"\nQ: Our outlet, other outlets have reported --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, so -- okay, so when your outlet says it's all been looked at --\nQ: -- on contacts between associates and aides of the President and the Russians during the 2016 campaign. It sounds like during the context of that investigation there might have been some intercepted communications. The House Intelligence Committee Chairman did mention that, and we have reported that, others have reported that on our air and in various publications. But, Sean, what you are refusing to answer -- the question that you're refusing to answer is whether or not the President still believes what he believes --\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not -- I just said to Jonathan. I didn't refuse --\nQ: But you have a Senate and House Intelligence Committee, both leaders from both parties on both of those panels saying that they don't see any evidence of any wiretapping. So how can the President go on and continue to say these things?\nMR. SPICER: Because that's not -- because you're mischaracterizing what Chairman Nunes said. He said, \"I think it's possible\" -- he's following up on this. So to suggest that is actually -- and you're stating unequivocally that you somehow --\nQ: He said, if you take the President literally -- he said, if you take the President literally, he is wrong.\nMR. SPICER: Right, and I think that we've already cleared that up. And he said exactly that. But the President has already said clearly when he referred to wiretapping he was referring to surveillance.\nQ: Right, but it sounds like, Sean, that you and the President are saying now, well, we don't mean wiretapping anymore because that's not true anymore, so now we're going to expand that to other forms of surveillance. What's it going to be next?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, Jim, I think that's cute, but at the end of the day -- we've talked about this for three or four days. The President had \"wiretapping\" in quotes; he was referring to broad surveillance. And now you're basically going back. We talked about this several days ago.\nThe bottom line is, is that the investigation by the House and the Senate has not been provided all of the information. And when it does --\nQ: It sounds like your information is news reports, not evidence, not conversations with the FBI Director.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, what -- I think the President addressed that last night. He said there's more to come. These are merely pointing out that I think there is widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people that came up.\nQ: There was an investigation going on into whether there were contacts between the President's campaign and the Russians. Of course, they're going to be looking at these various things. I mean, isn't that right?\nMR. SPICER: I get it. Somehow you seem to believe that you have all of this information, you've been read in on all of these things, which I find very interesting.\nQ: I haven't been read in by the FBI Director, but the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have been.\nMR. SPICER: Well, no, you're coming to some serious conclusions for a guy that has zero intelligence -- (laughter) --\nQ: Give me some credit, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: I'll give you some --\nQ: A little intelligence maybe. But no, what I'm saying is that --\nMR. SPICER: Clearance. I wasn't done. Clearance. Maybe both.\nQ: Well, come on, now. Those two panels have spoken with the FBI Director and have been told there's no evidence of this. So why not just -- why can't we just end this farce and just have the President say he was wrong?\nMR. SPICER: Okay, I think this question has been asked and answered, Jim. It's interesting how you jump to all of these conclusions about what they have and what they don't have, and you seem to know all the answers. But at the end of the day, there was clearly a ton of reporting --\nQ: So a week from now, we're going to be wrong, you're going to be right?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, Jim. Let me answer -- I think that there has been a vast amount of reporting, which I just detailed, about activity that was going on in the 2016 election. There's no question that there was surveillance techniques used throughout this I think by a variety of outlets that have reported this activity concluded.\nAnd I think when you actually ask those two people whether or not -- and as Chairman Nunes said yesterday, when you take it literally and -- wiretapping, the President has already been very clear that he didn't mean specifically wiretapping. He had it in quotes. So I think to fall back on that is a false premise. That's not what he said. He was very clear about that when he talked about it yesterday.\nMajor.\nQ: So just to be clear, you're good and the President is good with stories that have anonymous sources in them.\nMR. SPICER: No, it's interesting -- I think when it comes to the Russia story, and the on-the-record sources who have been briefed by the FBI continue to conclude that there's nothing there, you guys continue to fall back on these anonymous sources and perpetuate a false narrative. And yet when it comes to us talking about all these reports in there, you then criticize the anonymous sources.\nQ: I'm just asking.\nMR. SPICER: No, it's just interesting that sort of the double standard that exists when it comes to us citing stories when it comes -- and then how you intend to use them.\nQ: So let me ask you what the President said last night. He was asked by Tucker Carlson -- \"you're in charge of the various intelligence apparatus that report to you. You can ask them.\" And he said --\nMR. SPICER: And again --\nQ: Can I ask my question?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: He said he was reluctant to do that. So let me just put two things together. Earlier this week, you told us, when asked, \"Has the President directed the Justice Department to collect and distribute information to the various relevant congressional committees?\" If I remember your answer correctly, it was, \"No, we hadn't given that specific direction.\" Has that changed?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Has he now directed the Justice Department?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And is he asking, himself, for the intelligence agencies that report to him, to provide him specific answers to these underlying questions that are separate from the reports you're citing?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Why not?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think -- we've covered this before. I think that gets into interfering, and I think that the appropriate process is to allow the House and the Senate to do this so that it doesn't appear as though we're interfering --\nQ: But interfering --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But I mentioned to you this the other day, Major. If we go ask them, then you're going to turn around and say, you guys interfered with something and you pressured them. It's a catch-22 for us. And the bottom line is, is that I think the President made it clear two Sundays ago that he wanted the House and Senate Intelligence Committee to work with these agencies to collect the information and make a report.\nThat's what we're doing, in order to make sure that there is a separation from us so that you can't turn around and then accuse us of forcing or pressuring an agency to produce a document. We're asking them to go through the process of the separation of powers, and actually going to those different entities. The Department of Justice said, yesterday, that they want an additional week, and we're allowing that process to play through.\nGot it? Abby.\nQ: Sean, is the President making these statements based on classified information?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what how the President makes a decision. I think that what I think is clear though is -- through the reporting that I just read -- is that there's clearly widespread open-source material pointing to surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election.\nQ: (Inaudible) that that information is available to members of the House and the Senate. It's public, as you noted. They are looking at that same information, and they came to the conclusion that they have not seen --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that's not true.\nQ: -- any evidence to back up the President's claim. So if there is other information, why won't the President release it?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to get into that yet. I think the President discussed that last night on his interview, and we'll let the process play out. I understand what he discussed --\nQ: He discussed these reports --\nMR. SPICER: I understand what he discussed. They have clearances in the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees. They're able to conduct this.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, I'd like to ask you about two topics, but can you help us a little by calling on Peter right now?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm going to --\nQ: Call it --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. I actually call the question. Alexis, if you don't want to answer the question I can call on somebody else.\nQ: Could you call on the New York Times, please?\nMR. SPICER: No, thank you. Gabi.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. In the case that Judge Watson issued against the restraining order against Trump's second travel -- sorry, the President's second travel ban, he included one of the President's tweets and this was also included in the Washington State case. So I'm wondering, does it give the President any pause that this virtual paper trail is creating -- is having an impact on advancing his agenda?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think that the Department of Justice's statement speaks for itself when it comes to that last night. But the federal law that I read out clearly gives the President the authority. This is what we argued during the first one. I think for a judge to ignore that statute and talk about tweets or interpreting something that happened during the campaign trail is not in keeping with how they're supposed to interpret the law. I'm not going to continue to comment.\nWe tailored that additional -- that second executive order to comply with the judge's order. I think -- so to go back now and to say, well, based on how the first order was conceived makes absolutely no sense. But I'm going to let the Department of Justice litigate that, how they do it.\nThe second order literally was tailored to the concerns that were rendered by the 9th Circuit in the first executive order. So for them to then turn around the make arguments that are non-germane seems kind of odd. But I'll let the Department of Justice do that.\nZeke.\nQ: Is the President concerned that comments made by his staff came up in this lawsuit? It shows comments by Stephen Miller, saying that the second travel ban would have roughly the same policy outcome as the first, that was the intent that that was used by the judge in that case to sort of -- to get that (inaudible) yesterday. Is he concerned that there's mixed messaging coming out of the West Wing on this ban?\nMR. SPICER: No, he's not. And I think that the Department of Justice will be pursuing avenues that will seek to remedy this. I think when you read through the court's ruling in Hawaii in particular, it just doesn't seem to make sense.\nAs I mentioned to Gabi, the second executive order was literally tailored. So to go back and talk about statements that occurred, in some cases, well before even the first one, seems to not be an accurate reading of the law. But I'll let the Department of Justice be the ones that argue this and make the appropriate legal argument.\nHunter. Olivier, I'm sorry.\nQ: I have one more for you. To go back to your long list of sort of news reports you mentioned -- one that you reached that perhaps the GCHQ: was involved. Did the President ever raise this in his conversation with Theresa May? And if that were to pan out, would that imperil the special relationship between the two?\nMR. SPICER: Again, these are just -- that happened I think two days ago. It was something that was reported on air. I think the point is, is that there's been --\nQ: Was it raised --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, it has not been raised. But I do think that, again, we're not -- all we're doing is literally reading off what other stations and people have reported, and I think that casts into concern some of the activities that may have occurred during the '16 election. We're not casting judgment on that. I think the idea is to say that if these organizations, these individuals came to these conclusions, they merit looking into.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I got a couple for you. There's a news report about the President's meeting with the Saudi Defense Minister/Deputy Crown Prince that says that the defense minister told the President about a plot, a terrorist plot against the United States. Did that happen? What's the nature of that? How worried should Americans be?\nMR. SPICER: We're obviously never going to comment on any kind of specific threats to the homeland. We're obviously committed to ensuring the safety of every American. But it should be no secret that we share intelligence amongst a variety of countries, and so we would never comment on a potential threat or not that existed. But we appreciate several countries that we work with closely to make sure that we do what we can to protect the homeland.\nQ: One more. Secretary Tillerson in Asia said that 20 years of diplomatic efforts have failed to get North Korea to denuclearize. That's plainly true, but the question I guess that comes up is does the President plan a break from diplomacy altogether? Are we looking now at only the use of force or some other coercive measures?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment. I think the President never takes anything off the table. That's something he's been very clear about, and -- with that.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, over the course of the campaign the President made a couple different -- many comments about the budget and the deficit. At one point, he said he thought that he could get rid of the national debt over the course of eight years. At another point he said that he would insist on a balanced budget relatively soon. Now the base line that the administration is giving us is, well at least we're not adding onto the deficit, which is nearly half a trillion dollars. So I'm curious as to how we got from that point to now, to where -- he was talking at one point about eliminating a bunch, and now it's adding onto it.\nMR. SPICER: I think Director Mulvaney addressed that. I think -- look, a couple things. Number one, the Senate dragged its feet on getting Director Mulvaney confirmed and in office. So I think we were way -- we were behind the curve in having a director of OMB. We got in here -- I think we produced a blueprint that is consistent with the President's principles and priorities. But he's already made it very clear that we'll have a budget probably sometime in May that will outline the more specifics of the revenue piece, the entitlement piece, and the full details of all this.\nBut eliminating a $20 trillion debt and tackling the current deficit is something that's going to take a little bit of time and something that the President is committed to reducing. I think we've talked very extensively about the President's commitment to protecting taxpayer dollars and using them more efficiently. This budget and a lot of the action the President took on other projects, including the F18 and the next generation of AF1, show that the President is committed on a very, very personal basis to getting involved in programs and policies to reduce the deficit and respect taxpayer money. So this is step one, and it's a down payment on that goal.\nQ: Are there future steps -- there are lots of cuts in here, but no matter which way you splice the numbers, anyone will tell you, if you want to drop it somehow you've got to get to entitlements.\nMR. SPICER: I understand.\nQ: Is that on the table potentially, yes or no?\nMR. SPICER: As Director Mulvaney put it, he was chosen for this job because of his commitment to fiscal austerity and respect of taxpayer dollars and budgeting skills. And I think that we've got to get passed today. Let us get down that and we'll have more for you.\nBut again, I think this budget is a huge down payment on the President's goal of showing his commitment to fiscal responsibility and respecting the taxpayer.\nEamon.\nQ: Sean, tax day is coming up. A lot of Americans put together their tax returns. When the President puts together his tax returns this year, will he release it publicly? Presumably he's not under audit, right?\nMR. SPICER: Well, St. Patrick's Day is tomorrow -- that's what I'm more focused on.\nQ: Presumably, his 2016 returns are not under audit yet.\nMR. SPICER: Right. Again, we'll cross that bridge when it comes to it. I think the President has been very clear about his position on his tax returns, and we'll have to see where it goes from there. But the President has been very clear throughout the campaign and consistent that he's under a routine audit.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Reading the draft of the budget and listening to Director Mulvaney's comments yesterday and today, it would appear that the National Endowment of the Arts would be phased out entirely in two years. Can you name any other government programs or even Cabinet departments -- such as Housing and Urban Development, and Education -- in which its entire function may be phased out or reduced to another agency in government or even the state?\nMR. SPICER: John, those here from OMB is the appropriate person to ask on that. I know that they've done several briefings on the budget. We can have OMB definitely get back to you on this. If you can contact him after this.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Going back to the fact that the President used \"wiretap\" in quotes, and last night he said it was very important that it was in quotes, but out of the four tweets when he accuses Barack Obama of wiretapping him he only used quotes in two of them. In two of them he specifically said that he tapped his phones. He didn't use the term, wiretapping. And just minutes ago, you said it was communications being swept up. So can you definitively say that he still feels like Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, or does he feel like it was broadly surveilled? Which is it?\nMR. SPICER: Look, he was very clear about this last night. He talked about it, as you said --\nQ: He wasn't --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, he was. He said that he meant it, he put it in quotes, it was very broad. And so that's what he meant by the use of the term.\nQ: But was it phone-tapping? Was it --\nMR. SPICER: No, it was surveillance. I think we've covered this like 10 times.\nQ: There's no specific answer of what it was. What did President Obama do to --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, but that's the point of them looking into this, Kaitlan. I think the idea is to look into this, have the House and Senate Intelligence Committees look into this and report back.\nQ: I want to follow up on that. If all this comes out and there's no proof that President Obama had any role in any wiretapping, if there was no wiretapping, will President Trump then offer an apology to President Obama?\nMR. SPICER: I was asked this like three times this week and I think the answer is we're not going to prejudge what the outcome of this is. I think we've got to let the process work its will, and then when there's a report that comes out conclusive from there, then we'll be able to comment. But to jump ahead of this process at this point would be inappropriate.\nAnd I go to Bryan Crabtree of Salem Radio, Georgia.\nQ: Thank you, Sean, for taking questions from a talk-radio host right here in Georgia and not in the D.C. swamp. First, I have two questions. First, to the President's tax returns and classified information. President Trump campaigned on draining the swamp. The American people then want to know why he (inaudible). And Commissioner (inaudible) has not yet been fired by the Trump administration. My second question is with regard to there are -- many conservatives are really concerned that Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, is leading President Trump down a very wrong path on healthcare. How do you react to that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, on the first one, there's no personnel updates with respect to -- with the exception of the ones that I mentioned today.\nOn the second, Donald Trump is not one to be led down a path by anyone. I think he is -- he talked today at the lunch with the Taoiseach and Speaker Ryan that he's working hand-in-glove with the Speaker. He talked about it last night. This is a commitment that he has to enacting healthcare. This is a process that he is committed to, wants to see through because of a goal that he wants to achieve, which is making a more patient-centric healthcare system that lowers the cost and increases the options.\nBut he doesn't get led down any path. He leads very clearly. And I think if you listen to Speaker Ryan today, he's in agreement that there's been a strong partnership between the House, the administration and I think the Senate so far to make sure that we get this bill done. And that's what our goal is going to be, and that's -- so I would argue that we've actually done a pretty good job of getting that done.\nJonathan.\nQ: I want to ask you about the decision to cut the National Institutes of Health budget by 19 percent. It's, as you know, a very important part of the government funding medical research. Budget Director Mulvaney yesterday acknowledged that the private sector can't fill that gap. When there are rare diseases, we do need a really robust government presence. The President invited a rare-disease patient to his speech to Congress to talk about medical innovation. How do you square those things when you're cutting NIH by 19 percent? And many conservatives actually wanted to increase the budget.\nMR. SPICER: I think Director Mulvaney actually -- somebody asked him during the Q&A period the same question.\nQ: But he suggested that it wouldn't -- like my take from listening to him yesterday was that it wouldn't be cut. I mean, I almost wrote that.\nMR. SPICER: There's this assumption in Washington, Jonathan, that if you get less money it's a cut. And I think that the reality is that in a lot of these there's efficiencies, duplicity, ways to spend money better. And I think if you're wasting a lot of money, that's not a true dollar spent. And I think when you look at the way that Director Mulvaney and the President approached this budget, it was can we ask -- can we get more with the same dollar, can we find duplicity, can we find efficiencies, can we combine facilities in some cases at NIH to enhance a better experience whereby we actually have an outcome that's reduced savings.\nBut to assume that because you spend a ton of dollars you're going to get a better outcome, I mean, with all due respect, you look at the District of Columbia, they spend by far more per capita than any other city in the country on education, and I think they have tremendous issues that are constantly being dealt with in their education system.\nSo to assume that just because you throw money at a problem it's somehow magically solved is a very Washington way of looking at a budget problem.\nQ: But they believe --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think part of the issues that we're working -- as the Director outlined a couple weeks ago during the passback process, is to work with them to talk to each of these agencies and departments about how to walk through their budget in a way that ensures they can continue to do the core functions that they want while finding ways to reduce waste, get rid of -- enhance efficiencies and get rid of duplicity.\nBut that is a very Washington way of looking at a problem, when you say, let's just look at how much we spend as a measure of how much we care or how much we're going to get done. And I think that the President has been very clear as to what his priorities on this budget are and the outcomes that we expect from every dollar that we spend.\nSo for being in office for 55 days, or 50-some-odd days, whatever it's been, we've had a unique ability to go forward so far and make a very strong commitment to enhancing our national security, to protect the country and to keep America safe and its citizens safe, while at the same time making sure that we don't ask for people to work harder, to spend more to Washington -- send more to Washington that gets ultimately wasted. I just don't see how that's showing respect to the American people or to the American taxpayer, especially when so many people are working two, sometimes three jobs, or both parents are working just to get by, pay the mortgage, and we're saying, hey, don't worry, keep sending more money to Washington -- and we're not going to take the time.\nBut there should be a review of all these agencies. Director Mulvaney was pointing out how many unauthorized agencies and departments and programs we have throughout the government. If we're going to do that, at some point there should be a debate on whether or not these agencies and programs are achieving their mission. And if they are then great, fund them. But if they're not, we shouldn't be asking hardworking American taxpayers to send more money to Washington to fund things that don't further those goals.\nThank you guys very much. I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. Take care. Have a good one.\nEND 4:15 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-16", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

[Laughter] And thank you to all of our friends and distinguished Members of Congress for joining us here today, a great honor. And a really great honor to be with you, Vice President Pence. You have been terrific.\nAnd all of our friends welcoming Taoiseach. That's my new friend; that's my new friend. [Laughter] This is—great guy. And, Fionnuala, you are something very special. We sat, we talked, and I think we'll—we're friends now too, right? And it's really an honor. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Fionnuala. Appreciate it.\nAlso, the delegation members—very, very special. We've spent some time together, and we're going to have a very, very great long-term relationship, as we would with Ireland anyway. But this is a very special group, so I very much appreciate it.\nWe're here today to celebrate America's commitment to Ireland and the tremendous contributions—and I know it well—the Irish immigrants and their descendants have made right here in the United States and throughout the world. The very first St. Patrick's Day parade—I spent a lot of time at St. Patrick's Day parades over the years, I will tell you that—was held in my hometown, New York City, on March 17, 1762. With each subsequent year, the Irish people marched, passed another accomplishment, and celebrated another very hard-earned success. And they have had tremendous success all over the world, but in this country they have had tremendous success.\nOver the years, they marched past the beautiful St. Patrick's Cathedral, now an immortal monument to the faith of Irish Catholics in America. They celebrated their shared success in American society with the election of John F. Kennedy. They fought for America in war and combat. And their battlefield courage has earned admiration and acclaim throughout the world. They have great courage.\nThe proud tradition that started in 1762 has flourished and is now celebrated by Americans of all faiths and backgrounds all across our very beautiful and very special land. As we stand together with our Irish friends, I'm reminded of that proverb—and this is a good one; this is one I like; I've heard it for many, many years, and I love it—\"Always remember to forget the friends that proved untrue. But never forget to remember those that have stuck by you.\" We know that, politically speaking. [Laughter] A lot of us know that, we know it well. That's a great phrase.\nThe people of Ireland and the people of the United States have stuck together through good times and bad times. Over many centuries, we have built a bond that thrives, inspires, and endures. And with us, it's going to be closer than ever before, I can tell you that.\nSo, as we celebrate our shared history and our enduring friendship, let us commit ourselves to working together, as we will, to build on that bond to the benefit of our citizens for many more generations to come.\nThank you, God bless you, and may God always bless our deep and lasting friendship and relationship. We love Ireland, and we love the people of Ireland. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul D. Ryan. Thank you so much, Mr. President. It is now my pleasure to introduce An Taoiseach, our friend, Enda Kenny.\nPrime Minister Kenny. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, Ambassadors, friends of Ireland, distinguished guests.\n[At this point, Prime Minister Kenny spoke in Irish, but no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]\nI didn't say anything disparaging about you there. [Laughter] What I said was, it's a pleasure for me to be here, along with my wife Fionnuala, to be amongst this august gathering. And on behalf of the Government of Ireland and the people of Ireland, I wish you all a very happy St. Patrick's festival for you all.\nThey say the Irish have the capacity to change everything. I just saw the President of the United States read from his script, entirely. [Laughter] I was going to say \"a change is coming,\" but—[laughter].\nPaul, it's a pleasure. And thank you for your visit to Ireland when you called to see me in Government buildings with your family and on your visit down to Kilkenny. When I had the privilege of speaking to the President on the telephone very shortly after his election, I said to him if it would be possible to continue this tradition, which began so many years ago, and he said, without hesitation, of course—followed by the Vice President and U.S. Speaker.\nThis is a unique occasion for Ireland and for its people. To have the facility of being honored by the Speaker of the House, the access to the President of the United States, the Vice President, and most of the team is something that we really do cherish. It goes back a very long way from when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan and all of the others put this together in the first place. So it's a really important day for us, and we're very grateful to stand between these two flags, united in history and so much.\nI haven't had the opportunity to present you with a particular piece of sculpture, which is entitled \"Arrival,\" by John Behan. It's a miniature—and but it's quite large—of what stands at the United Nations in New York of the tale and the story and the history of Irish immigrants after the famine years.\nSo let me congratulate you, President Trump, on your election. You beat them all. [Laughter] You beat them all. Whatever they say, elections are tough going. I know it; I've been through 20 of them myself. [Laughter] Both the President and the Vice President and this administration now holds within its hands the responsibility of dealing with so many global international issues in a world that is changing so rapidly and that is so fragile in so many respects. And I know that you will do your utmost to work in the interests of our common humanity, and you will have the prayers and the support of the Irish people. And let me say to you, on the European Union—and the work that you have to do in the times—in the challenging times ahead.\nWe discussed the kind of driver that the President uses: Titleist, 9-degree loft, Doonbeg, wind off the Atlantic. You have to roll the wrist at the top to get that shot straight. And during the course of this Presidency, President Trump will visit Ireland, and he said he would put the sticks in the hold of the—Air Force One. [Laughter]\nAnyway, let me just say a few words here about our country. We've come through a torrid time a number of years ago. When I took over the Government back in 2011, we were blocked out of all the markets, the Troika were in town, our sovereignty was gone, our hope was gone; hemorrhage of immigration, and a falloff in all business right across every sector. Now, because of the sacrifices of the people and tough choices made, we're in a different spot. Unemployment, which was 15.2, is now down to 6.6 percent and falling. Employment is the highest in 10 years. A growth rate of 5.2 percent last year. Fourth year running, Ireland is the fastest growing country in Europe. Deficit eliminated next year. Two million-plus working now. I was accused in Cork 3 weeks ago of blocking up the Irish roads with people going to work. [Laughter] That's the challenge of success, I suppose.\nIt's fair to say, as you know, Mr. President, we've got 700 Irish firms, 65 percent of the 700 firms working in America have a full-time presence in this market. And they now employ 100,000 people across 50 States. And that's because of our participation in the European Union and the confidence that our people have to expand now beyond their own shores. And this two-way conduit is to the mutual benefit of our people and of the United States. And let me say that Ireland and the European Union will never be anything but a friend to your country, to these United States here.\nAnd I want you to understand that all administrations, over the last 40 years and beyond, have worked in the interests of the fragility of our country. We've had our troubles. We've had real difficulties. And George Mitchell spoke last night at the Ireland Funds about the contribution that both Europe, and particularly the United States, made towards putting that fragile peace together. We're glad to see Ian Paisley here and, indeed, Gerry Adams, who have had their difficulties. We have put it all together and have maintained a fragile peace. And that's why it's important that we recognize the contribution made by the United States to that peace, where we have no border and where people can live their lives as one would expect to contribute to their country and their economies. And all Presidents and all administrations over the years have assisted us in that regard.\nWhile we—so we want to protect this peace process, and I know that you're going to work with us in that context also. We have agreed with the British Government that there would be no return to the border, as it used to apply years ago, with customs posts on major roads and every other road blown up or impassable because of sectarian violence that that brought with it. We have banished that. We want to see it remain banished. And the political agreement is no return to that kind of border of the past, and the challenge is to implement that in a way that works in the interests of the people North and South.\nAnd let me say to you that as a member of the European Council, what we want to do is to work with America. I believe genuinely, with Europe having created 4½ million jobs in the last 3 years, that we can work with the United States to create more employment here, create opportunities for so many millions of Americans. And it may well be that in a revised trade agenda, that we can do that to the mutual benefit of 500 million people in the European Union and your population here across the United States. We will work with this administration, Paul and Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, in the interests of everybody.\nThank you, Peter King, and thank you, Richie Neal—I know you're here somewhere—for the work you've done over the years with the Northern Ireland agreement. It may well be that it might be appropriate for the Government and the administration to have a desk here in Washington which will associate itself with Northern Ireland so that in the event of contact having to be made, that there's a voice to answer that.\nYou had in the past Envoys appointed to Northern Ireland on practically a full-time basis. I think we can work now as a priority to get this executive up and running in the next short period. But to have continued connection here with the administration would be very important, and I'm sure Peter and Richie will work at that.\nI just want to say, I had a very good meeting this morning with the Vice President and with General John Kelly. Sitting at the table, we were hosted by the Vice President in the traditional breakfast in the Naval Observatory. Didn't get much chance to eat the breakfast, I have to say. [Laughter] It's one of the difficulties in politics: It's in front of you, but you can't get near it. [Laughter] We did discuss the question of immigration, which is so important to the fabric of our people. And I know that in this country, this is an issue that the administration and the President are reflecting upon. And that's something that, again, we will work with you diligently in this regard in the two sectors that we used to have a facility for E-3 visas for young people who want to come to America and to work here. We have discussed that very constructively this morning.\nAnd secondly, as a part of the overall immigration reform that the Irish have contributed so much, it would be part of that. And we look forward to the works that will take place at the time ahead.\nI might say that when Mike Pence's grandfather landed here in Ellis Island in 1923, that the contribution had been made by so many Irish for so many years. It was in 1771 that the friendly Sons of St. Patrick were put together in Philadelphia, and one of their first honorary members was a young man called George Washington. And 7 years later, he handed the first commission to a naval officer called John Barry, who was cofounder of the American Navy. And he was joined later by John Holland, who designed the first submarine. And he was followed by Louis Brennan, from my hometown, who had a major impact on the navigation systems for torpedoes.\nAnd so many others, from Henry Ford, through music and culture, and so many other areas, that 22 members of the American Presidents who sat in the White House had either Scots or Irish blood in them. And you follow in that line, sir.\nAnd I'd just like to say in finality, this is what I said to your predecessor on a number of occasions: We would like this to be sorted. It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And that's what people want.\nI know you'll reflect on this, but I'm always struck by the American National Anthem when it's sung before the great occasions. And I suppose being an emotional Irishman, I—the hairs tingle at the back of your neck when you hear your own national anthem. But for us, you know, when Old Glory waves, and you put your hand on your heart, and you say, \"The land of the free and the home of the brave,\" ours is still as brave as ever, but maybe not as free. Because of the 4,000 Congressional Medals of Honor given out to the defense forces, over 2,000 went to the Irish Americans. So they fought in the Revolutionary War. They beat the daylights out of each other in Fredericksburg and Gettysburg and Yorktown, and other places, in Atlanta. They fought every war for America and died for America—and will continue to do so. All they want is the opportunity to be free.\nAnd this administration, working with Democrats and Republicans, I hope, can sort this out once and for all. And for future years, you determine what it is that you want to do. As George Mitchell said last evening, you can't return to open immigration, but for the people who are here—who should be here, might be here—that's an issue that I'm sure your administration will reflect on. And we in Ireland will give you every assistance in that regard.\nThere are millions out there who want to play their part for America, if you like, who want to make America great. [Laughter] Heard it before? You heard that before?\nSo I see Vicki here in front of me. We didn't get as far as the Kennedy Center the other evening. I was talking to young people the other day, they were on about all the different things that are happening in the world, and I reminded them of one of JFK's statements: \"This is our planet. Together, we shall save it or we shall perish in its flames.\" We have work to do. Let's eat.

The request includes an additional $30 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces and accelerate the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and an additional $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for urgent border protection activities.\nThis appropriations request would provide $24.9 billion in the DOD base budget for urgent warfighting readiness needs and to begin a sustained effort to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces. The request seeks to address critical budget shortfalls in personnel, training, maintenance, equipment, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure investment. It represents a critical first step in investing in a larger, more ready, and more capable military force.\nThe request also includes $5.1 billion in the Overseas Contingency Operations budget for DOD to accelerate the campaign to defeat ISIS and support Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan. This request would enable DOD to pursue a comprehensive strategy to end the threat ISIS poses to the United States.\nIn addition, this appropriations request would provide an additional $3 billion for DHS implementation of my executive orders on border security and immigration enforcement. The request would fund efforts to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, and make other critical investments in tactical border infrastructure and technology. The request also proposes funding to increase immigration detention capacity, which is necessary to ensure the removal of illegal aliens from the United States. Finally, the request funds new recruiting capacity at DHS so that it may hire additional immigration law enforcement officers and agents.\nIn conjunction with this request, I recommend that the Congress enact non-defense discretionary reductions of $18 billion in FY 2017, which would fully offset the amounts proposed for DHS and would offset half of the amounts proposed for DOD.\nThe details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nSincerely,\nDONALD J.

Vice President Pence referred to his mother Nancy Pence Fritsch.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123550", "text": "Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, good evening to you all. Fellow Americans, Irish friends, distinguished guests: I'm Mike Pence, and I'm the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. And it is my honor—[applause]—it's my honor, along with my wife, Karen Pence, to welcome you on behalf of the First Family to the White House on this very special occasion.\nIt is such an honor for the two of us to be able to welcome you here and welcome a special guest to the White House and, of course, our host to this podium for this 55-year-old tradition. Since Irish Ambassador John Joseph Hearne left a box of Ireland's most famous symbol at the White House in 1952, the shamrock exchange has grown to become a festive sign of enduring friendship during this memorable week and an eternal bond between the American people and the people of Ireland.\nNow, the Irish are one of the strongest and most beautiful threads in our national fabric here in the United States. For centuries, the sons and daughters of Ireland have come here from across the Atlantic. More than 32 million Americans now trace their heritage back to the Emerald Isle. And I say with a grateful heart and deep humility, I'm one of them.\nMy grandfather, Richard Michael Cowley, stepped off a boat onto Ellis Island in 1923. And that's how Michael Richard Pence got to serve in the White House. My grandfather, as the legend of our family says, was told by my great-grandmother that he needed to go to America. She said, there's a future there for you. He wouldn't see his mother for 25 years, and he often spoke of their separation with a heavy heart.\nMy grandfather came here, like so many generations of Irish Americans did, with a dream, but with character and with work ethic and a determination to build a family, a good name. And so he did. My mother, who is 83 years young, bright red hair and blue eyes, is still with us today, and his memory and her influence continues to define my life,\nThe truth is my grandfather was very typical of the millions that would come to these shores. He embodied all that's best about the Irish: sturdy work ethic, faith in God, love of family, patriotism. And that—those are the enduring contributions of people of Irish descent in the history of this country. It's extraordinary to think of the contributions that the Irish have made. In every single American conflict since our Revolutionary War, the Irish people have enriched America in incalculable ways, and they always will.\nAnd when I speak of those character qualities I know that they apply to the two people that we have the privilege of introducing tonight. First is our special guest. It's my high honor to invite him to the podium, along with our host. So, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, Enda Kenny; his wife Fionnuala; and my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump.\nThe President. Thank you very much. It's a great honor.\nTaoiseach, Mrs. Kenny, Ambassador Anderson, Dr. Lowe, Vice President Pence, and distinguished guests: We gather here today in the White House to take part in the traditional shamrock ceremony and to celebrate the strong ties between the United States and a truly great country, Ireland.\nI also want to extend a special welcome to a group of distinguished local political and society leaders—and they are real leaders—who are with us from Northern Ireland—great people—including the Mayor of Belfast and the Head of Northern Ireland Civil Service—that's a lot of power there. [Laughter] Lord Mayor Kingston and Sir Malcolm McKibbin, and it's wonderful to have you. Where are you folks? Where are you? Where are you? Thank you. And they're going to be having a great open championship very soon. I know that, right? [Laughter] At a great course. At a great, great course.\nSt. Patrick's Day has become a truly important occasion in the United States, one embraced by Americans of all faiths and of all backgrounds. I've been to many of them, and we love it. The shamrock ceremony is a tradition that symbolizes the bond between our two countries. It dates back to 1952 when the Irish Ambassador to the United States, John Joseph Hearne, sent a box of shamrocks to a President who did a very good job, Harry S. Truman.\nOur strong ties go back throughout American history. Irish-Americans played a vital role in preserving our Union during its hour of greatest need. So true. They played a very, very big role. Many distinguished themselves in the American Civil War with their grit and their bravery and their courage, earning the nickname, the \"Fighting Irish.\" And I know a lot about the Irish. They fight. They are tough. [Laughter] I know a lot. I know more than I'm ever going to tell you. [Laughter] And when American Armed Forces joined the fight in Europe during World War II, 75 years ago, our heroic troops first stepped off ships in Belfast Harbor in Northern Ireland.\nThroughout the centuries, hard-working Irish Americans contributed mightily to America's innovation and to America's prosperity. They often overcame great hardship—and it's really, I mean, it's like, the hardship they overcame for us, for our people, is inspiring and really helped a relatively young nation beyond what anyone really understands or knows. So we want to thank you. Just an amazing, an amazing history.\nPresident John F. Kennedy, in an address to the Irish Parliament, said that \"It is that quality of the Irish—that remarkable combination of hope, confidence, and imagination—that is needed more than ever today.\" Now, he said that a long time ago, but it's perhaps even more true today. The words of America's first Irish Catholic President ring just as true.\nWe hope confidence—and I tell you, what we want now is a lot of things, but we need that great Irish confidence—and they are confident people, aren't they, Mike? And we—and I tell you what, we all want it together to grow in the 21st century. And grow we will, as I say, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\nWe must have the hope to believe in a better future, the confidence to pursue it, and the imagination to figure out how to get there. A new optimism is sweeping across our Nation. You see that when you look at the numbers; the optimism is at the highest level in many, many years. And as America gains renewed strength, Ireland will find us to be an ever-faithful partner and an always loyal friend. We will be there for you, and we will be there for you.\nSo thank you for being here. I wish you a very, very happy St. Patrick's Day. And God bless you and may God bless Ireland and Northern Ireland. [Applause] Okay? And may God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Prime Minister Kenny. Thank you. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, ladies and gentlemen: It's a great honor to be back again in the most famous house in the world to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, the most special of days for Irish men and Irish women and those of Irish descent the world over.\nSince I had the privilege of being elected as Taoiseach in 2011, I've had the pleasure of being here in the White House each March to mark the enduring connections between our country and the United States. Fionnuala and I would like sincerely to thank President Trump for so graciously continuing this great tradition of hospitality which means so much to Irish people everywhere.\nI'm proud, sir, to have the opportunity to contribute to maintaining and developing relations between Ireland and the United States, particularly at the beginning of the new era in our country's relationship following your election, Mr. President. Let me congratulate you and wish you and your administration the very best as you begin your term of office.\nThis job, the job you hold, is exceptionally demanding and exceptionally difficult. The United States remains the most influential, as well as the most powerful, country in the world. You hold the hopes and the future of America—and indeed, the world—in your hands.\nBut let me thank you for giving so much of your time today to this visit. We had an excellent meeting, a first-class meeting this morning in the Oval Office—not there very often—[laughter]—where we discussed a variety of important issues of mutual concern. And I want to assure you, sir, of our commitment to working closely with you and your administration as you face the many challenges up ahead.\nThe ties that bind our two countries are deep and historic. And Ireland and the United States have a unique relationship that goes back to the earliest days of the original 13 Colonies. Irish-born military officers assisted George Washington to win that War of Independence. Indeed, they've fought in every war for America since then. And this very house was designed by James Hoban from Kilkenny, modeled in part after the Leinster House in Dublin, where the Irish parliament has met on our own independence since 1922.\nIt's fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate St. Patrick and his legacy. He, too, of course, was an immigrant. And though he is, of course, the patron saint of Ireland, for many people around the globe, he is also a symbol of—indeed, the patron of—immigrants.\nHere in America, in your great country, 35 million people claim Irish heritage, and the Irish have contributed to the economic, social, political, and cultural life of this great country over the last 200 years. Ireland came to America because, deprived of liberty, deprived of opportunity, of safety, of even food itself, the Irish believed. And four decades before Lady Liberty lifted her lamp, we were the \"wretched refuse on the teeming shore.\" We believed in the shelter of America, in the compassion of America, in the opportunity of America. We came, and we became Americans.\nWe lived the words of John F. Kennedy long before he uttered them: We asked not what America could do for us, but what we could do for America. And we still do. We want to give and not to take. We know the Irish have built the bridges and the roads, protected the public as firefighters and police officers. We've cared for the sick in hospitals, entertained as poets, as singers, and writers, as politicians, as judges and legislators. And as entrepreneurs, they provided hundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans, including most recently, in exciting technology companies. Two-way trade in goods is approaching $100 billion a year at the moment. Irish firms employ 100,000 people across 50 States in the U.S. And we want to build on this for the future.\nMr. President, Ireland is a small island on the edge of Europe, a natural bridge between the United States and Europe, and as a committed member of the European Union and a close friend of the United States, we will work hard with you, Mr. President, and with your administration in pursuit of strong and open relations between the United States and the European Union, including the strong trade relationships for the mutual benefit of millions of people either side of the Atlantic.\nI believe that the strong people-to-people links that Ireland and the United States have developed over the generations will help us in this endeavor. And I wish you and the American people every success and happiness in the future.\nTo Irish Americans, coast to coast, I say—in these days especially—we hold you in our hearts. And tonight I thank you again for your warm hospitality.\nMr. President, Mr. Vice President, may I wish you and your lovely families every good wish and blessing on this very special day. Indeed, I'm reminded in many ways of the dream of another American President—which Ireland will walk with you with—when he spoke the words and said, \"My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last, best hope of Earth.\" Spoken by Abraham Lincoln.\nMr. President, Ireland will help you build on that foundation to achieve the ultimate dream. Thank you, sir. And God bless you.", "timestamp": "2017-03-16", "title": "Remarks With Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland at a St. Patrick's Day Reception"}

We appreciate President Trump having us into the Oval Office to talk about health care and the improvements that are being made. The President has worked and said, \"Bring us your best ideas.\" And these are members of the Republican Study Committee who have brought those good ideas and worked in a very diligent way to ultimately get to a \"yes\" on this bill with the changes that the President has asked us to make that we're going to make in the bill. And with that, I want to lead it off to the Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker.\nRepublican Study Committee Chairman B. Mark Walker. Thank you, Mr. Whip. We're excited about today because it's historic knowing that we're getting a couple of very important things to the steering committee members: work requirements throughout the country, and also something what we call \"block grants,\" which allows the States to be empowered. We believe they should be able to hold the reins when it comes to managing their population. We also think this would provide more coverage for the indigent, for those sick, and for those disabled.\nSo we're excited about it today, and that's why we've come today to celebrate the American Health Care Act and moving forward with a \"yes.\"\nRep. Scalise. Hear, hear.\nThe President. I just want to say that these are folks that were either a \"no\" or a \"maybe.\" And we had a nice meeting, and we've been talking all during the night. This didn't just happen over the last 20 minutes. This has been going all night long.\nAnd we are doing some incredible things. I want everyone to know, I'm a hundred percent behind this. I want everybody to know that the press has not been speaking properly about how great this is going to be. They have not been giving it a fair press. The press is—well, as you know, in many cases, I call it the \"fake news.\" It's fake news. This is going to be great for people. I watch—I say, that's not the bill we're passing.\nAnd I also want everybody to know that all of these \"noes,\" or potential \"noes,\" are all \"yeses.\" Every single person sitting in this room is now a \"yes.\"\nAnd we made certain changes, and very, frankly, little—although the block grant is very important, because I want the States to get the money and to run their program, if they want to run it, because they can do it better than the Federal Government. They're better equipped than the Federal Government.\nI also want people to know that Obamacare is dead; it's a dead health care plan. It's not even a health care plan, frankly. And I watched the architect of the plan—yesterday I watched the old clip where he said the American people are stupid to have voted for it. I watched Bill Clinton saying, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen. [Laughter] And only because everyone knows it's on its last dying feet, the fake news is trying to say good things about it, okay? The fake media. And there is no good news about Obamacare. Obamacare is dead. And unless we gave it massive subsidies in a year from now or 6 months from now, it's not even going to be here. So when they say, \"Oh, more people on the plan,\" there's not going to be any people on the plan.\nI was in Tennessee—I was just telling the folks—and half of the State has no insurance company, and the other half is going to lose the insurance company. The people don't know what to do. It's a disaster. Obamacare is dead. Nothing to do with these people. Nothing to do with me. It's on respirator, and it's just about ready to implode.\nNow, we could wait for 6 months or a year and let it happen. It's not the right thing to do for the people. This is a great plan. This is going to be fantastic. You're going to have bidding at the one level by insurance companies. And remember this, remember this: Those lines are going to come out. You're going to have bidding by insurance companies like you've never seen before. Plans are going to come out like nobody has ever seen before. Plans that nobody has even thought of now are going to be devised by insurance companies to take care of people.\nAnd we're going to take care of people at all levels. So I just want to let the world know: I am 100 percent in favor. These folks—and they are tough, and they love their constituents, and they love this country. These folks were \"noes.\" Mostly \"noes\" yesterday. And now every single one is a \"yes.\" And I just want to thank you. We're going to have a health care plan that's going to be second to none. It's going to be great. And the people will see then.\nBy the way, it will take a little while, because before it all kicks in and welds together. It takes a little while. With Obamacare, it got worse and worse. Premiums went up 116 percent. They went up 58 percent. The Governor of Minnesota said that the Affordable Care Act—Obamacare—is no longer affordable. That's what he said. The Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. And he's a guy that—he's a good Democrat; he wanted Obamacare. He said it's no longer affordable. Obamacare is not an alternative. It's not there. It's dead. It's dead.\nSo I just want to say thank you very much. I really appreciate it. A hundred percent of the \"noes\" are \"yeses.\" And some of them were strong \"noes.\" Some were just \"noes.\" And we had a couple that were mixed. But I just want to thank you folks. And we're going to have a great, great health care plan. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-17", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting on Health Care Reform With the Republican Study Committee"}

Secretary Shulkin referred to H.R. 1259.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123539", "text": "The President. A special group of people. Very special to me, very important. And I want to thank you all for being here and for your work on behalf of our Nation's veterans, our great, great people, our veterans.\nWe're all united by a very common mission: We will protect those who protect us. I've been saying that a lot over the last 2 years at rallies and speeches. We will protect those who protect us, and that's just starting, because I think the veterans have not been treated fairly. And David and a group of brilliant, brilliant doctors and businessmen are forming a Board, and you've got the most talented people that I've ever seen working with you. This is—no more games going to be played at the VA.\nAnd I want to thank David, your Secretary—your new Secretary, who's going to be so outstanding. I think he actually passed a hundred to nothing. [Laughter] When I heard that vote I said, where did that come from? [Laughter] A hundred to nothing, right? Passed a hundred to nothing—for bringing your vision, experience and determination to the crucial task of reforming the VA and ensuring care for our returning heroes and warriors.\nAnd tonight I'm having a major meeting with some of the people that we put on a Board. Ike Perlmutter is an amazing man: Marvel, Disney; he's one of the great, great businessmen of our time, and others—we're having a meeting tonight at what we call affectionately the southern White House. [Laughter] Seems to be the most convenient location. Everybody always wants to go to the southern White House. So are you going to be at that meeting? You heard about it, right? It's going to be great—all about the VA.\nThe VA's mission statement is engraved in the plaques outside its headquarters. It reads: \"To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.\" And that was stated by Abraham Lincoln. That was Lincoln's pledge—called Lincoln's pledge. But for too many veterans, this hasn't been their experience at all. We've been reading horrible stories over the years, and already, David, I'm hearing, it's getting much better. A lot of improvements are being made, and it's going to change. And under my administration, it will change—very important to me.\nDuring my campaign, I outlined a detailed plan to reforming veterans' care throughout the country, and we're working to put that plan into effect. And it's moving, I think I can say honestly, ahead of schedule.\nAs Commander in Chief, I will not accept substandard service for our great veterans. Every member of our Government is expected to do their utmost to ensure our veterans have the care that they're so entitled to, maybe more entitled to than anybody. And that hasn't been the way they were treated. But it is the way they're going to be treated.\nSo again, I want to thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. And maybe I'll ask David just to say a few words.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Sure. And thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you. Secretary Shulkin. Mr. Vice President. I wanted to let you know the people in this room are some of the most dedicated, passionate people advocating for our veterans. And they are our partners in this quest to transform VA. And we really are so grateful that they're here with us standing as partners.\nI also wanted to thank you, Mr. President, for the budget. I think that you've honored your commitment to showing that this country cares about the veterans, and you've given us the ability to make sure that we are able to care for them. I also wanted to tell you that yesterday the House passed an accountability bill, and we're very, very grateful for Chairman Roe's leadership and for the House's leadership in doing that. We're looking forward to the Senate bringing a bill forward.\nAnd so, I think, as you said, we're committed to the plan that you outlined during your campaign to making the VA the type of organization that Americans want it to be, and we're well on our way to do that. So thank you very much.\nThe President. Well, that's great. And unrelated, we just had a meeting with probably 12 Congressmen, and it was an amazing meeting because they were all \"noes,\" would you say, Mike? They were all \"noes\" or pretty much \"no,\" and after 15 minutes—now, in all fairness, not 15 minutes, it was really actually about 4 or 5 days, but after 15 minutes, they went from \"no\" to all \"yeses.\" So the health care looks like it's going to be in great shape. It's a great plan. The press doesn't give it a fair read, but I've heard that before. I mean, what are you going to do? The fake news.\nBut it's a great plan, or I wouldn't be involved with it. I wouldn't be involved. So you have 12 \"noes\"—and we have rejiggered it, and we've done some great things—but the \"noes\" in every single case went to a \"yes.\" So that was a great honor, and health care looks like it's really happening, and it's going to be great.\nObamacare is dead. Some of you folks have yourselves—but you have family members that have suffered greatly under Obamacare. It's dying. It's just about on its last legs. If we did nothing, if we did absolutely nothing, Obamacare is dead. It will fail. In Tennessee, where I just left, half of the State has no insurance carrier—no carrier. It's gone. And they're going to leave the other half of the State very soon. You have that in many cases. Many States are down to one, and they'll end up with nothing.\nSo Obamacare is dead. We're going to come up with a replacement that's going to be fantastic. We have no support from the Democrats. That's why it's a little—we have to go interesting little routes. Instead of just approving it, it has to be approved in pieces, and that's working out really well. But we just got 12 very, very great people that went from \"no\" or \"maybe\"—but \"maybe\" leaning to \"no\"—right, Mike? And they all have given me a commitment that they're voting for our health plan—health care plan. So that was great.\nI want to thank you all for being here, and let's talk. And the press will leave. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-17", "title": "Remarks at a Veterans Affairs Listening Session"}

Chancellor, thank you very much. Such a great honor to get to know you, to be with you. I want to thank all of the business leaders who have joined us to discuss a subject that's very important to me: training our workforce for the 21st century, especially with respect to manufacturing jobs.\nWe're working every day to bring back jobs to our country, and thousands and thousands are already coming back. You're seeing it, you're reading about it in the papers, every single day. We want to make sure that we have the workforce development programs we need to ensure these jobs are being filled by American workers.\nGermany and the United States have incredible opportunity to deepen our partnership as we continue to develop a strong workforce in both of our countries. Both Germany and the United States are pioneering job training programs. Here in the United States, companies have created revolutionary high-tech and online courses. And of course, for decades, Germany has been a model for highly successful apprenticeship—that's a name I like, \"apprentice\"—apprenticeship programs. [Laughter] As a result, Germany's youth and unemployment rate is much lower than many of the other countries, especially the EU countries.\nI welcome collaboration between our two countries and our industry leaders. We have some of our great industry leaders here, as you know, Chancellor. Great people. We must embrace new and effective job training approaches, including online courses, high school curriculums, and private sector investment that prepare people for trade, manufacturing, technology, and other really well-paying jobs and careers. These kinds of options can be a positive alternative to a 4-year degree. So many people go to college, 4 years, they don't like it, they're not necessarily good at it, but they're good at other things, like fixing engines and building things. I see it all the time, and I've seen it; when I went to school, I saw it. I sat next to people that weren't necessarily good students, but they could take an engine apart blindfolded.\nCompanies across the country have a chance to develop vocational training programs that will meet their growing needs and to help us achieve greater prosperity. The German apprenticeship model is one of the proven programs to developing a highly skilled workforce. Germany has been amazing at this, and I'm glad that the leaders of so many companies represented today have recently launched successful programs right here in the United States. And we need that because we're training people as the jobs are pouring back in, and they are coming back in big league.\nI believe that both countries will be stronger if we continue to deepen our bilateral cooperation on vocational training as we build off the best ideas, create the greatest opportunity for growth, and improve the lives of so many workers.\nI want to thank everybody in the room. I want to thank my daughter Ivanka, who's with us today. And mostly—and most of all, I want to thank—Chancellor, I want to thank you very much. It's a great honor to have you in the White House. It's a great honor to have you in the United States. And I look forward to spending time with you. Thank you.\n[At this point, Chancellor Merkel made remarks in German, but no translation was provided.]\nPresident Trump. Okay. Maybe before the press leaves, I'd like to ask some of the folks around—the great leaders of industry and business—to introduce themselves, say a couple of words. And then, we'll get onto a little bit more private meeting, okay?\nGinni.\nIBM Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Virginia M. Rometty. Okay. I'm Ginni Rometty with IBM. And we're going to talk about two programs. One is a certification program, which, Mr. President, today we're going to announce 2,000 veterans that we're certifying in cybersecurity to be employed.\nThe President. Great.\nMs. Rometty. And then, the second is something called P-TECH, a public-private partnership. Think of it as a 6-year high school, but the graduates come out with an associate degree and with a curriculum that business will hire. And we will have a hundred schools by the end of the year. And you'll meet one of our recent graduates. In a second, Janiel Richards will introduce herself and tell you about herself, trained at the intersection of business and technology.\nPresident Trump. Great, Ginni . Thank you.\nWhite House Senior Adviser Jared C. Kushner. We've found that a lot of the private-sector companies have done a great job trying to train the workforce for the jobs that they need, the jobs of the future. In a lot of cases in America, we're finding that we don't have enough qualified applicants for the jobs that we have available, so in working with the private sector—and Ginni has been a great leader in that—the White House has been trying to get behind a lot of these programs that can help make sure we're training the American people for the jobs that we're, hopefully, going to be producing in the future.\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. Our hope is that today we really come with a way forward, some specific programs where we can interact between the educational community, the business community, and the Government. Because this is a monumental problem that needs a monumental solution.\nIBM commercial design developer Janiel Richards, student, Baruch College. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction. Good afternoon, all. Thank you for the opportunity to share my story. It is both an honor and a pleasure to be here today.\nAs mentioned, my name is Janiel Richards. In am 19 years old, and I am from East New York, Brooklyn. Enrolling in IBM's P-TECH school was the best decision for me personally and professionally. I did not fully realize the weight of the opportunity I was given; however, looking back, it was a life chance.\nP-TECH strengthened my confidence and provided me with mentors who helped me strive. I learned the importance of understanding computers and gained new skills in both coding and programming. I graduated the program in 4½ years—relatively early—and I graduated with my high school diploma and associate's degree in computer science, as well as internship experience at IBM. I learned that technology is omnipresent and opens endless doors. I am now a digital commerce design developer at IBM, where I use my skills to create website pages and checkout pages for marketplace. I'm also pursuing my bachelor's degree at Baruch College. Without the support of P-TECH and IBM, I would not be where I am today. I believe that every student should be offered this life chance.\nThank you all.\nPresident Trump. That's a great job. Thank you very much. Great job. Who wants to follow that? [Laughter] Okay.\nSiemens AG President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser. [Inaudible]—Mr. President, Chancellor, Vice President: Hi, my name is Joe Kaeser, and I work for Siemens, almost all my life. It's a company which has been in this great country for more than 160 years. We produce revenues and services worth $24 billion ever year, and 60 manufacturing sites in all 50 States in the country.\nSo, at $24 billion, America is truly versed in that aspect we brought the apprenticeship to the country, which has, in the meantime, also got certified by the Department of Labor, so we roll it out everywhere in the community. And I feel very honored today to be part of an initiative that brings not only the apprenticeship and the training for the current manufacturing into play, but also the next generation of manufacturing going forward so we maybe combine the present and the future for a great America and great manufacturing going forward.\nPresident Trump. Great job. Great company too, by the way. Great company.\nMarc.\nSalesforce Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marc R. Benioff. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, I am delighted to be here, and great to see you and the Vice President as well.\nSalesforce, as you know, is the fastest growing of the top-five software companies in the world today, and we're on a path to create 2 million jobs and add 200 GDP to the world economy through our platform. Our software, as you know, 90 percent is engineered here in the United States, and as the Vice President knows, handmade in Indianapolis and in San Francisco, where I'm from.\nAnd I'll tell you, as we have—kind of, creating these jobs all over the world, I see a great opportunity right here in the United States to create apprenticeships. And we'd love to encourage you to take a moonshot goal to create 5 million apprenticeships in the next 5 years.\nPresident Trump. That'd be great.\nMr. Benioff. And I think the key is, is that we see all these great programs and all these great companies doing workforce development. But if we all came together, if we all unified and created a great program with your leadership, I think we could create this 5 million extra jobs in the U.S.\nAnd you know, our companies are some of the greatest universities in the world. We shape these employees, we train them, we educate them, we bring them in, and I think we can do this. I think this is really exciting.\nPresident Trump. Well, congratulations, and you're going an incredible job.\nMr. Benioff. Thank you. The President. And nice to know you. And really, what you've done is just amazing. And let's do that; let's go for that 5 million. Okay? [Laughter] Very good.\nIvanka, go ahead. Say something if you want to.\nIvanka M. Trump. Thank you. And welcome, Chancellor, and to the many U.S. and German CEOs who are here today to discuss vocational education and workforce development. I applaud my father's commitment to creating millions of jobs and, specifically, making sure that all Americans have the skills required and necessary to fill the jobs both of today and of the future.\nAs many of us realize, ingenuity, creativity often comes from the determination of the private sector, so it's great to have such great private sector leaders here to share their thoughts and best practices with us today. And thank you for being here.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. Klaus.\nSchaeffler Chief Executive Officer Klaus Rosenfeld. Mr. President, Madam Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen: My name is Klaus Rosenfeld. I am the CEO of Schaeffler. Schaeffler is a global automotive and industrial supplier, with more than 14 billion U.S.-dollar sales, around 87,000 people globally, and 75 plants.\nWe manufacture bearings and other high-precision components and systems for a broad variety of applications and sectors. Our products are everything—everywhere where things turn, be it in cars, machines, airplanes, trucks, or even in washing machines. The company is family-owned, so we place great value on a culture where we think long-term and focus on quality, technology, and innovation. For us, the employee has always been critical and will always be critical.\nWe have started business in 1969 in South Carolina. Since then, the Schaeffler family has invested more than a billion in the Palmetto State. We have grown through acquisitions. We're about to finish multimillion expansions in Ohio and South Carolina.\nFor us, the U.S. is critical. We have started our first program here in the eighties—1980 in Wooster, Ohio—and since then, we have spent a lot of money in vocational dual training. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. Thank you, Klaus, very much.\nBMW AG Chairman of the Board of Management Harald Krüger. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. From my side, thank you for inviting us. Yes, it's a great pleasure for us, for me. I would like to explain why, at BMW, we call the United States of America our second home.\nI'm proud to be here because we were—nearly 25 years ago, we were founding our biggest plant in the BMW Group network in South Carolina.\nThe President. Great.\nMr. Krüger. We created 9,000 jobs, and we know that in the area around South Carolina, we have created an additional 4 to 5 to 6, 7 jobs on the 9,000 people we employ at BMW in South Carolina.\nWe have invested heavily in the further education and training and vocational training. It was round about $200 million in the last 5 years, and I can commit that we will invest another five—$200 million into training in the next 5 years. We are proud, as we are the biggest net exporter of vehicles in the United States. We have an annual net bill of $10 billion, cars exported from South Carolina. Seventy percent of our production is being exported. And I'm proud to be here, because we have one apprentice who's with us from—we have two main programs at Plant Spartanburg, a BMW Scholar Program, which was founded in 2011 and has round about 100 people in the program, and they graduate and create—get a great job at BMW. And we are very proud on their skill set; we need them for maintenance jobs.\nAnd I would like to talk about as well employment of skilled veterans, which we are setting up with our dealers in the United States that have their highly qualified veterans working for BMW dealers in the future.\nPresident Trump. Well, I've seen your plant in South Carolina. It is incredible. And congratulations; that's really great. Thank you.\nMr. Krüger. Thank you. May I invite you for the 25th anniversary in June? [Laughter]\nPresident Trump. I knew I shouldn't have said that. [Laughter] You know what, if I can, I will do it.\nMr. Krüger. Thank you very much.\nPresident Trump. I'll check it, but if I can, I'll do it. Absolutely.\nBMW employee Marie Davis. Mr. President, Madam Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen: My name is Marie Davis, and I work at Schaeffler's Automotive and Industrial Plant in Cheraw, South Carolina. Cheraw is a small town with a population of 5,800 and is nicknamed \"The Prettiest Town in Dixie.\"\nIt is a great honor for me to be here today along with my peers—apprentice Chad Robinson with Siemens Gas Turbine Plant, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Maria Puckett with BMW, from BMW Plant Spartanburg, South Carolina—and to be able to share my experiences with you regarding the Schaeffler Apprenticeship Program. BMW and Siemens also have very similar programs.\nI joined the Air Force after high school and served for 4 years. After returning home, I applied to and was accepted into the Schaeffler Apprenticeship Program. This is a very unique 3-year program of classroom and hands-on experience, completed in conjunction with Northeastern Technical College, which provided me with special skills for my career. As part of the program, I also received an associate's degree in machine tool technology and a Department of Labor certificate as a certified journeyman apprentice.\nAfter completing my apprenticeship, I worked as a CNC operator, was then promoted to—[inaudible]—leader, and am now planned maintenance supervisor. I am very glad that such an apprenticeship program existed in Cheraw, which allowed me to start and build my career with Schaeffler. I hope that more companies will follow BMW, Siemens, and Schaeffler and offer apprenticeship programs to develop skills that will allow for more manufacturing in the United States.\nIt is an incredible privilege to be invited here today. Thank you so much for listening to me.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Very nice.\nI know this one. [Laughter] Dow Chemical Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew N. Liveris. Mr. President and Madame Chancellor, what an honor it is for me to be here. I'm Andrew Liveris from Dow Chemical. I feel like Germany is our home, to match my BMW colleague's point about the U.S. being home. We have been in Germany, and in fact the Chancellor's backyard of former Eastern Germany for a long time. And the Chancellor graced us with a visit to our apprenticeship program there, which—Mr. President, the two things I want to talk about today is in fact apprenticeship, and—there's a book here that I can show which has DOW and Siemens' name on it. And just to let you know that we are working already together as two collaborators across the Atlantic to actually scale up programs like the one that was mentioned by the young lady to my right.\nSo I want to talk about that and how we can scale it up through this great leadership that you're showing. And I also want to talk about veterans and displaced workers, especially in places like Michigan, where we're based. We have community college work called Fast Start, which is taking displaced workers and reskilling them. Where new tech meets industrial tech, as Madame Chancellor says, opportunity is there. But we've got to create it by scaling right. So I want to also talk about that.\nAnd my last comment is, a big thank you for lending us or giving us Ivanka and Jared. They've been a tremendous duo in making this program real in very short weeks. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Well, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President.\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Thank you, Mr. President. And let me just express my appreciation, along with the President, for the participants in this important conversation. All the businesses that are gathered here from across the United States and across Germany are an inspiration, in the innovation that you're bringing to career and technical and vocational education and to apprenticeships.\nI'm especially impressed, Mr. President, with Janiel, and I don't know that I've seen a more inspiring debut at the Cabinet table from anyone. [Laughter]\nLet me also express my appreciation to the Chancellor for suggesting that we bring together, across the Atlantic, business leaders who have really been breaking new ground in this area, for which Germany is so celebrated. We're grateful for your leadership and look forward to sharing ideas about how we can strengthen the workforce in both of our countries.\nAnd lastly, let me just thank the President. As a former Governor from a great manufacturing State, I can tell you that one of our very first conversations was about the innovation that Indiana was bringing to career and technical and vocational education. I can assure you that the passion that you see at this table today by the President is authentic, and at his direction, we're going to work as an administration to strengthen the opportunities from secondary education on forward to open the doors for more vocational education, more technical education, and more apprenticeships across the United States to the betterment of the people of this country. And we look forward to working with our international partners to drive greater opportunities for Americans.\nSo thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much, Mike. I appreciate it.", "timestamp": "2017-03-17", "title": "Remarks at a Roundtable Discussion on Vocational Training With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and United States and German Business Leaders"}

In his remarks, the President referred to President François Hollande of France; and Andrew Napolitano, senior judicial analyst, Fox News. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization. Chancellor Merkel and reporters spoke in German, and their remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123533", "text": "President Trump. Thank you very much. Chancellor Merkel, it is a great honor to welcome you to the people's house, the White House. Our two nations share much in common, including our desire for security, prosperity, and peace.\nWe just concluded a productive meeting with the German and American companies to discuss workforce development and vocational training. Very important words. Germany has done an incredible job training the employees and future employees and employing its manufacturing and industrial workforce. It's crucial that we provide our American workers with a really great employment outlook, and that includes making sure that we harness the full potential of women in our economy.\nMy administration is in the process of rebuilding the American industrial base. A stronger America is in the interests, believe me, of the world as a whole. I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO, as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States. These nations must pay what they owe.\nDuring our meeting, I thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German Government's commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing at least 2 percent of GDP. I want to thank the Chancellor for her leadership in supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan. This has come at significant cost, including the lives of over 50 German soldiers, whose sacrifice we greatly honor.\nI also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership, along with the French President, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.\nMost importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS. I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member.\nWe also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.\nOver lunch, the Chancellor and I will talk about our economic partnership. We must work together towards fair and reciprocal trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. Millions of hard-working U.S. citizens have been left behind by international commerce, and together, we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial security.\nThe United States will respect historic institutions, and we will also recognize the right of free people to manage their own destiny.\nThe close friendship between America and Germany is built on our shared values. We cherish individual rights, we uphold the rule of law, and we seek peace among nations. Our alliance is a symbol of strength and cooperation to the world. It is the foundation of a very, very hopeful future. Thank you.\nChancellor Merkel. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and privilege to be here today in the White House, together with President Donald Trump, and have a first, personal, one-on-one meeting and an exchange of views.\nIn the period leading up to this visit, I've always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another, and I think our conversation proved this. We talked about the international situation. We talked about also apprenticeship programs when we met with CEOs and apprentices around a round table.\nAs regards the shared interests that we have, let me look back into the past. We, the Germans, owe a lot to the United States of America, particularly as regards the economic rise of Germany. This was primarily due to the help through the Marshall Plan. We were also able to regain German unity after decades of the United States standing up for this, together with other allies, and standing by our side during the period of the cold war. And we are very gratified to know that today we can live in peace and freedom as a unified country due to that.\nSo I was gratified to know that the President had aligned how important he thinks NATO is. NATO is of prime importance for us, and it was not without very good reason that we said during our summit meeting in Wales that also Germany needs to increase its expense—expenditure. We committed to this 2-percent goal until 2024. Last year we increased our defense spending by 8 percent, and we're going to work together again and again on this.\nAnd we said that, obviously, defense and security has a lot of different assets and facets to it. One the one hand, it's supporting missions in Africa, for example. It's also promoting development assistance, but it's also helping missions in Africa, for example, in trying to stand up for their own safety and security.\nWe continue to be in conversation. What was important for us today was that we were able to talk about Afghanistan, talk about, what—as the President quite rightly said, the continuing mission of Germany in Afghanistan. I am very glad that the United States are intending to continue to commit to the Afghan mission as well.\nTogether, we fight against Islamist terrorism. Germany is going to step up its work and is going to continue its work in Afghanistan and also in Syria. We're going to monitor the situation there very closely. We're going to work on political solutions in Syria, but also in Libya—what we talked about.\nI am very gratified to know that the American administration and also the President, personally, commits himself to the Minsk process. We need to come to a solution of this problem. There has to be a safe and secure solution for Ukraine, but the relationship with Russia has to be improved as well, once the situation there on the ground is clarified.\nMinsk is a good basis, but unfortunately, we haven't made yet the headway that we want to. But we are going to work together with our experts in the next few months to come on this issue.\nI am also here in my capacity as G-20 President. You know that we will be hosting the G-20 visit—the G-20 summit—sorry—this year, and I'm very pleased that the President has committed to attending this summit. We're going to talk at some length over lunch about the issues. We say this has—trade has to be rendered fairer; there has to be a win-win situation. We can talk about the details of that. We've already seen today when we had an exchange with our CEOs and also with our apprentices what sort of potential we can tap, what sort our potential our two economies have. It's very moving to see, particularly meeting with these young people, what sort of work towards the future is being done by our companies there.\nSo, particularly in this period where we are transiting from traditional manufacturing to industry—[inaudible]—capacity-building skills are so important, incidentally, not only for young people, but also for those who maybe have lost their jobs and need to be reskilled in order to find a job again. And that is an issue I know is very important for you here in the United States, but it's also important for us in Germany.\nSo I can say there are a number of issues where we will continue to cooperate very closely on the level of our experts, but also on our level. We had a very good first exchange of views, so I'm very much looking forward to the talks we will have over lunch.\nThank you.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. We'll do a couple of questions.\nMark Halperin [NBC News].\nHealth Care Reform\nQ. Mr. President, thank you. A lot of Americans now have anxiety, like 8 years ago, as the Government here debates what to do about health care. So I'm wondering if you can tell people what your bottom lines are, what's nonnegotiable. You've talked in the past about saying, no one should be denied health insurance if they can't afford it. And you've talked about——\nInterpreter. The gentleman needs to use a microphone.\nQ. [Inaudible] Are those part of your bottom line? Would you veto any piece of legislation that violated any those?\nMadame Chancellor if I could ask you, President Trump has got a different style than most recent, past U.S. Presidents. I'm wondering what you think of that style, if you think it's good for the world or if you've got any reservations about it. Thank you both.\nPresident Trump. Thank you, Mark. We just have a really wonderful group of people meeting later. We met with 12 pretty much \"noes\" in Congress—you saw that a little while ago—and they went from all \"noes\" to all \"yeses.\" And we have a lot of \"yeses\" coming in. It's all coming together. We're going to have great health care. It's going to be passed, I believe, I think substantially and pretty quickly. It's coming together beautifully. You have conservative groups; you have other groups. Everybody wants certain things. In the end, we're going to have a great health care plan.\nNow, I have to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster. It's failing. I was in Tennessee—we had a tremendous crowd the other night—and they have half of the State is uncovered. The insurance companies have left, and the other half has one insurance company, and that will probably be bailing out pretty soon also. They'll have nobody. You have many States where they have one. You have a lot of places now where they'll have none. Obamacare will fail. It will fold. It will close up very, very soon if something isn't done.\nI've often said politically, the best thing I can do is absolutely nothing. Wait 1 year and then even the Democrats will come say, please, please, you got to help us. But it's not the right thing to do for the people. We have a great plan. We have a plan that's getting more and more popular with the Republican base, with the conservative base, and with people generally. The press has covered it very inaccurately. People are truly covered well, and I think it's going to be something that's going to be a model to be looked upon.\nQ. [Inaudible]—that were nonnegotiable for you, Mr. President?\nPresident Trump. I'll tell you after we're finished. [Laughter]\nChancellor Merkel. Thank you very much. Well, I'm here as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. I represent German interests. I speak with the President of the United States, who, well, stands up for, as is right, American interests. That is our task, respectively. And I must say that I was very gratified to know the very warm and gracious hospitality with which I have been received here.\nWe held a conversation where we were trying to address also those areas where we disagree, but to try to bring people together, try to show what is our vantage point, what is the American vantage point, and then try to find a compromise which is good for both sides. Because we need to be fair with each other. Each and every one is expecting for his or her leader that something good comes out of it for their own people.\nFor Germany, I can say, well, people are different. People have different abilities, have different characteristics—traits of character, have different origins, have found their way into politics along different pathways. All that is, well, diversity, which is good. Sometimes, it's difficult to find compromises, but that's what we've been elected for. If everything just went like that and without problem, well you didn't need politicians to do these jobs.\nMs. Dunz, please.\nTrade\nQ. Kristina Dunz from the German Press Agency. Madam Chancellor, given the experience of the GDR, you are always saying that you are so confident that walls can fall also. For how dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the U.S. President is, what with the import of terrorists that he plans? And also, with the fact that he doesn't think that the EU—doesn't deal with the EU in a very respectful way?\nAnd then, Mr. President, America First, don't you think that this is going to weaken also the European Union? And why are you so scared of diversity in the news and in the media that you speak so often of fake news and that things, after all, in the end, cannot be proven? For example, the fact that you have been wiretapped by Mr. Obama?.\nPresident Trump. Should I go first? [Laughter] Nice, friendly reporter. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy, but I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy. And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years. And that's going to stop.\nBut I'm not an isolationist. I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader. And our free trade has led to a lot of bad things happening; you look at the deficits that we have, and you look at all of the accumulation of debt. We're a very powerful company—country. We're a very strong, very strong country. We'll soon be at a level that we perhaps have never been before. Our military is going to be strengthened; it's been depleted. But I am a trader. I am a fair trader. I am a trader that wants to see good for everybody, worldwide. But I am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination. So I don't know what newspaper you're reading, but I guess that would be another example of, as you say, fake news. Okay.\nChancellor Merkel. Well, allow me, if I may, to put it in the following terms. We haven't yet had time to talk at a great length about economic issues, but I would say that the success of Germany in the economic area, but also on security and peace—that the success of Germans have always been one where the German success is one side of the coin, and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration. That's something of which I'm deeply convinced. And I'm not only saying this back home, I'm saying this here. I'm saying it in the United Nations—in the United States and also here in Washington in my talks with the President.\nSecondly, I believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an open-minded way, but also in a very fair way. Freedom of movement within the European Union, for example, is a very important element of our economic progress, of peace; has been for many, many decades. The European countries for many, many centuries waged wars against each other. We have to protect our external borders because—and there we have to work on the basis of mutual interests with our neighbors.\nMigration, immigration, integration has to be worked on, obviously. Traffickers have to be stopped. But this has to be done while looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities to shape their own lives where they are; help countries who right now are not in an ability to do so, sometimes because they have civil war. I think that's the right way of going about it. And this is obviously what we have an exchange of views about, but my position is the one that I have just set out for you.\nPresident Trump. I might add that we have many plants and factories coming back into the United States. Many jobs are coming back to Michigan, to Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to a lot of places where they were losing jobs. And we will have a different policy, but it's going to be a great policy for not only the United States, but a great policy worldwide, and I look very much forward to it.\nKevin Cirilli [Bloomberg].\nHealth Care Reform/Republican Party/Trade\nQ. Yes, Mr. President, you have received—[inaudible]—health care. What exactly, sir, do you think would unify the Republican Party? And then, in terms of trade, what areas of common ground, do you think you will be able to have with the German Government?\nAnd then, for Chancellor Merkel, what do you anticipate could be a concession you would be willing to give to the administration—[inaudible]—in negotiating trade?\nPresident Trump. Well, Kevin, I think we have a very unified Republican Party. After all, we have the Presidency, we have the House, we have the Senate. And we're getting along very well, I will tell you. And if you were at the meeting that I just attended where we took 12 \"noes\" or semi-\"noes,\" no \"yeses,\" and within a short period of time, everybody was very much on board, and a commitment to vote \"yes\".\nI think we have a very unified party. I think we're actually more unified than even the election. You see—when they talk about me, I seem to be very popular, at least this week, within the party, because we have our highest numbers—the highest numbers that I've ever had in the party. So I think there's a great unification.\nNow, health care is a very, very difficult subject; it's a very complex subject. And it's a subject that goes both ways. You do something for one side, and the other side doesn't like it. But it's really something that's come together very well, and I think it's going to be very, very popular, extremely popular.\nOn trade with Germany, I think we're going to do fantastically well. Right now I would say that the negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the United States. But hopefully, we can even it out. We don't want victory; we want fairness. All I want is fairness.\nGermany has done very well in its trade deals with the United States, and I give them credit for it, but—and I can speak to many other countries. I mean, you look at China; you look at virtually any country that we do business with. It's not exactly what you call good for our workers.\nI mean, you look at the horrible NAFTA transaction; NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States. It's been a disaster for companies, and in particular, it's been a disaster for the workers. A lot of the companies just moved, but the workers are screwed. And it's probably the reason I'm standing here, maybe number one; that and maybe the military, building up our military, which we will do, and we will be stronger than ever before and, hopefully, not have to use it. But we will be stronger, and perhaps far stronger than ever before. But it's probably the reason I'm here, is when you talk about trade.\nSo I think that we are going to be a very different country. I think we're going to be—we're going to have great values. But in terms of our military, it's going to be much stronger. And our trade deals are going to be good, solid deals. Not deals that lead to closing plants and tremendous unemployment.\nOkay? Thank you. Yes, ma'am.\nChancellor Merkel. When we speak about trade agreements, then the European Union is negotiating those agreements for all of the member states of the European Union, but obviously, there's also input by the member states; they bring to the table what's important to them.\nWe have underlined as a German industry, German business community, and have made the experience that any kind of agreement that we have concluded—for example, at the very latest with South Korea—brought us more jobs, actually. People were very much concerned about losing jobs—for example, the automotive industry—but in the end, it turned out—particularly as it regards South Korea—in the end it turned out that both sides benefited.\nAnd I think it's only fair. That's the purpose of concluding agreements: that both sides win. And that is the sort of spirit, I think, in which we ought to be guided in negotiating any agreement between the United States of America and the EU. I hope that we can resume the agreement that we started. We have just now concluded our agreement with Canada, and I hope that we will come back to the table and talk about the agreement between EU and the U.S. again.\nMr. Graff, please.\nTwitter/Wiretapping Q. [Inaudible]—Graff from Die Welt. Madam Chancellor, a question addressed to you. Today we're talking about trade. The President, in the past, always said that he doesn't like multilateral trade agreements, but he does bilateral trade agreements. Do you think from the EU's point of view, T-TIP is a bilateral agreement with Washington on one side, the EU the other side? Now, is the problem maybe that America, the President of the United States, and the Europeans have a basically different understanding of what the EU is all about? That's my question addressed to you.\nAnd Mr. President, my question addressed to you, if I may——\n[At this point, the reporter asked a question in English, as follows.]\n——rejected White House claims, is that the alleged wiretapping on you, on the Trump Tower, on Trump Organization, or on members of your campaign was—that British intelligence was either responsible for it or involved in it? After these claims are rejected, what is your take on that? Are there other suspects, or do you think it was a mistake to blame British intelligence for this?\nAnd by the way, my second question, are there, from time to time, tweets that you regret in hindsight——\nPresident Trump. Very seldom.\nQ. Very seldom. And you have—so you never would have wished not to have tweeted something?\nPresident Trump. Very seldom. Probably wouldn't be here right now—but very seldom. We have a tremendous group of people that listen, and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that.\nAs far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common perhaps. [Laughter] And just to finish your question, we said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. And so you shouldn't be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox, okay?\nQ. Okay, thank you.\nChancellor Merkel. Well, I believe that the President has clearly set out his philosophy as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the American side as well. I personally don't think that Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union. We've devolved our competences to the European Union, so the European Union, or rather the Commission negotiates on behalf of the member states, so that's not going to prevent us from concluding agreements. For me, indeed, this would be then qualified as a bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States if we had it.\nBut the question is, will it be of benefit to both countries or not, and let me be very honest, very candid: A free trade agreement with the United States of America has not always been all that popular in Germany either. There have been less demonstrations against this free trade agreements in the United States than in Europe and also in Germany. So I am very glad to note that apparently the, sort of, perspective on that has changed a little bit at least in Germany, too.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.

Thanks to combined national, State, and local efforts over the course of years, Americans have reduced childhood fatalities related to accidental poisoning in the United States from 200 deaths per year to 27 per year, which is an 88 percent decline. From a public health perspective, this is a resounding achievement.\nFifty-five years ago, President John F. Kennedy noted that virtually all deaths attributable to accidental poisoning could be prevented. He was right—we as a society must do much more to prevent tragic and preventable loss of life from occurring. Ensuring the safety and security of the American people requires that we unequivocally commit to a continuation of the successful policies that have reduced accidental childhood poisonings and injuries.\nThis week we warn all Americans about unintended exposure to poisons and the threat of household items unintentionally being turned into deadly weapons. This is an important reminder—and one that could save lives.\nTo encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventative measures, on September 26, 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as, \"National Poison Prevention Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

(Applause.)\nIt's as true today as it was 17 years ago when I took your place representing the good people of Indiana's Second District, and I'm really honored to call you a friend. Thank you so much.\nTo David, to Chairman Jackson Stephens, to Senator Shelby, Senator Toomey, Senator Lee, Congressman Amash, Congressman Biggs, Congressman Blum, Congressman DeSantis, Meadows, Labrador, distinguished guests, it is great to be back to Club for Growth. (Applause.)\nI am proud to say that in my first successful campaign for Congress in the year 2000, Club for Growth was there bringing pro-growth, conservative support to our campaign, and making it possible for us to serve in Washington DC. And let me say from my heart I will always be grateful to the men and women of Club for Growth for the support for my little family. (Applause.)\nMy years in the Congress, my years serving as the 50th governor of Indiana. And today, it is -- it's almost hard for me to express how humbled I feel among so many old friends as stand before you as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. Thank you, thank you all. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve alongside my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President sends his greetings tonight; he's actually just down the road at Mar-A-Lago, the Winter White House as it's come to be known.\nBut he asked me to be here tonight to let you know that whatever differences he's had in the past, that Club for Growth's motto -- \"Prosperity and Opportunity through Economic Freedom\" -- will be a hallmark of the Trump administration throughout our service to the people of the United States. (Applause.)\nLet me assure you, serving alongside our President every day that we all believe in the same things. You say prosperity and opportunity. He says: \"Make America Great Again.\"\nWith your help and with your support, and with the support of men and women who have been involved with the Club for Growth since its early days, its help for people like me and others, I know we will do just that and lead a renewal and revival for this country as never before. (Applause.)\nYou know, I've been in the trenches with most of you in this room for years, so believe me when I say: This is the moment that we have worked so hard for and worked so long to see.\nFor the first time in a decade, thanks to your hard work, we have a pro-growth House, we have a pro-growth Senate, and we have a pro-growth President of the United States of America. (Applause.) And President Donald Trump I believe has laid out an agenda that is renewing the American spirit in ways that we haven't seen since the days of Ronald Reagan.\nThis is our moment. This is the time. And my friends, this is our chance to prove that our answers are still the right answers for America. (Applause.)\nMore freedom. Lower taxes. Less regulation and smaller government. History will attest that when America builds on this foundation, we reach heights that once seemed unreachable.\nAnd that is the foundation of this administration. President Trump's vision is to unleash growth in America like never before, and the good news is: It's already happening.\nOn Day One, President Trump went straight to work rolling back the reams of red tape. He instructed every bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before imposing any new red tape on the American people and on American free enterprise. (Applause.)\nHe's already taken action to put the Keystone and Dakota pipelines on the path to approval, creating tens of thousands of American jobs and protecting our American energy future. (Applause.)\nAnd just this past Monday, President Trump set into motion a plan to reorganize the executive branch -- and that includes identifying and eliminating federal agencies that, frankly, we just plain don't need anymore.\nIt's leadership like that -- you can applaud that if you like. (Applause.) It's leadership like this that's getting government out of the way of the American people and of American job creators.\nBusinesses are already reacting to President Trump's vision and his renewed optimism and investment. And they're investing in America in ways that are lifting and creating jobs.\nLast month alone the economy added 235,000 jobs. Construction and manufacturing are booming once again. Business leaders and American consumers haven't been this confident in years -- and by some measures, in more than a decade.\nFolks, the era of slow growth is over; a new era of American growth has begun. (Applause.)\nYou know and I know that economic growth begins with fiscal responsibility. I see my friend Senator Pat Toomey over there. We fought together in the House, shoulder to shoulder for fiscal restraint. And I know how enthusiastic he and the other great conservatives like Senator Mike Lee and others in the room are that just two days ago, President Donald Trump released the most conservative budget since Ronald Reagan sat in the Oval Office. (Applause.)\nOur vision is simple. We want a government that will keep Americans safe and that leaves us free to do what the American people do best. That's why our budget first and foremost gives our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources they need to complete their mission, protect our families, and come home safe to theirs. We're rebuilding the American military under this Trump budget. (Applause.)\nBut also at the President's direction, our budget offsets $54 billion in military spending with government spending cuts --a 31 percent cut at the E.P.A. (Applause.) Double-digit reductions in no fewer than 10 federal departments. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, The Washington Post actually ran a headline this week saying, they quote, \"historic contraction of the federal workforce.\" (Laughter.) They meant it as a warning, we took it as a compliment. (Applause.)\nWe're going to end the waste, the fraud, the abuse in D.C and make sure that the American taxpayer gets the best bang for their buck. I got to tell you this businessman who has become President of the United States believes in sharpened pencils. And he's been sharpening his pencils ever since the morning after Election Day.\nBut beyond the budget, we're going to keep slashing all the job-killing regulations and rein in unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. I want to commend the members of Congress for sending those congressional review act bills. We're going to keep rolling back regulation every chance we get so that this economy can't be crippled by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. sitting behind the comfort of their metal desks. (Applause.)\nWe've heard from businesses large and small, all across America that red tape is strangling their ability to create jobs, and to grow and thrive. That's why we're working to get government off their back.\nWe're going to keep working with the Congress to repeal the last-minute mandates rushed through by the last administration. And, frankly, we're taking a hard look at every regulation on the books -- including, as President Trump said on Wednesday, the CAFE rule that is holding back the American automotive industry will now no longer stand in the way of economic prosperity and growth. (Applause.)\nWe're making sure federal agencies fast-track projects and permits and don't slow-walk them. And we're going to roll back Dodd-Frank so that American businesses have access to the best financial system in the world. (Applause.)\nAnd with this Cabinet -- and how about this Cabinet? (Applause.) With this Cabinet, President Trump has picked men and women who know that bureaucrats don't create jobs, businesses do.\nThe bottom line is that our agenda of more freedom and less regulation is going to usher in growth and opportunity and prosperity in this country like never before. And it's the vision that the Club for Growth has been about advancing since the very beginning of this organization.\nIf you still have any doubt, there's also something else I want you to know. We're going to have the biggest tax reform and reduction in a generation in America before this year is out. (Applause.)\nUnder President Trump's leadership, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. It's going to be pro-growth, pro-savings, and pro-hardworking Americans keeping more of their hard-earned dollar.\nWe're going to simplify the tax code working with members of the House and Senate who are gathered here, and we're going to have lower rates across the board.\nWe're going to make American businesses competitive again by slashing one of the highest corporate rates in the developed world and letting American companies bring the money back from overseas so they can invest in American and create American jobs with a lower business rate. (Applause.)\nAnd not only that, and I promise to you working with members of Congress, we're going to repeal hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes when we repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nMy friends, the Obamacare nightmare is about to end. Now, I don't have to remind people here at the Club for Growth why this failed law has to go. You all have seen the headlines, and you know the facts. You've lived them in many places all over the country -- skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, mandates, higher taxes. The truth is the American people can't afford Obamacare, and it's time we no longer ask them to put up with it. (Applause.)\nIn his joint address to Congress two weeks ago, the President outlined his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all. And we're working with members of Congress to advance that plan.\nMake no mistake about it: Our plan is pro-growth and pro-freedom. It ends Obamacare's individual and employer mandates by eliminating their penalties by the time the whole plan is unfurled. It repeals the taxes I just mentioned right out of the gate. It expands health savings accounts. It enacts the biggest reform in Medicaid since the creation of that program in 1965.\nThese are the kind of solutions that conservatives like us have been talking about for years. And they're now within our reach. And let me be blunt: We need your help to get this plan passed. The House is set to vote next week on the beginning of this process. It's called the American Health Care Act, and it is a crucial step towards fulfilling our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with something that actually works.\nNow I know that there have been concerns expressed with the bill as it currently stands. And just know that the President and I are and our entire administration are listening. We're working with members of Congress to improve the bill and to make this bill even better than it already is..\nAnd we're working with every single member of Congress -- the Republican Study Committee, the Freedom Caucus, the Senate Steering Committee, and all the lawmakers here tonight, just to name a few. Thanks to their input, we've actually added a number of great amendments just in the last 24 hours.\nBeginning with, we're going to stop more states from expanding Medicaid by ceasing the expansion for states that did not expand Medicaid under Obamacare immediately. (Applause.)\nBecause of the voices of conservatives in Congress, we're going to be amending the Ho bill to give states the option for a Medicaid in a block grant in its entirety so states can reform Medicaid in the way that they see fit. (Applause.)\nAnd thanks to the leadership and the collaboration of many of the great conservatives in this room, we're going to have an amendment to allow states to include a work requirement for able-bodied adults on Medicaid so we can ensure the program is there for people who actually need it. (Applause.)\nFolks, I meant it when I said we're listening. And the President is going to continue to engage members of Congress in ways that we can improve this legislation. We had a meeting just yesterday in the Oval Office, and I was pleased that the leadership of the Republican Study Committee endorsed the bill that's moving through the House, and we're grateful for their support.\nAnd while we're having a vigorous debate, the good news is that Republicans are in complete agreement, and we have complete consensus that Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nWe'll continue to advance the President's agenda, and how we work that out is going to be the result of the legislative process and administrative action. But President Trump's vision is very simple: a national health-care marketplace and state-based Medicaid reform; allowing the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and allowing states the freedom and flexibility to redesign Medicaid around the unique needs of their own people is a pathway toward a more prosperous future and better healthcare for the American people. (Applause.)\nAnd it's important to remember that our healthcare plan doesn't begin and end with the bill that's moving through the Congress today. I wanted to make it clear to all of you this is only one part of the President's three-part strategy. The other two tracks are just as important in restoring free-market principles to American health care.\nAt this very moment, our administration is evaluating every possible administrative action to get government out of the way and allow for state-based innovation and reform.\nThe name of the game is to seize the opportunity to change the regulations, and we've got a great team with Dr. Tom Price and Seema Verma heading up HHS and the Center for Medicaid & Medicare Services to do it.\nJust this past week, they both sent a letter to every single one of America's governors saying, \"a new era for federal and state Medicaid partnership\" has begun -- and so it has. (Applause.)\nUnder Dr. Tom Price's leadership with Seema Verma at his side running Medicaid, we're going to give our states the freedom and flexibility they need with Medicaid to implement the kind of reforms that will do the most good for the most vulnerable -- state-based solutions, not one-size-fits-all federal solutions. And remember that truthfully it is about improving Medicaide.\nWhen I was governor of the great state of Indiana, we brought about transformational change in Medicaid. For the first time in the history of Medicaid, we actually gained the approval to have people have to make a monthly contribution to a health savings account to receive full benefits. And tens of thousands of Hoosiers benefitted by that. We saw people already when I was governor moving from emergency room care to primary care, people taking advantage of preventive medicine.\nMen and women I say from my heart as a former governor, now as your Vice President, the President's vision for state-based flexibility and reform is about improving the healthcare and improving the lives of our most vulnerable because states know how to do it in ways that will benefit their citizens. (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to continue to partner with the Congress to pass other important healthcare reforms, including we're going to pass medical malpractice reform at last. (Applause.) We're going to allow businesses around America to participate in association health plans, and as I mentioned before, we're going to give Americans the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines -- an idea whose time has come.\nNot before too long I expect we're going to see that little lizard and Flo on television selling health insurance just the way they sell car insurance and sell life insurance. (Laughter and applause.)\nOur three-part strategy, once enacted, we truly believe will create a dynamic national health-insurance marketplace, which is the key to making affordable, high-quality coverage accessible for every American.\nNow we can't lose sight of what's at stake in the coming weeks. This is a momentous time. We literally have an opportunity to begin to accomplish what everyone in this room has fought so hard to achieve for so long. And President Trump and I look forward to continuing to work with all of you -- the men and women in public life who are here, and those of you who are patrons and supporters that are present.\nAnd know this: When we repeal and replace Obamacare, we will also make room for even more tax relief for working families, small businesses, and family farms when we take up tax reform this spring. (Applause.)\nBut health care isn't the only place where we need your partnership. The same goes for the rest of our pro-growth, pro-freedom agenda.\nQuite frankly, we're counting on you. And we know you'll be there. You've already demonstrated -- many of you for many years here at Club for Growth -- your dedication to the principles that we all share.\nI look around this room and I see true patriots -- men and women who love this country and have been willing to devote your time and your talent and your treasure to the country's future without any regard to whether you'd ever be acknowledged or ever get credit for it. Those great candidates that you've supported over the years, and that now people the hallways of the House and the Senate serving the American people. The debt this country owes to the men and women in this organization and throughout the conservative movement can only be repaid by keeping faith with the ideals and the principles that you have sought to advance.\nYou believe what I believe, you know what I know. This is an extraordinary country, that despite all the unparalleled achievements in our nation's history, we have only just begun. And President Trump believes we can and that we will astound the world with our freedom, with our strength and our prosperity because the best days for America are yet to come. (Applause.)\nI truly do count myself blessed to stand shoulder to shoulder with my friend, the 45th President of the United States and to have stood for so long in this cause with so many of you in this room.\nYou know, we've been on this journey together for a long time. As David mentioned, when I ran for Congress, he was nice enough to mention that I'd lost the first two times. (Laughter.) And then the Club for Growth helped me. The Club for Growth was there, supporting me and my little family in our desire to serve our country. We stood together then, and we've stood together ever since.\nThe reason that we're here with a pro-growth President and a pro-growth Congress on the cusp of repealing the failed policies of Obamacare is because, on the cusp of transformational tax reform, on the cusp of a whole range of reforms that will enliven this country's economy and open doors of opportunities for millions of Americans is that year after year, all of you in this room and conservatives around America never gave up. And I'm just here to say thanks, and to tell you to press on.\nMy friends, this is our moment. Now is the time. This is our rendezvous with destiny. And I know we'll meet the challenge. It will come together. We'll give all of our energy, our enthusiasm, our courage, and our conviction, our passion, and our prayers. And in that, I'm confident -- I'm confident we'll make the most of the opportunity before us. And under President Trump's leadership, I know we'll get this economy moving again. Under his leadership, I know we'll restore opportunity and prosperity for all our people. We'll make the best healthcare system in the world even better with free-market principles, more jobs, higher incomes, better healthcare in a safer and more prosperous America.\nIn a word, my friends, with your help, and with God's help, we'll make America great again.\nThank you very much. Thanks for having me back and God bless you and God bless the United State of America.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123579", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Florida! I want to thank your governor for that kind introduction. He's been a friend for many years. And, ladies and gentleman, how about that governor, Rick Scott? (Applause.)\nFlorida is incredibly fortunate to have a leader like Rick Scott. Since he took office, he's signed over 50 tax cuts, he balanced the budget year after year, and he helped create more than 1.3 million jobs -- one of the fastest-growing state economies in America. (Applause.) The sun is definitely shining on Florida State with Governor Rick Scott. Give him another round of applause, would you please? (Applause.)\nGovernor, I have to tell you, President Trump and I are proud -- proud to partner with you to make America great again. (Applause.) The same goes with all the other dedicated public servants who are here with us today. And I'm honored to be in their presence. Congressman John Rutherford, Mayor Lenny Curry -- thank you for joining us.\nAnd, Seema Verma, it is such a privilege to have you here. Folks, I had the honor of swearing her in this past Tuesday as the 15th Administrator of America's Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. She happens to be a Hoosier, and she's one of the leading healthcare experts in the country, and she's going to do an incredible job for people all across this country. (Applause.) Thank all these public servants. (Applause.) I can say with confidence Seema Verma is going to help us make American healthcare great again. And I want to thank you so much for your service, Seema. More than I can tell you, I'm incredibly proud.\nNow, it is a great privilege to be with all of you today, back in this great Sunshine State. Last fall, thanks to all of you -- thanks to your hard work, your support, and your prayers -- the people of Florida voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America. (Applause.) Florida made a difference. And the President asked me to stop by just to give his personal thanks to each and every one of you. Hardworking Americans like all of you were our biggest supporters.\nAnd on behalf of the President and his family, and on behalf of my little family: Thank you, Florida. Your votes have set us on a path to make America great again. And we're here to say thanks. (Applause.)\nIt was quite a campaign, wasn't it? And it's already been quite an administration. (Laughter.) It's the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. He's my friend. He's a man who loves his family, he loves this country -- boundless energy and optimism, broad shoulders and a big heart. And thanks I want to express on his behalf, as well.\nTo all the great business owners who are with us today, we enjoyed a great conversation today about the issue that I'll talk more about in just a moment. And join me in thanking these great job-creators in Jacksonville. Thank you for sharing your candid feedback about what we can do to help you grow jobs right here in Jacksonville. Give them all a word of thanks. (Applause.)\nLast but not least, I want to thank Mac McGehee and the whole Mac Paper team for hosting us here today. Mac, your family now for three generations have been a pillar in the Jacksonville community for over 50 years, and today you have over 600 employees spread across nine states. You only get that way when you're doing something right and you're doing it for a long time. The President and I thank you for all that you do. And let's give the whole Mac Paper team a big round of applause for their great, great success and the jobs they've created here. (Applause.) Thank you.\nAnd let me assure you, let me assure all the job-creators, all the people that work for businesses large and small: President Trump, I can assure you -- President Trump is going to be the best friend American small business will ever have. (Applause.)\nYou know, I grew up in a small business -- a small business family -- actually in a small town in southern Indiana. It was a gas station business. I was a -- I started working as a gas station attendant in one of my father's gas stations when I was only 14 years of age. And for you young people in the room, we'll explain later what a gas station attendant actually used to do. (Laughter.) As the whole world knows, the President also grew up in a family business, too.\nWe actually both know, because of our life experiences in our families, we know the sacrifices that are required to make a business work. And more importantly, we know that when small business is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And President Trump is going to fight for small business America, just as he's done from day one.\nWe want to create jobs and prosperity and growth in America like never before. And small business is going to be the lion's share of that. Just look at what the President has already done.\nOn day one, President Trump went straight to work rolling back reams of red tape. He's instructed literally every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new federal red tape on job-creators in America. (Applause.)\nHe's taken decisive action already to protect American jobs and American workers by ending illegal immigration once and for all. (Applause.)\nHe also took action recently when he authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines that will create thousands of jobs and protect America's energy future. (Applause.)\nAnd businesses are already responding to President Trump's \"Buy American, Hire American\" vision with optimism and investment. From coast to coast -- Governor Scott will back me up on this -- companies are announcing that they're keeping jobs here, they're creating new jobs -- tens of thousands of them. Just last month, the American economy added 235,000 new jobs, and we are just getting started. (Applause.)\nUnder President Trump's leadership and working with great congressmen like your congressman, John Rutherford, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We're going to keep slashing through red tape, we're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nAnd because you hired a builder to be President of the United States, we're going to rebuild this country so that Florida and every other state has the resources to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, the best airports, and the best future we could ever imagine, with the infrastructure that we need. (Applause.)\nBut making America great again doesn't just mean our economy. President Trump has no higher priority, I can assure you, than the safety and security of the American people. Over the past year, the American people watched in horror as terror struck Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale. Our support and our prayers have been with you ever since. And so, for that matter, I can assure you, is our resolve.\nRest assured, President Trump will continue to take steps every single day to protect our nation, protect our way of life, and protect and prevent attacks by radical Islamic terrorism in this country again. (Applause.)\nYour former sheriff knows in his heart what people also know: President Donald Trump is standing with the men and women who serve in law enforcement in this country as never before. (Applause.)\nSome of you are sitting, a lot of you are standing, but would you all mind getting on your feet and thanking all the men and women in law enforcement who are here with us today? (Applause.) I promise you, under President Trump's leadership, we're going to make sure that the men and women who serve in law enforcement have the resources and the training and the tools that they need to protect our families and go home safe to theirs.\nThe President has also taken steps to secure our nation, to secure our borders -- which means building a wall, enforcing our laws, beginning with ensuring, as the President said before Congress, that gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities are off the streets of Florida and out of this country. (Applause.)\nAnd while we talk about security, this last Thursday President Trump unveiled his budget. It's a budget that, at its very heart, will end the era of budget cuts for our armed forces. We will rebuild our military. We will restore the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) We will give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. That I promise you. (Applause.)\nAnd, lastly, by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch, who will go before the Congress this coming week, President Trump has kept his word to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court of the United States who will keep faith with the Constitution and uphold the God-given liberties that have been enshrined there for now more than two centuries. (Applause.)\nSo we've been busy. We've been busy. My friends, President Trump is a man of his word, and he's a man of action. And I believe he will make America great again. And make no mistake, about it: The Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.)\nIt's amazing -- really amazing to think about it. Virtually every promise they made about Obamacare, when it was passed into law, has been broken. We all remember what they were. Remember? They told us the cost of health insurance would go down. Not true. They told us if you liked your doctors, you could keep them. Not true. They told us if you liked your health plan, you could keep it. Not true.\nJust the other day, I joined President Trump to listen to hardworking Americans who have suffered from these broken promises. They told us in visceral and in emotional terms the stories that I heard from business leaders today: skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer choices, higher taxes. They told us, just like these employers did today, about the hard choices that they've had to make, about how Obamacare is standing in the way of not only their companies' aspirations, but the hopes and dreams of the people that work there and desire to work there. It was a heartbreaking conversation, then and now. And they're not alone.\nThink about it: Just last year, premiums, following Obamacare, spiked by 25 percent on average across America. Millions have lost their plans. In one-third of the nation's counties, Americans only have one insurance company to choose from -- which essentially means they have no choice at all. Given all the failings, it's no wonder that 400,000 fewer people enrolled in Obamacare this year.\nNow, your governor, I can tell you, has been remarkable on this. He mentioned just a few moments ago -- we actually met when, as a private citizen, Rick Scott was fighting against Obamacare before it ever became law. (Applause.) And, Rick, let me thank you for that, and thank you for your ongoing leadership.\nAs Governor Rick Scott said recently -- and he knew this from the fight we fought then and the fight you fought every day since -- that Obamacare was, in his words, \"sold on a lie.\" And then, in his typical plain-spoken way, Governor Scott said, it just plain \"doesn't work.\" And he was right.\nFlorida is actually a textbook example of everything that's wrong with Obamacare. Here in the Sunshine State, Obamacare premiums rose by 19 percent last year -- with some increasing by nearly 40 percent. Over 400,000 Floridians were scheduled to lose their plans at the start of this year. And nearly three-quarters -- 75 percent -- of the state has no choice at all when it comes to health insurance.\nThe truth is, Florida can't afford Obamacare anymore. And job-creators in Florida can't afford it either. (Applause.) I heard it. I heard it earlier today. The small businesses represented here, they told me that Obamacare hits them with mandates, with regulations, with higher taxes and higher costs.\nMac Paper is actually a great case in point. Since Obamacare went into effect, Mac was telling me that they've been forced to spend more than $300,000 not on jobs, not on investments that will create more jobs, but on just trying to comply with this failed law.\nThat's just not right. That money would have been better invested in your workers, Mac. And I know that's where you would have liked to invest it -- in payroll and in benefits, in your future, instead of being wasted on the failed policies of Obamacare.\nMen and women, this can't continue. Every day that Obamacare survives is another day the American people and American businesses are struggling. Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nSince the day Florida helped send President Trump to the White House, I can promise you he has been focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare with something that actually works.\n? We know that the core flaw of Obamacare was this notion that you could order every American to buy health insurance whether they wanted it or needed it or not. That was never the answer.\nJust a few days ago in Nashville, President Trump actually called that Obamacare's \"fatal flaw.\" The President couldn't be more right. That's why we're going to end this flaw. We're going to replace it with real solutions built on freedom, personal responsibility, and state flexibility and reform. That's what works, and that's what President Trump's plan for healthcare reform will do for the American people. (Applause.)\nWe're going to begin, though, by repealing Obamacare's taxes. We're going to end its mandates by eliminating the penalties. We're going to give Americans more choices. We're going to expand health savings accounts for every American. We're going to give Americans a tax credit that'll help them buy the coverage they need at a price they can afford. And we're also going to do it with what the President likes to call \"big heart.\" We're going to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions still have access to the coverage that they need. And to you fellow parents out there with kids under the age of 26 -- I have three -- (laughter) -- we'll make sure you can keep your kids on your insurance until they're 26 years of age. (Applause.)\nNow, folks, what I just laid out is only a small glimpse of everything our plan will do. The bill moving through the Congress, the American Health Care Act, is an important step in the right direction. We're working around the clock with Congressman Rutherford and other members of the Republican majority in the House and the Senate; and with leaders here in Florida to make this bill even better.\nPresident Trump laid out a few key elements just yesterday with members of Congress in the Oval Office, and we're going to continue to work with members of Congress to improve this bill. It's what the legislative process is all about.\nAnd we're not going to -- we're going to do a couple of different things with a few recent amendments that are worth mentioning and are owing in part to the engagement that we had with Congress.\nFirst off, we're going to stop any more states from expanding Medicaid and adding a burden to future generations. We're going to give states the option of block grants of Medicaid to the states so states like Florida can innovate and design Medicaid around the unique needs of the people in this community.\nAnd we're going to allow states like Florida to include a work requirement for able-bodied adults ensuring that Medicaid's benefits are available for those who need it the most. (Applause.)\nThese are all common-sense solutions added to this legislation in a vigorous debate on Capitol Hill, and under the President's leadership, we'll continue to listen intently for ways to make this even better.\nJust yesterday, President Trump made it clear he supports the bill 100 percent, and we all do. Every day, more and more members of Congress are getting on board. And as we work to pass this first bill, rest assured our administration is also working with Dr. Tom Price over at Health and Human Services and with Seema Verma at the Center for Medicaid Services to give states like Florida the freedom and flexibility to help your most vulnerable in the ways that are going to be best for you.\nJust this past week, they sent a letter to Governor Scott and other state leaders around the country saying that \"a new era for the federal and state Medicaid partnership\" has begun -- and so it is. (Applause.)\n? The fact is, and I say this as a governor of the state of Indiana, that the fact is Florida is a unique state with unique needs -- and this administration knows that state-based solutions, designed by your governor, your state legislature are the best way to give better coverage, and get better healthcare outcomes, particularly for the most vulnerable citizens across the state of Florida.\nAnd under President Trump's leadership lastly just know this, we're going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines -- the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. (Applause.)\nThat's the combination. President Trump and I know that the way to lower costs is to increase choices to create a dynamic national marketplace, and that's what our plan will do. Probably won't be too long before you see Flo and some little lizard on television -- (laughter) -- selling health insurance. And that's the American way.\nAnd let me say a couple of things to you before I slip off and get on that plane and head back south with your governor. I want to assure the people of Florida: We're going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America that makes affordable, high-quality health insurance accessible for every American. (Applause.)\nBut be assured about this, be clear on this, though, folks, this is going to be a battle in Washington, D.C. All right? Obamacare's defenders are working hard, so we have to work harder. And we're counting on Florida. We need every Republican in Florida to support this bill and support the President's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's why we voted.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And President Trump and I -- President Trump and I are confident -- we're confident that with your support, Florida will be there, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all. (Applause.)\n? It really is remarkable this time we find ourselves in, a time of renewed hope and boundless opportunity for the American people. I think we're at a pivotal moment in our nation's history that started last November the 8th.\nIn this moment, though, I want to leave you with a challenge, we need every freedom-loving American who knew we could be stronger, who knew we could be better, who knew we could stand tall again to yourselves stand up and speak out. It's time that we demanded government as good as our people. We need you to tell the world that we can do better, that we're renewing and restoring this country, that we're putting it back on a path to a brighter future. Tell your neighbors and your friends. Stop people outside the drug store. Just let them know how strongly you support the President's vision for this country, particularly when it comes to healthcare.\nOne of my favorite verses in the Old Book is from the Book of Jeremiah. It's hung over the mantle of our home since I first ran for Congress successfully in the year 2000, and now it hangs over the mantle in the Vice President's Residence in Washington, D.C.\nIt simply reads: \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.\"\nIn November, I believe with all of my heart that the people of Florida and the people of this country voted to give America a President with the strength, the courage, and the vision, to make America safe again. You voted to give us a new leader who will make America prosperous again. And I know in my heart with your continued faith and support, together we will make America great again.\nThank you very much. Thank you for being here. God bless you and God bless America.

Jackson was an American hero: first, as a brilliant general whose crushing defeat of the British at New Orleans saved our independence in the War of 1812; and later, as the seventh President of the United States, when he fought to defend the forgotten men and women from the arrogant elite of his day. Does it sound familiar? The memory of his leadership lives on in our people, and his spirit points us to a better future.\nThis week, I also traveled to the Willow Run plant in Michigan. At that facility during the Second World War, the Ford Motor Company built not cars, but entire airplanes. At one point, workers there produced a complete B-24 Liberator every single hour. Hard to believe.\nToday, on that site, is a new facility, where the cutting edge cars of the future will be tested. And this week, the old plant was filled once again with thousands of workers and engineers. I was there to share the good news for the American auto industry.\nWe announced we'll be reversing an 11th-hour executive action from the previous administration that was threatening thousands of auto jobs in Michigan and across America. And I mean threatening; it was very, very sad to see.\nIn fact, we are setting up a Task Force in every Federal agency to identify any unnecessary regulation that is hurting American businesses and American jobs. The first two job reports of my administration show that we've already added nearly half a million new jobs.\nThe days of economic surrender for the United States are over. For too long, special interests have made money shipping jobs overseas. We need a new economic model; let's call it the American Model. Under this model, we will lower the burden on American business, but in exchange, they must hire and grow America and American jobs. This will be a win-win for our companies and for our workers.\nLet's buy American and hire American. Let's create jobs in America. Let's imagine new industries. And let's build a beautiful future together.\nAmong the workers building B-24 bombers at the Willow Run plant during World War II was one tough lady. You might have heard her: They called her Rosie the Riveter. And when Rosie's country called her, she answered the call. Rosie was famous for her toughness and her strength and for the words that were emblazoned above her famous image. It said very simply: \"We can do it.\"\nIf Americans unite and find again within our Nation the soul of Rosie and the spirit of Jackson, I have no doubt that we can do it and do it like never before.\nThank you. Enjoy your week.", "timestamp": "2017-03-18", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Trump welcomed Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to the Oval Office to reaffirm America's support for Iraq and the Iraqi people in our shared fight against the terrorist group ISIS/Da'esh. The United States and Iraq stand fully committed to a comprehensive partnership, rooted in mutual respect and grounded in the United States-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement, which provides a framework for political, economic, cultural, and security cooperation. President Trump was particularly honored that Prime Minister al-Abadi was one of the first foreign leaders he has hosted at the White House, a testament to the close bonds between the American and Iraqi people and the importance of the relationship between our governments.\nIn today's meeting, President Trump and Prime Minister al-Abadi praised the unprecedented cooperation between the militaries of the United States and Iraq in the fight against ISIS/Da'esh, including the campaign to liberate west Mosul. Although ISIS/Da'esh remains a dangerous enemy, we are confident it will be defeated. As Iraqi forces consolidate gains against ISIS/Da'esh, the two leaders agreed that the United States and Iraq will pursue a long-term partnership to decisively root out terrorism from Iraq and strengthen the Iraqi military and other key institutions. Together with our partners in the 68-member Global Coalition against ISIS/Da'esh, the United States will continue training and support for Iraqi forces to bring about the terrorist group's decisive and enduring defeat and further build the capabilities of Iraqi forces. This security partnership is a vital component of the national security of both the United States and Iraq.\nRecognizing that terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone, the two leaders also agreed to promote a broad-based political and economic partnership based in the Strategic Framework Agreement. In the months ahead, United States and Iraqi leaders will consult on steps to deepen commercial ties and promote investment, expand collaboration in the energy sector, and seek new opportunities for cultural and educational cooperation. As we seek to advance common interests and promote prosperity, the United States commends Prime Minister al-Abadi's vision for building a prosperous and diversified economy in Iraq, capable of fulfilling the needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people. The United States strongly supports Iraq's partnership with the International Monetary Fund and, in concert with our G-7 partners, will continue to help Iraq stabilize Iraq's economy and achieve needed reforms. The United States also welcomes the Prime Minister's efforts to foster more inclusive and accountable governance in Iraq and to address the human suffering in the country created by the brutality of ISIS/Da'esh.\nPresident Trump and Prime Minister al-Abadi agreed that it is essential that Iraq develop and maintain positive relations with regional partners, both to enhance stability in the Middle East and to help Iraq begin to rebuild from the ravages of the brutal occupation of ISIS/Da'esh. The President commended Prime Minister al-Abadi on Iraq's efforts to foster more constructive ties with countries in the region, which have a vital role in helping Iraq become a force for stability in the Middle East. As the United States and Iraq stand together against terrorism in all its forms, we will not tolerate efforts by any country to destabilize Iraq or undermine Iraq's democratic institutions.\nThe United States and Iraq remain unified in our commitment to a comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership in the years ahead.", "timestamp": "2017-03-20", "title": "Press Release - Joint Readout of Meeting Between President Donald J.

I am thrilled to be here in the great state of Kentucky and the beautiful city of Louisville! (Applause.) And this place is packed. (Applause.) There are a lot of people outside that aren't getting in, but that's all right. We love them, too, right? We love them, too. (Applause.)\nWe're in the heartland of America, and there is no place I would rather be than here with you, tonight. (Applause.) Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, was born right here in Kentucky. (Applause.) That's not bad. The legendary pioneer, Daniel Boone, helped settle the Kentucky frontier. (Applause.) And the great 19th century American statesman, Henry Clay, represented Kentucky in the United States Congress. (Applause.) Henry Clay believed in what he called the American system, and proposed tariffs to protect American industry and finance American infrastructure.\nI'm honored to be here today with many of your tremendous modern-day leaders. We're joined tonight -- and I want you to give him a nice hand, because he's on our side -- got to take care of our people, right? (Applause.) And he's got a lot of power for the people of Kentucky. Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell -- where is he? (Applause.) Come here, Mitch. Thank you, Mitch. How you doing, Mitch? Hey, Mitch, are we going to be okay? Everything good? That healthcare is looking good? Good. Thanks, Mitch.\nAnd we're also very lucky to have in my Cabinet our Secretary of Transportation, the wonderful Elaine Chao. (Applause.) Working with Secretary Chao, we're going to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of the United States. It's time, right? It's time. (Applause.) It is time. After spending trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, it is indeed time. We are going to start taking care of our country. (Applause.)\nAlso with us this evening is your great Governor, Matt Bevin. (Applause.) Where's Matt? Matt. Thanks, Matt. Congressman Andy Barr. (Applause.) And Congressman Jamie [James] Comer. (Applause.) The state motto of Kentucky is: United we stand, divided we fall. We are united. (Applause.)\nSomebody from the fake media the other day asked me a question.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: They said, how are the Republicans going to finally get together? I said, wait a minute, we won the presidency, we won the House, we won the Senate. (Applause.) I mean, what? (Applause.) Actually, he was a nice guy that asked the question, but I was sort of thinking, that was an interesting question. Because we've just about never been on a streak like this. I think 1928? That's a long time ago. And we're going to get a lot of things done. And then we're going to get to truly one of my favorite things: It's called reducing taxes. (Applause.)\nStanding together as Americans, we are going to deliver amazing things for the citizens of Kentucky and the United States. Most importantly, we are going to take power back from the political class in Washington, and return that power to you, the American people. It's happening. It's happening. It's happening. (Applause.) It started on November 8th. Remember that beautiful, beautiful day? That beautiful day. We're going to give it back. (Applause.) That was a beautiful day.\nThey weren't giving us a lot of chance, were they? Remember? \"There is no path to 270.\" (Applause.) Remember the line? And you know, for the Republicans, the Electoral College was very, very hard, very hard to win. Do you remember the famous line, \"There is no path to 270.\" Well, there was a path to 306, but maybe not to 270. (Applause.)\nBut we've got a lot of work to do. The fact is, we inherited a mess. It's a mess. I met with the Prime Minister today of Iraq. I met with others -- the Middle East, North Korea.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: North Korea. I'll tell you what, what's happening there is disgraceful and not smart, not smart at all. So many different problems. And I'll tell you, you see what's happening with the economy. We've picked up $3 trillion in value, and our companies are bringing people back to work. (Applause.)\nWe have to take on every special interest that has profited from the -- and I don't mean, like, a little bit; I mean really terrible trade deals. Horrible trade deals. Last year, our country lost almost $800 billion in trade. Not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen anymore. (Applause.)\nUncontrolled immigration -- you see what's going on there; that's happening quickly. Little problem with the courts not wanting to give us the decisions that should be given -- but we're going to win it -- and a financial system stacked against the American people.\nThese entrenched interests will do anything they can to keep the broken system in place, but they will fail, and we will win. Because we are fighting on the side of our great American heritage. (Applause.) This place is packed. (Applause.) I mean, I don't want to say this -- we could have been watching a good basketball game tonight, right? What happened? What happened? That's all right. You've done a good job, right? You've a good job. Great team, great coach. It's all right.\nWe are going to drain the swamp of government corruption in Washington, D.C., and we are going to keep our promises -- all of the promises that we made. We are going to massively reduce your taxes. (Applause.) We are going to reduce very substantially rising crime, and support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.)\nWe're going to bring accountability to the VA and take great care, finally, finally, finally, of our great veterans. (Applause.) Our Secretary -- you wouldn't believe it, because I still don't have my Cabinet. They won't approve my Cabinet.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: There is a lot of division and a lot of bad stuff going on in this country. But I'll tell you, David, we love David -- David got approved 100 to nothing. Can you believe it? Head of the VA, Secretary of the VA. (Applause.) And you watch what happens with the veterans. It's time -- it's time we take care of our veterans. (Applause.)\nWe are going to rebuild the United States military, finally. (Applause.) I proposed a budget that calls for one of the largest increases in defense spending history, and we need it. We need it. Got a lot of bad actors out there, folks, right? That's time, also.\nAnd it's also jobs, because we're going to make this equipment right here in the USA. (Applause.) And we believe in three crucial words: Peace through strength. (Applause.) There's our great lieutenant governor, by the way. Please -- thank you, darling. Thank you. (Applause.)\nBut we will spend our money wisely. With just one negotiation on one set of airplanes, I saved the taxpayers of our country over $700 million. (Applause.) And that's just one of many. We've also kept our promise to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.) Judge Neil Gorsuch's hearing is now underway in the Senate, and I urge members of both parties to swiftly approve his nomination. He is an outstanding man from an outstanding family, with an unbelievably wonderful wife. They should approve.\nThere's another promise that is deeply important to me and I know it is deeply important to you: We are going to put our coal miners back to work. (Applause.) They have not been treated well, but they're going to be treated well now. Clean coal, right? Clean coal.\nI have already eliminated a devastating anti-coal regulation, and that is just the beginning. You saw that. We got a lot of thank-yous from a lot of great people that work very hard and want to keep working. A lot of people are going to be put back to work. A lot of coal miners are going back to work. As we speak, we are preparing new executive actions to save our coal industry and to save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work. The miners are coming back. (Applause.) Our new EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, a Kentucky native, will turn the EPA -- environmental -- will turn the EPA from a job-killer into a job-creator. You watch. (Applause.)\nSince my inauguration, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs. And that's, believe me, just the beginning. Just the beginning. (Applause.) And I don't know -- have you seen the consumer confidence levels, Matt? They're through the roof. I don't even know, I think you're doing as well in Kentucky, but I know you don't like Obamacare -- I know. (Laughter.) Great guy.\nWe're working to remove regulations on our auto industry so we can make more cars right here in America, including more cars in Kentucky. (Applause.) We've wiped out many, many unnecessary regulations, and that's just the beginning. It's continuing on a weekly basis. We're getting rid of unnecessary regulations. We're going to be good for business. And we're going to be good for the workers of America. (Applause.)\nWe've also cleared the way for the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines. (Applause.) And as I was signing it, I said, where are they getting the steel? Where? And I said, you know what, if people want to build pipelines in the United States, they should use American steel, and they should build it and create it right here. That pipe is going to be manufactured right here. That was like, last minute -- I'm saying, where are they buying this stuff?\nLike Henry Clay, we want to put our own people to work. We believe in two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. (Applause.) So as you folks all know, Henry Clay was the legendary Kentucky politician who became the eighth Speaker of the House in 1811. You know, they compared my campaign to Jackson -- President Jackson, right -- 1828. I said, can you imagine having to go back that far? And they said, this was even more severe. But we did a good job. Did we do a great job together? (Applause.) 1828, that's a long time ago. Oh, boy. And he was a good President, right? He was a good President.\nClay was a fierce advocate for American manufacturing. He wanted it badly. He said, very strongly: Free trade, which would throw wide open our ports to foreign production without duties, while theirs remains closed to us. That was his quote. He knew, all the way back, early 1800s. Clay said that trade must be fair, equal, and reciprocal. Boom. He said, fair, equal, and reciprocal. I'm talking about reciprocal trade. Reciprocal. (Applause.)\nI mentioned that the other day to a group in my office. We're going to be doing some trade deals as soon as we get the healthcare finished. Oh, I'm looking forward to these trade deals. They're the ones -- ooh. There's going to be no ambiguity. But I used the word \"reciprocal.\" You know, Harley Davidson makes great motorcycles. They were in my office. They were in my office. And they came in -- I said, how you doing? \"Great.\" How's business? \"Great.\" How do you overseas? \"Well, it's tough. We have some countries that charge us a $100 [sic] import tax.\" I said, 100? 100 percent. Think of it. They want $100 [sic] -- 100 percent. So I said, how do you do? \"Not so well. It's tough.\"\nThey have other countries -- they charge a lot. We want reciprocal. So if they're going to charge us 100 percent, we're going to charge them 100 percent. And you know what's going to happen? They're going to bring their 100 percent down to nothing, like we charge. We can't allow that to happen. (Applause.) We can't allow that to happen.\nIn explaining his American system, Clay argued that the sole object of the tariff is to tax the produce and -- remember, to tax the produce of foreign industry with the view of promoting American industry. For too long, our government has abandoned the American system. Since NAFTA was approved in 1994 -- the worst trade deal ever made by any country I think in the world -- America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs. Do not worry, we are starting on NAFTA very soon. You know, I've only been there for, what, 52 days, right? (Applause.) Somebody said to me, when are you starting on NAFTA? I said, wait a minute, I did this, this, this. I knocked out unbelievable numbers of regulations. We're negotiating much better deals -- these terrible deals that were made. I've been here like 51 days. Give me a chance. Oh, I look forward.\nWe're doing -- we're going to do something with NAFTA that you are going to be very, very impressed with. That's going to be an easy one, folks. That's going to be an easy one.\nSince China joined -- and it's another beauty -- the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States has lost many more than 60,000 factories. We sacrificed our own middle class to finance the growth of foreign countries. But those days, ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, are over. Is that okay? (Applause.) Those days are over. It's crazy. You know what that is? Much more than 60,000 factories. You know what that is? It's like -- I said, if you have a map, how do you put that many dots on the map, right? More than 60,000 factories. But they're all coming back. You see them coming back. You see car companies who were going to build elsewhere, and now they're saying that because of Trump we're going to build in Michigan, we're going to build in Ohio, we're going to build in Kentucky. (Applause.) They're saying it loud and clear.\nBecause from now on, it's going to be America first. America first. (Applause.) We will be, I promise you, a rich nation once again. (Applause.) And we will do what we have to do, and we will not allow other countries to take advantage of us like they've been doing to a level that's hard to believe. Hard to believe. Not going to happen. Not going to happen anymore, Kentucky, remember that -- okay? You just worry about your basketball team. I'll take care of the rest. (Laughter and applause.)\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. That is why I am following through on my promise to secure, protect, and defend the borders of the United States. (Applause.) We will build -- that's right -- a great, great border wall. (Applause.) And you know, it's already out to bid. You've probably been reading, tremendous numbers of bidders. What does that mean when you have a lot of bidders? It means we're going to get it for the right prices, okay? Believe me.\nAnd we will stop the drugs that are pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of others. We're going to stop the drugs. (Applause.) A lot of them are coming in from the southern border.\nSince the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the southern border by 61 percent. (Applause.) Sixty-one percent that we haven't started. And the courts are not making it easy, folks. They're not making it easy.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Terrible. Sixty-one percent. During the campaign, as I've traveled all across this great country, I met with many American families whose loved ones -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives -- were viciously killed by illegal immigrants. Incredible. Incredible. These amazing American lives were stolen because our government refused to enforce our already-existing laws. These American victims and their families were ignored by the media. The media doesn't want to talk about it.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: They don't want to talk about it. They were ignored by the consultants. They were ignored by Washington. But these Americans were not ignored by me, they were not ignored by you. You showed that on November 8th. They were not ignored by you, and they will never be ignored by any of us. (Applause.)\nAs we speak tonight, we are finding that drug dealers, robbers, thieves, gang members, predators, killers and criminals of all types preying on our citizens -- you've been seeing it; you've been reading about it, and you've been seeing it -- one by one, they are being tracked down and thrown the hell out of our country, and we will not let them back in. (Applause.)\nWe are also working to protect our citizens from terrorism. (Applause.) We have seen the devastation at home, from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino, and many, many other places. We've seen attacks overseas in France, in Germany, in Belgium. It's time for intelligence and common sense to be used. (Applause.)\nThe single best way to protect -- and you have to do this, you have to do this -- and to keep foreign terrorists from attacking our country is to keep these foreign terrorists from entering our country in the first place. (Applause.) And we will stop radical Islamic terrorism. We will stop it. Not going to let it happen. Not here. Not going to let it happen.\nFinally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. (Applause.) And we're going to be working very closely with our leader, Mitch McConnell, to get that job done. Paul Ryan, everybody, they're going to be working very hard. And Congressman Andy Barr, Jamie Comer -- I have to thank them for their help and their support as we move toward the crucial House vote on Thursday, the seventh anniversary of Obamacare's very painful passage.\nThis is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare. (Applause.) It's a long-awaited chance. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. What's the alternative? The alternative is what you have -- what you have is nothing. The worst. It's the big lie.\nAnd remember this -- so true -- I happen to like a lot Senator Rand Paul. I do. (Applause.) I do, I like him. He's good. He's a good guy. And I look forward to working with him so we can get this bill passed in some form so that we can pass massive tax reform, which we can't do until this happens. So we've got to get this done before we can do the other. In other words, we have to know what this is before we can do the big tax cuts. We've got to get it done for a lot of reasons, but that's one of them. (Applause.)\nAnd it's important to realize how we got to Obamacare in the first place. Back in 2009 or 2010, House and Senate Democrats forced through a 2,700-page healthcare bill that no one read and no one understood. By the way, today it's thousands of pages more. It's not even understandable. They ignored the public, they ignored the voters, and they jammed a massive failed healthcare takeover right through Congress.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: And this is what we have. It's time for Democrat leaders in Washington to take responsibility for the disaster they and they alone created. (Applause.) Remember when President Obama said, if you like your plan you can keep your plan; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor?\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nobody brings that stuff up, do they? Do they ever bring it up? Matt, I don't think so, right? They don't bring it up. Notice how they forget all those things. Or when the architect of Obamacare said the law was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Or Bill Clinton on the campaign trail -- oh, he must have had a tough night when he went home that night -- (applause) -- called Obamacare the \"craziest thing in the world\" where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. Bill Clinton said that -- the \"craziest thing in the world.\" Or the Democratic governor of Minnesota who said, \"The Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\nIt's been one broken promise after another. People have been kicked off their plans and their premiums have increased by double and triple digits. Arizona up 116 percent. By the way, insurance companies in a great state known as Kentucky -- have you ever heard of it -- (applause) -- are in tremendous trouble, will be fleeing -- and we're going to save it all. We're going to save it all. Tremendous trouble; it's a disaster. (Applause.)\nIn fact, to counter my speech two weeks ago in Congress -- I don't know, did anybody see that speech? (Applause.) They used the former governor of Kentucky -- and the plan doesn't work in Kentucky. But Matt will save us.\nMany of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare. Obamacare has been a complete and total catastrophe, and it's getting worse and worse by the day. And yet you watch the fake media, the fake news and they try to build it up. It's a disaster, fellas. It's a disaster.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Wouldn't it be great if they told the truth about Obamacare? It would be so wonderful to the people of this country, because it would just sail right through. Our plan would sail right through.\nOne-third of the counties in the United States now have only one Obamacare insurer left; some have none. And in your state it's worse. In a recent interview, your governor, Matt Bevin -- who's right here, so I better be careful -- said that \"Obamacare was a disaster in Kentucky.\" Is that right? I'm quoting that so accurately. And it is. It's been an absolute disaster.\nHalf of our counties only have a single provider right now. It's a financial disaster waiting to happen right here in your own state. Thursday is our chance to end Obamacare and the Obamacare catastrophe and begin delivering the reforms our people deserve. (Applause.) Big thing. Then we get to tax cuts. Big thing.\nAnd remember, we're going to negotiate, and it's going to go to the Senate and back and forth. The end result is going to be wonderful and it's going to work great. Once this is done, we are also going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process. (Applause.) Some people think that's just as important as healthcare.\nThe cost of medicine in this country is outrageous. Many times higher than in some countries in Europe and elsewhere. Why? Same pill, same manufacturer, identical, and it's many times higher in the United States. You know why? Campaign contributions, who knows. But somebody is getting very rich.\nWe're going to bring it down. We're going to have a great competitive bidding process. Medicine prices will be coming way down, way, way, way down, and that's going to happen fast. (Applause.) We're just adding to the bill. I said, we've got to add that to the bill. We're going to do a bill later. We're trying to add it to this bill, and if we can't, we're going to have it right after.\nWe have some crazy, arcane laws, folks, just in case you haven't heard. I am confident that if we empower the American people, we will accomplish incredible things for our country, not just on healthcare but all across our government. And, by the way, that Second Amendment is very, very safe right now. (Applause.) I promised. I said we're going to save the Second Amendment. I promise you we are going to save the Second Amendment. It's very, very safe. We would not be in good shape if a certain other person won this election, I could tell you. You would not be happy. And if they came to make a speech, 250 people would have showed up.\nA new spirit of optimism is sweeping across our land, and a new national pride is swelling our hearts and steering our souls. So true. Just imagine what we can accomplish if we stand together as a united American people. Our economy will be unleashed, and millions will be lifted from welfare to work. Got to work. (Applause.) They're going to love it. They're going to love it. From welfare to work.\nOur children will grow up in safe communities, and they will be educated in schools that teach them to love our country and its values. (Applause.) Our inner cities will find a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. And, you know, your San Francisco quarterback -- I'm sure nobody ever heard of him --\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm just reporting the news. There was an article today -- I love to report the news, and then they said I made a mistake, right? I said, no, the people reporting the news made a mistake, if it's wrong. But there was an article today, it was reported, that NFL owners don't want to pick them up because they don't want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump. Can you believe that? (Applause.) I just saw that. I just saw that. I said, if I remember that one, I'm going to report it to the people of Kentucky, because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag, right? (Applause.)\nOur struggling industries are going to be revitalized, and our dying factories will come roaring back to life. It's already happening. And in our dealings with other nations, we will find a new era of security, cooperation, and peace. And we won't be played for the fool, and we won't be played for the suckers any longer. (Applause.)\nThis is the future that awaits us if we embrace our destiny as Americans, which we did. This one of the greatest things, one of the biggest events ever to happen in our country. And we're going to make it even better than anybody ever thought possible. That's happening already. (Applause.)\nWe are one people, and we share one faith. Whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood. (Applause.) We all salute the same great American flag. (Applause.) And we are all made by the same almighty God. (Applause.) As long we remember these truths, we will not fail. Nobody -- nobody -- can beat us. Nobody. We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you. This is your moment. This is your time. And this, the United States of America, is your country again. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!\nTHE PRESIDENT: So with hope in our souls, and patriotism in our hearts, let us now recite these words. Are you ready? Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you. Thank you, Kentucky. God bless you. Thank you.

As you all know, the President will be speaking this afternoon in Louisville, and we've got an event coming up, so I'll try to keep this relatively short to focus on -- let the President focus on his message for the day.\nIn regard to the news of the day, this morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Bill Gates, the co-chair and trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The President and Mr. Gates talked about their shared commitment to finding and stopping disease outbreaks around the world. The President particularly commended Mr. Gates for the Gates Foundation's work in global health and health security. Generous and innovative private philanthropy groups, like the Gates Foundation, are critical to our mission of finding the cures of tomorrow.\nAlso this morning, the confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee began for the President's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. As the judge will continue to show throughout this process, he's eminently qualified for this position, with impeccable academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a proven commitment to the Constitution.\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch will be questioned by each member of the panel. And on Thursday, we anticipate things to conclude with a panel of witnesses.\nThe President was glad to see so many people convey their support in the last few days for Judge Gorsuch. Just this past weekend, Senator Grassley, former New York Mayor Bloomberg, editorial boards from across the country, and several of his former colleagues and classmates either penned op-eds and editorials or provided comments, one way or another, stating his impeccable qualifications for the bench.\nThey add to the long list of jurists, politicians, and elected officials from both sides of the aisle who have already given the judge their support. The President looks forward to watching Judge Gorsuch continue to show the Senate what an extraordinary addition he will be to the bench, and is confident that he will be confirmed.\nLater in the morning, the President had a meeting with Speaker Ryan, Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price, and Dr. Zeke Emanuel. Dr. Emanuel has been intimately involved in crafting healthcare policy since his work on Obamacare. Obviously, he and the President have some differing views on the best way to make healthcare affordable and accessible, but the President also strongly believes that the health and wellbeing of the American people shouldn't always be a partisan issue, and he will continue to reach across party lines and listen to voices on this issue.\nLast week he heard from individuals and families who have suffered from the disastrous results of Obamacare. He's previously spoken to healthcare policy groups, Republican congressional leadership, and health insurance companies. This week, he and his staff will have discussions on women in healthcare while continuing an open dialogue with members of Congress. And he will be hosting even more meetings and listening sessions in the coming weeks as he works with Congress to bring commonsense reforms to our healthcare system.\nThe President has shown that he's willing to hear from all stakeholders in the healthcare field, and he will continue to listen as the process on the American Health Care Act moves along and we pursue the additional legislative and administrative actions necessary.\nThis afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President, and as we speak he's meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson. The Secretary just returned from an important trip to Asia. He made it clear that America is committed to our allies, Japan and the Republic of Korea, and that we expect China to increase its role in persuading North Korea to move away from nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development and toward steps to create a better future for the North Korean people.\nThis trip set the stage for future leader-level engagement between the U.S. and China. During this meeting, he will debrief the President on his trip.\nLater this afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. The Iraqi people have been a brave and steadfast partner in our shared fight against ISIS, al Qaeda, and radicalism. The President will speak with the Prime Minister about how that partnership will help us defeat ISIS and move into a new era in which Iraq is a force for stability and peace and a prosperous Middle East.\nAfter his bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, the President will depart the White House for Louisville, Kentucky for a Make America Great Again Rally before returning to the White House later this evening.\nA few notes at the end before I take some questions.\nYesterday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin returned from a very successful trip to Europe, where he stopped in the UK for a bilateral with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and later met with 18 of his counterparts during the G20 Ministerial in Baden-Baden.\nThis trip gave the Secretary an opportunity to outline the administration's priorities on a number of issues, including macroeconomic policy, financial regulation, international tax, and illicit finance. During the meetings, the Secretary and his counterparts presented a platform that will strengthen our collective work on steps to promote global growth and financial stability.\nIn terms of the schedule for the rest of the week -- tomorrow, the President will sign S. 442, \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017\" in the morning, and make remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner in the evening.\nOn Wednesday, as I mentioned last week, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus.\nOn Thursday, the President will hold an event with truck drivers and representatives from the trucking companies and industry on healthcare and its negative impacts on their industry and livelihood, which just happens to be the largest employer in 29 states.\nAnd on Friday, the President will hold a Greek Independence Day celebration. We'll have further updates on all of those events later.\nAnd finally, I want to address the House Intelligence Committee hearing that is currently happening in which the FBI director and the NSA director are currently testifying and comment to the extent that I can at this time.\nThis hearing, as Chairman Nunes noted, is the first of several that the House Intelligence Committee is engaged in, and the President is happy that they're pursuing the facts in this. As has been previously reported, Director Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating Russia's role in interfering with the election. And let me just comment briefly on that.\nFollowing this testimony, it's clear that nothing has changed. Senior Obama intelligence officials have gone on record to confirm that there is no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion. The Obama CIA director said so, Obama's director of national intelligence said so, and we take them at their word.\nHowever, there was some new information that came from the hearing that we believe is newsworthy about the intelligence-gathering process and the unmasking of Americans identified in intelligence reports, and the illegal leak of such unmasked individuals, which is a federal crime.\nDirector Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that certain political appointees in the Obama administration had access to the names of unmasked U.S. citizens, such as senior White House officials, senior Department of Justice officials, and senior intelligence officials. Before President Obama left office, Michael Flynn was unmasked and then illegally his identify was leaked out to media outlets, despite the fact that, as NSA Director Rogers said, that unmasking and revealing individuals endangers \"national security.\"\nNot only was General Flynn's identify made available, Director Comey refused to answer the question of whether or not he'd actually briefed President Obama on his phone calls and activities. Director Comey called these types of disclosures of classified information a threat to national security, and said he will investigate and pursue these matters to the full extent of law.\nHe also said that the leaking of classified information had become \"unusually active\" in the timeframe in question. It's also important to note that both Directors Comey and Rogers told the committee that they have no evidence that votes were changed in the swing states the President had won.\nI think that pretty much, until we get the ending of this hearing -- I don't know that I want to comment too much further. And with that, I'd be glad to take a few questions.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sean, does the President still have complete confidence in FBI Director Comey?\nMR. SPICER: There's no reason to believe he doesn't at this time.\nJohn.\nQ: You said -- wait, hold on --\nMR. SPICER: I answered you.\nQ: He said that there is no information to support the allegations that the President made against President Obama.\nMR. SPICER: At this time.\nQ: So is the President prepared to withdraw that accusation and apologize to the President?\nMR. SPICER: No, we started a hearing. It's still ongoing. And, as Chairman Nunes mentioned, this is one in a series of hearings that will be happening. As I noted last week, there's also a lot of interesting news coming out of that in terms of the activities that have gone on to reveal the information on American citizens that have been part of this, particularly General Flynn. There's a lot of things that aren't being covered in this hearing that I think are interesting that -- since it's ongoing, I'll leave that for now. But I think there's a lot of areas that still need to be covered. There's a lot of information that still needs to be discussed.\nQ: The director also said he's investigating the links and the possibility of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Given that the President just this morning said that the Democrats made up the Russia story, why would the FBI director be investigating a story if it's simply --\nMR. SPICER: I don't think that's what he said. But again, look at what --\nQ: No, no, he did. He said that he's investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether or not there was any coordination.\nMR. SPICER: Correct. But again, investigating it and having proof of it are two different things. If you look at the acting Obama CIA director, he said that there's smoke but there's no fire. Senator Tom Cotton -- \"Not that I've seen and not that I'm aware of.\" You look at Director Clapper -- \"Not to my knowledge.\" Senator Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware -- \"I have no evidence of collusion.\"\nThere's a point at which you continue to search for something that everybody who's been briefed hasn't seen or found. I think it's fine to look into it, but at the end of the day, they're going to come to the same conclusion that everybody else has had. So you can continue to look for something, but continuing to look for something that doesn't exist doesn't matter.\nThere is a discussion -- I heard some names thrown around before -- that were hangers-on or on the campaign, and I think at some point people that got thrown around at the beginning of this hearing, some of those names, the greatest amount of interaction that they've had has had cease-and-desist letters sent to them.\nQ: You're talking about the Roger Stones and the Carter Pages.\nMR. SPICER: Exactly, the Carter Pages, yes. But those people, the greatest amount of interaction that they had with the campaign was the campaign apparently sending them a series of cease-and-desist letters. So again, I think that when you read a lot of this activity about associates, there is a fine line between people who want to be part of something that they never had an official role in, and people who actually played a role in either the campaign or the transition.\nJulie.\nQ: Sean, I just had two quick questions on the hearing today. Does the President -- now that we know there is an ongoing investigation by the FBI -- does the President stand by his comments that he is not aware of any contacts that his campaign associates had with Russia during the election?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: And then the second one is: Has anyone from the White House --\nMR. SPICER: Well, can I just amend the first one?\nQ: Sure.\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, just to be clear, I know that -- I'm trying to think through this for a second, because obviously General Flynn -- but again --\nQ: Right, particularly during the campaign, before the election.\nMR. SPICER: Right. And I'm not aware of any at this time. But even General Flynn was a volunteer of the campaign, and then obviously there's been discussion of Paul Manafort who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time. But beyond --\nQ: He was the chairman of the campaign --\nMR. SPICER: Hey, Jonathan, hold on. Can you stop interrupting other people's questions?\nQ: (Inaudible) played a limited role --\nMR. SPICER: Hey, Jonathan, somebody is asking a question. It's not your press briefing. Julie is asking a question. Please calm down. Julie.\nQ: Are you saying then that the President is aware of contacts that Manafort had during the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, nothing that hasn't been previously discussed. I just don't want to make it look like we're not aware of the stuff that's --\nQ: Understood. And then the second thing is, anyone from the White House, up to the President, been interviewed by the FBI as part of this investigation?\nMR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of.\nMara.\nQ: You said that -- you made a point of saying that Comey refused to say whether he had briefed Obama about the investigation. And also, the President, on his official account, tweeted the same thing today. Comey made a point today of saying, please do not draw any conclusions from my ability to confirm or deny anything, but you are drawing a conclusion from that.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we're pointing it out. I mean, we're making a point that it is not known. And I think there's further -- I mean, to everyone who was looking for a conclusion today, I think there's a lot more that needs to be discussed and looked at before we can jump to a conclusion about --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. But I think the point is, is that, in the same token you've got individuals that want an answer, and at the same time, there's clearly a lot of information that still hasn't come out or been discussed.\nQ: So you're looking forward to this investigation --\nMR. SPICER: I think that we are -- there is a lot more to come is the answer that I --\nQ: But the reason that I'm asking this question is you said that they are going to come to the same conclusion of everybody else.\nMR. SPICER: My point is, is that --\nQ: So you already know what the conclusion is?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. What I'm getting at is that there is this continuous -- there is this media narrative that continues to talk about collusion that exists, and yet every person that's been briefed -- Nunes; Tom Cotton; Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware; Clapper, the Obama appointee -- have all said that nothing that they've seen makes them believe that there was any collusion.\nAnd I think there's a difference between talking about an investigation into the 2016 election, which we all know, and any evidence of collusion. There is no evidence, according to the people that have been briefed, of any collusion or activity that leads them to believe that that exists. I think that is an important point that gets overlooked over and over and over again.\nQ: Right, but you said it's fine to look into it, but they are going to come to the same conclusion of everybody else -- that this collusion doesn't exist. So you already know --\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't. What I'm --\nQ: -- investigation is finished --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, is that every single person -- because what the director said today is that there's an ongoing investigation. My point is to say that everybody who's been briefed on that investigation -- it doesn't -- there is an assumption that because there is an investigation, it must mean that it's about something.\nMy point to you is that there is an assumption on behalf of most people in the media about what that investigation must mean. And my point to you is, is that, despite the narrative that gets played over and over again with respect to what the investigation might mean in terms of collusion, every person, Republican and Democrat, that has been briefed on it has come to the same conclusion that there is no collusion and that that's over.\nSo while we can talk about an investigation, big-picture holistically, the idea that so many people are trying to jump to a conclusion seems very, very misguided.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two quick ones. First -- briefing with the President, do you expect the invitation to President Xi to that summit that's being reported on for next month to be -- was that extended on that trip? And do you expect that to be taking place early April, the 6th, 7th and 8th?\nMR. SPICER: I'll try to have more of a readout afterwards. I know that they're going to talk extensively about what he accomplished in both Japan, South Korea, and obviously in Beijing. But I'm going to let the Secretary of State debrief the President before I get ahead of deciding what was discussed in Beijing.\nQ: And back to the previous topic. I was hoping you could square the circle a little bit. You said in the case of the President's tweets, on this an ongoing investigation, that more things will come out that may justify that. But in the case of the Clinton charges, you listed all the people who have said (inaudible) investigation there. Why, in one case, is that sufficient to say that there is no -- you could rule out collusion now, versus in the other case you'd say, oh, there is going to be more information coming out that will prove these tweets?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not -- because again, I think there's a difference. I'm not ruling anything out. I'm merely explaining to you that every person -- Republican, Democrat, Obama, that served in the Obama administration across a broad section --\nQ: You can say the same thing about tweets.\nMR. SPICER: In terms of what?\nQ: Wiretappings.\nMR. SPICER: But I think that there is -- on the investigation itself, we know from the people who have been briefed. On the other piece of it, we know that there is -- it's an ongoing thing, and that even according to the Department of Justice in terms of the information that has been provided and Chairman Nunes, that they are still at the beginning of this process. That is a very different thing than a group of people saying there is an ongoing investigation. And from what we've been briefed, there is no evidence to suggest any type of collusion. That's the difference.\nHunter.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On a slightly different topic: In his first eight weeks in office, President Trump has made at least 10 trips to the golf course. He regularly used to criticize President Obama for spending time on the course. How is his golf game any different?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think two things. One is, you saw him utilize this as an opportunity with Prime Minister Abe to help foster deeper relationships in Southeast Asia -- in Asia, rather -- and have a growing relationship that's going to help U.S. interests. How you use the game of golf is something that he has talked about.\nSecondly, we went down to -- he had a mini Cabinet meeting the other day down -- or two weekends ago, down at his club in Virginia. And I remember so many people jumping to the conclusion that he's going down and playing golf. Just because you go somewhere doesn't necessarily mean that you did that. So on a couple of occasions, he's actually conducted meetings there, he's actually had phone calls. So just because he heads there doesn't mean that that's what's happening.\nQ: I know he did meet with Prime Minister Abe on the course, but we're not getting a lot of details on other high-level meetings that are taking place. If he is having these productive meetings on the course, why isn't the President and his aides being a little more forthcoming about what he's doing?\nMR. SPICER: It's the same reason that he can have dinner or lunch with somebody and not -- because I think the President is entitled to a bit of privacy at some point, which is what we've always agreed to. We bring the protective pool to be there, but the President is also entitled to a bit of privacy as well.\nTrey.\nQ: Does the President believe the FBI will do a fair job of investigating any sort of links to Russia during the election? And then I have one more for you.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a variety of institutions looking at it -- both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee, the FBI. But, yeah, I think that when you get to the bottom of it, we'll have a much better picture of what's happening, and I think it will continue to vindicate him on that.\nGo ahead.\nQ: In a follow-up, the President tweeted this morning a question about a potential DNC connection to Russia during the election. Is he under the impression that the Clinton campaign had inappropriate contact with Russia during the election?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that -- and that's an interesting aspect of all of this that's not being covered. Number one, from everything that's been publicly available, on several occasions the DNC was asked by the FBI to investigate -- or to allow their servers to be looked at, despite all of the claims of their concerns about leaking. And yet, the question still doesn't come out -- why wouldn't the DNC, on multiple occasions, rebuff the FBI? Why were they not wanting -- if they were so concerned about hacks and leaking, why did the DNC not ask the FBI to come look? Not only did they not ask them; they rebuffed them on multiple occasions. Why? What are they hiding? What were they concerned of?\nBut I think there is a serious question. I mean, it's not -- they're very clear about the concerns they have, as well as all of the leadership in the Democratic Party. And yet when it came to hacks and leaks out of the DNC -- and they're quick to jump to the conclusion about who did it, and yet they wouldn't allow the FBI to investigate it -- there's a whole second set of concerns here in terms of what was Hillary Clinton's role. I mean, if you look at the Obama administration and the Clintons' involvement with Russia in terms of donations the Clintons received from Russia and entities, the idea that they sold off a tremendous amount of the uranium to the Russian government, and yet where was the concern for that? What are we doing to look into that? It was the Obama administration in 2009 that talked about a reset with Russia and a desire to reset relationships. It was Hillary Clinton who signed off on the deal that gave a Russian company one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply. Where is the questioning about that? What did they get?\nThere was discussion the other day about a Russian official noting that both campaigns they sought to -- where is the concern about their efforts on the Hillary Clinton thing? The Democrats and the Democratic Party, and a lot of those individuals are quick to point fingers, and yet when it comes to discussing their own collusion or questions involving their involvement with Russian officials or buy-offs to the Russians, there's no discussion there. So you got to wonder, on both sides, where's the parity when it comes to these kinds of investigations?\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, what constitutes conclusive evidence for the President on this front when you say there's more to come forward? You've got the FBI director saying nothing to back up the President's tweets about wiretapping, the former head of the DNI, House Intelligence Committees. I mean, you've had a series of officials. So when does this end for the President? Is it March 28th?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of a date, it's a question of where we get answers. If you look at someone like Michael Flynn and you ask the question, how does an American citizen, who should be protected by law from having their identity unmasked, how does that happen? Because you got to think about it just like this: The FBI and all the relevant intelligence agencies have access to this document; they can figure out who it was. Right? So --\nQ: I'm sorry -- who it was?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. In other words, they --\nQ: The wiretapping of the President, that's the claim.\nMR. SPICER: Listen. I understand that. What I'm getting at is that there's a lot of information that we have come to learn about what happened in terms of surveillance throughout the 2016 election and the transition. And when you look at somebody like Michael Flynn and you realize that while they might have been looking at somebody else at that time, how does somebody's name that's protected by law from being disclosed get put out in the public? Why was it put out in the public? Because the people in the intelligence community would have had access to that information. They could have found out who it was. But yet you've got to question why was a name that should have been protected by law from being put out into the public domain put out there? What were the motives behind that? What else do we need to know? Who was behind that kind of unmasking?\nQ: So are you saying the President has evidence that we have yet to see in public?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I am saying that there's a lot more questions that need to get asked about what was being done in terms of surveillance, who was being surveilled, why were they being involved, what techniques -- why are certain people being sort of \"unmasked\" and having their identity known, what was going on. But there's a lot more questions than answers that need to get asked.\nQ: Who does the President trust to provide those answers if not the heads of all those agencies?\nMR. SPICER: And we've talked about this ad nauseam, that the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees are looking into this. Today is the first of several hearings that Chairman Nunes intends to call. Senator Burr has already talked about it. There's a ways to go. And I get that you guys want to know the end of the book right now, but we're on the first chapter of this process.\nSteve.\nQ: So Burr and Nunes, he does trust them to provide --\nMR. SPICER: Of course. We've put out a statement saying so much that we asked them to look into it. So I don't think it should come to any surprise that that's where we have noted multiple times that that's where the President believe the appropriate place and the process for all of these documents to go through.\nSteve.\nQ: The President said he had a lot of meetings over the weekend on North Korea. Who were those meetings with? And what was his reaction to North Korea's test of this new rocket engine?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we continue to be concerned with North Korea's activity. That's why not only have we continued to have conversations with officials in Japan and South Korea, but we continue to urge China to step in and play a larger role in deterring both the ballistic and other missile threats that North Korea plays. I will try to have a further readout on some of those conversations, but I think there is growing concern about North Korea. I think that is part of what Secretary Tillerson is going to be discussing to him during their meeting.\nQ: And did Tillerson get a promise from China to weigh in more on North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: I think he sent a very clear signal that our policy of strategic patience is over. The President and the Secretary of State have an expectation that China employed multiple points of pressure on North Korea. We know that we don't agree 100 percent of the time with China, but as the State Department noted yesterday, both President Xi and Secretary Tillerson agreed that there are opportunities for greater cooperation between China and the United States, and acknowledged that there are and will be in the future differences between the two countries. But I think that Secretary Tillerson's trip continued to -- or helped set us down that path. And I think that the follow-on meetings that the leaders intend to have will be helpful in that vein.\nQ: Given the talk last week about the budget, the priorities for the American tax dollars, the need to cut programs like -- or make cuts to programs like Meals on Wheels, is the President going to consider curbing some of his trips to Mar-a-Lago that the GAO estimates could cost $3 million for the President to Palm Beach? Is he planning to cut those back at all given his feelings about the priorities for the Americans' tax dollars?\nMR. SPICER: I think that is a vast reach to suggest -- I mean, Presidents always travel. And I think the President, wherever he goes, he carries the apparatus of the White House with us. That is just something that happens. The President will continue to go and travel around the country and have meetings to solve the nation's problems.\nAnd again, I think just -- because I know you took a little bit of a shot there, I think even The Washington Post, which is no friend to conservatives, even they sided with us that these false sort of narratives on Meals on Wheels -- it's not a federal program. Three percent of their total budget comes from a block grant that's passed through there. It's a state-run program. They had apparently a phenomenal weekend this week.\nI get that that's a cute program to point at, but it's false and misleading to try to make that narrative stick.\nQ: So to your point that all Presidents travel, no President has traveled so often and so early to their own private residence.\nMR. SPICER: President Bush went to Crawford.\nQ: Not this often and --\nMR. SPICER: I get it, I get it. But at the same time, the President is -- very clearly that he's worked seven days a week. This is where he goes to see his family. He brings people down there. This is part of being President.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Turning back to the meeting with Chancellor Merkel on Friday, did the President and the Chancellor discuss the economic crisis in Greece at all? And given the appointment of two officials to the Treasury Department who have been critical of the International Monetary Fund, does the administration see a new or different role for the IMF in resolving the Greek economic crisis?\nMR. SPICER: Let me refer you to the Treasury Department on IMF. I think the readout that we provided on the Secretary's -- on the Chancellor's visit, rather -- excuse me -- speaks for itself. They spoke at length as far as what they discussed and what they meant. So I'm not going to step on that.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you. Are you aware of any White House officials that are under investigation by the FBI?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Okay. And you mentioned the \"hangers-on\" in the campaign earlier and Carter Page, but there was also a question about Roger Stone. Was he also in that category? Is he someone that the President is still in frequent contact with? Because he's often called an informal advisor to the President and a confidante of his.\nMR. SPICER: Mr. Stone is somebody the President has known for a long time. He worked briefly on the campaign I think until about August of 2015, from recollection. They have talked from time to time but I don't think any time recently. But they had a long relationship going back years where he would provide counsel. And again, he played a role early on in his campaign but ended that role in August of 2015. And I don't know at all when the last time they even spoke was.\nQ: Sean, in the meeting this morning with Gates, did the President's cut in NIH funding come up? And how does he square meeting with Gates and sort of focusing on this whole need to continue medical research and then at the same time want to cut medical research funding by such a large amount?\nMR. SPICER: I know they talked about cures and health, and I think he applauds a lot of the work that they've done overseas in particular. I don't have a full readout on it yet, but I'll try to get you more on it.\nLook, we've discussed the NIH in particular. I think that there's this assumption in Washington that if you don't spend more on a subject that you're not caring as much. When you look at some of the agencies and departments and programs that we've seen, in many cases they're not meeting their mission. And I think there are cost-savings that can be achieved so that you can focus the dollars that are being allocated towards a more effective use of the mission at hand.\nBut it's interesting, only in Washington do you literally judge the success of something by how much money you throw at the problem, not actually whether it's solving the problem or coming up with anything.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, I want to go to a couple of topics. One, back on wiretapping, Comey said he had no information supporting that President Obama wiretapped President Trump. So with that, you have Schiff saying things like there are half-truths coming from this President; no truth, it's dangerous; we're alienating our allies; we need to be able to trust our President. And with that, I'm going to ask you -- and I need an answer for this -- how do you regain trust, as some view him as the boy who cried wolf?\nMR. SPICER: I think if you're citing Adam Schiff's political diatribe at the beginning as some sort of sense of -- he literally went off --\nQ: But you have Comey saying --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. If you want to talk about a series of mistruths and misdirection, I think if you look at that opening statement it was filled with those. So I don't need to use that as some basis for having to respond to you. I was watching a lot of the reporter response on Twitter initially to his sort of diatribe, and I think there were several folks that talked about how he's mischaracterizing and taking things way out of context. So to use that as the basis of some kind of authoritative --\nQ: What about Comey saying there is no information? How do you regain the trust at that --\nMR. SPICER: April, I've addressed this multiple times. At this point, we are at the beginning phases of this and we have a ways to go.\nJohn.\nQ: Wait, I'm not finished. I asked on the budget. On the budget. How -- and this is kind of going back to --\nMR. SPICER: This is number three now.\nQ: Not really; it's number two. Thank you. How is the President contributing to his own role of reducing spending, the deficit and the debt, and his management of spending here at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: There's a lot -- we've used -- the White House, when it looks at a total percentage of the budget, is miniscule. I think that to ask that question is somewhat ironic after seeing Director Mulvaney sit up here the other day and talk about the savings and the cost-cutting measures that we've seen across the entire budget. He sat up here and got grilled on that and answered effectively how the President is looking at efficiencies and duplicity in all programs throughout government.\nSo it's not just a question of here at the White House, but he's looking at it holistically throughout all of government. But then you look at some of the activities the President is personally engaged in terms of the F-35, the next generation of Air Force One, personally getting -- and looking at ways in which we can create a more effective and efficient procurement process. That's one area where I think you're going to see the President personally engage on more and more, is looking at all the stuff that the government buys and how we're doing it, our bidding process in so many ways, especially in the Department of Defense.\nQ: What about salaries? We know three people here are not taking salaries. But what about salaries? I'm talking about since he's making these massive cuts, is the hurt going to come here as well?\nMR. SPICER: Sure. It's not just a hurt, but you bring it up -- there are multiple people here who are not taking salaries. I mean, that is --\nQ: Three,\nMR. SPICER: Huh?\nQ: Three.\nMR. SPICER: No, way more than three, April.\nQ: How many?\nMR. SPICER: I'll get back to you, but there are several individuals that are not taking a salary here. So when you talk about commitment to helping to come serve this government, serve the President and actually help institute a vision, there's a lot of people who have sacrificed tremendously in terms of saying, I'll give up -- I've done very well for myself, this country has benefitted me, this is an opportunity for me to give back -- that there are people well through this organization who have done that.\nJohn.\nQ: The President met with Dr. Emanuel, as you pointed out, a short time ago. He's probably one of the fiercest critics of what the President is trying to do of anybody out there. He's made it quite clear that he believes that this will take us back to worse than we were before the Affordable Care Act came in. What did the President hope to gain by meeting with Dr. Emanuel today?\nMR. SPICER: Well, he's an architect of Obamacare. I think that despite our political and policy differences, he wants to hear ideas not just of him but a lot of people. We've brought in people on both sides of the aisle from both houses, from industry. The idea is to try to make this the best possible -- he talked to Elijah Cummings a couple weeks ago about drug prices. It's not about ideology or party, it's about instituting a patient-centric drug and healthcare system that benefits the American people and gives them the access and the price point that they can get healthcare and actually get coverage.\nSo it is hearing his ideas. It's listening to his suggestions and figuring out if we can make it better. Part of the manager's amendment that Speaker Ryan talked about is in large part because we've been listening and making it better and making it better. And as it continues to work its will through the process, it's not just the current bill but it's also the additional legislation that's part of this overall three-pronged process that we've talked about. So making sure that we do this right and we give the American people the best possible outcome is what this has always been about.\nQ: The Speaker wants to get this in front of the House maybe by Thursday. How much will the plan change between now and then compared to what we saw voted on in the first two committees?\nMR. SPICER: Three. The House Ways and Means Committee --\nQ: And is the President going up to the Hill tomorrow morning?\nMR. SPICER: We don't have any announcements on the schedule at this time. He's going to continue to make sure that we do everything we can, and I'll leave the legislative piece up to Speaker Ryan.\nQ: How much does he think is going to change between what we saw voted on by Ways and Means --\nMR. SPICER: It depends on how much -- look, I think Speaker Ryan detailed some additions and ideas and suggestions on your network yesterday with Chris Wallace that he is considering, and I think as we continue to meet with folks -- there are some staff-level discussions that occurred over the weekend. There will be more later this afternoon. And to the extent that we can make changes that I think enable us to maintain 218 votes, we will do it.\nSara.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There are a number of the President's supporters on the Hill and elsewhere who worry that the President's refusal to drop the whole wiretapping issue will eclipse some of his other accomplishments. What message does the President have for his supporters who worry that this could be a rabbit hole that might diminish the other things he's trying to, like healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: I think there will be a lot of accomplishments, so they don't need to worry. We've got a lot of things coming down the pike, and I think whether it's healthcare, tax reform, his infrastructure plan, reforming government, immigration -- I think we're going to have a lot of things to be very proud of that people on both sides of the aisle are going to be excited to see enacted. And so in due time there will be plenty to be proud of.\nSara.\nQ: You dismiss Paul Manafort as sort of an incidental figure in this campaign. But he worked for the campaign for five months, he was the campaign chairman, he was there for a number of pivotal decisions. So I'm wondering how is that insignificant, and is the White House aware of any contacts between Paul Manafort and Russian operatives or suspected Russian operatives? And is that cause for concern?\nMR. SPICER: Well, just so we're clear: I'm not dismissing Paul Manafort as a hanger-on, I was noting to some other folks, as Jonathan pointed out. With respect to Paul, though, I believe -- and again, I'm not looking to re-litigate the election or -- but I believe Paul was brought on sometime in June, and by the middle of August he was no longer with the campaign, meaning that for the entire final stretch of the general election, he was not involved. And so to start to look at some individual that was there for a short period of time, or, separately, individuals who really didn't play any role in the campaign, and to suggest that those are the basis for anything is a bit ridiculous.\nQ: So are you saying it wouldn't be cause for concern if we found out that Paul Manafort was in contact with Russian operatives or suspected operatives when he was the campaign chairman?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, I think that -- but to intimate that somebody who was there for eight weeks, and definitely not there in the final three months of the campaign played some kind of lasting role that influenced -- you know, again, you realize, I think somewhere between March -- I mean, August 12th or the 15th was when he ended his affiliation with the campaign.\nSo my point is, to suggest now that if you look at the final three months of the campaign where none of the individuals in question that Democrats brought up over and over again today were affiliated with the campaign -- to suggest that that somehow shows some high-level collusion is a bit of a stretch to say the least.\nQ: And is the White House aware of any contacts between Paul Manafort and Russian operatives or suspected Russian operatives?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: He joined in March. Sean, you've been really critical of reports that are based on sources in the past. Today it seems like the two headlines that we got out of the committee were, one, an official confirmation directly from the FBI and the Justice Department that there is an ongoing criminal investigation into whether associates of the sitting President had contacts with Russia and Russian operatives, and whether there was any coordination between those.\nAnd the second headline being that there is an official -- you had questioned in the past, Priebus a couple weeks ago, when there were reports in our paper and others that the FBI director was indicating that there was no support for President's tweets, you said, well, those are just reports; those are not coming from his mouth -- he hasn't said it. Okay, we've now got it from his mouth directly, in open testimony, that there is no evidence that he has to support the President's tweets.\nI guess the question is, do those two facts, which are now on the record and not attributed to anonymous sourcing -- does that cause this White House any concern? And how come you treat the one -- the latter, the one about wiretapping -- you want to say that's just in the early stages, but on the former one, you want to sort of come to the conclusion that the investigation has sort of gotten to the point where you don't have to worry about that because that's all said and done and everybody has come to the conclusion on that? So that seems like you're treating both of those pieces of news very differently.\nMR. SPICER: Well, first, I think your headlines are bad. I'm glad to rewrite --\nQ: I don't think that.\nMR. SPICER: I'd be glad to if you guys are looking for some help. (Laughter.)\nQ: Are you looking for a job?\nMR. SPICER: Our services are at the New York Times' disposal if it comes to writing headlines, and we could probably do a couple things on stories too, if you're willing to go there.\nI think because there's a big difference. One is, literally talking -- there's a big difference. Everyone keeps conflating that there is an investigation into the 2016 election. Got it -- no disagreement there. Right? But I think that there's a question about collusion between anybody. And my point has been to say over and over again, to the dismay of every one of you guys, is that when the people who have been briefed by the FBI about collusion between individuals, the answer continues to be \"no.\" And at some point, take no for an answer.\nWhen these people, both sides of the aisle -- Obama appointees, elected Democrats, elected Republicans -- say \"no evidence suggested,\" at some point it's not just about me, it's about you: Take no for an answer. And realize that the people -- while you can have an investigation, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to jump to the conclusion that, ah ha, it must be about the collusion between those two things.\nThey've talked about this for a long time. The 17 intelligence agencies have talked about an ongoing investigation into Russia's involvement in the election. That's vastly different than jumping to the conclusion and saying that there must be somehow, therefore, a collusion between individuals on one side. They don't talk about all of the Hillary Clinton collusion that may or may not have occurred, and that was a subject that came up with a Russian official, and yet that has not gotten pursued once.\nThere were zero minutes paid on the evening news the other night, when that Russian official said that they had attempted to reach out to both campaigns. Zero minutes. I know, I know -- see, I'm an equal opportunity --\nQ: But can I just ask, does the President need to take no for an answer in the same way that you're urging the news media to on this?\nMR. SPICER: No, because one is a bunch of people who have been briefed who are saying, we haven't seen anything. And one is an ongoing -- because, again, when you ask them, they are getting at -- the President was very clear, and I think there is continuing to be a very, very literal interpretation of his tweet, which is whether or not there was wiretapping. The President understands that you don't literally wiretap people the same way that you did in the '70s and '80s with wires and things in the phone.\nQ: Director Comey didn't focus on wiretapping. He focused on the question of surveillance.\nMR. SPICER: No, but again, I think that we are still at the beginning phase of a look as to what kind of surveillance occurred and why, and that there's a question about what leaks occurred, why they're happening. And again, just Director Comey -- because I believe one of the big headlines that should come out of today is that when he talks about the unusually high amount of leaks that are coming out of this, and classified information leaks, that in itself should be a question: Why is so much information being leaked out now? What are the motives behind it? Who is doing it? And is it threatening our national security? Which I do believe the answer is yes. But there's a lot of other stories.\nAnd that's why I think, with all due respect to your two headlines coming out, I do believe there's a lot of headlines coming out. It's just that the only headlines that people want to write are the ones that support a narrative against this administration, and not one that actually looks into how many times do people say that there was no evidence of something happening; how many times -- or how much classified information is being leaked. There's a lot of headlines that should be written today about a lot of stuff that's ongoing. And I know that we have an ongoing hearing, but there's a lot of other things that need to get discussed and aren't being happening.\nWhy did the DNC not let the FBI look at their servers? Why is that story not -- because I would assume that if somebody was a victim of something, which they have yelled from the rooftops --\nQ: And you --\nQ: The President made the allegation.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on --\nQ: I'm sorry, I'm curious -- the implication of that is what?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, the question is, why is none of that being looked at?\nQ: I understand the question. But --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what the -- but my point is, is that, not to draw an implication, but to merely ask a question, which all I'm getting at is that suddenly none of the questions regarding any of this seemed to get asked or answered or explored. And yet --\nQ: But you won. You're here.\nMR. SPICER: Brian, you get the same treatment that Jonathan does. That doesn't mean you get to jump in. So the answer that I'm getting at is, why are none of those questions being asked? Why is no one taking no for an answer when it comes to all of these individuals saying that they've seen nothing? But there are a series of headlines that I would suggest need to get written and, frankly, stories. I'm glad to do that, as I offered.\nGeorge.\nQ: I'd like to try to clarify two things. In the future, when you, from that podium, read from news articles or cite news articles, can we assume that you're vouching for the accuracy of those articles?\nMR. SPICER: I think merely reading a story that's in a paper is not vouching for it, it's reading the story.\nQ: It doesn't put a White House --\nMR. SPICER: No. I think reading a series of things when asked a question, \"where is this narrative coming from,\" and citing a multitude of stories that are in the public domain is not necessarily endorsing everything I read. That's a silly assertion. We're reading stories that you and your colleagues -- and not necessarily you at National Journal -- have put out, but several people in here whose publication have put something out. Simply reciting those things is not an endorsement.\nQ: The second thing is, when you talked to the British about the GCHQ: thing, did you tell them that the White House would not raise that again? Or can you talk about that conversation?\nMR. SPICER: There was merely an explanation of what we did and why we did it, which is what I just said to you. And that was it -- simply that.\nThank you, guys, for that. We'll see you tomorrow. Hopefully some of you get a chance to go down today. If you don't, we'll have a readout.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123594", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:56 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Hi, guys. The hearing is still -- Judge Gorsuch's hearing is ongoing, and considering the significant attention, I'm going to try to keep this a little on the shorter side today.\nThe President is making a full day of progress towards some of his biggest promises that he's made to the American people. This morning he met with the House Republican Conference members on Capitol Hill, ahead of the House's scheduled vote on the American Health Care Act, which is currently scheduled for Thursday.\nDuring the meeting, the President reminded members of the House Conference that repealing and replacing Obamacare has been a promise that Republicans have been making to voters for years.\nMembers have made it clear that if voters put a Republican in the White House and continue Republican majorities in the House and the Senate that we would repeal and replace this ill-advised legislation.\nAnd for every member who pledged to the American people that they would deliver on this promise, this is really their chance. This is the repeal of Obamacare that Republicans have been working on for years, and voters have been waiting for this for some time.\nOn Thursday, as the House gathers on the floor and casts their votes for the ACH, it will be exactly seven years after President Obama had signed Obamacare into law. We're hoping to make this the last anniversary Americans will have to endure Obamacare. Republicans have been working to repeal and replace this misguided law ever since. And now, under President Trump, we will finally be able to take this step towards fundamental reform of our healthcare system.\nI think most Americans remember the lines that were used to sell Obamacare seven years ago: \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\" \"If you like your healthcare plan, you'll be able to keep your healthcare plan.\" But for millions of Americans, those lines proved to be nothing more than empty promises. Plans that their families had relied on for years were suddenly cancelled. Premiums and deductibles skyrocketed, leaving many who had plans unable to actually use them. And insurers fled the marketplace. Nearly one in five Americans only have one insurer offering plans on their Obamacare exchange.\nPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress will keep their promise by reforming the system once and for all. And that's exactly what we're doing with the American Health Care Act, which, along with the additional legislative and administrative action that is part of the three-prong approach that we continue to outline, will finally give all Americans the healthcare system they deserve, where market-based competition leads to more affordable, higher-quality care opportunities.\nThis is an ongoing process, and the President has made it clear to Congress that they should be open to incorporating some of the common-sense policy proposals that have been suggested by members in both chambers who share their commitment to improving the healthcare system. To that end, the House introduced several technical and policy amendments to the legislation last night, which the President acknowledged on Capitol Hill this morning.\nThey include: Delivering more immediate relief from Obamacare's taxes, accelerating the repeal of these taxes from 2017 rather than from 2018, and ensuring that millions of Americans who paid Obamacare's penalties or taxes can reclaim their hard-earned dollars from the IRS.\nIt's making it easier for Americans to deduct more of the costs of their medical expenses.\nProtecting life by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to help purchase insurance plans that currently cover abortion.\nGiving states additional flexibility for their Medicaid program covering traditional adult and children populations, while maintaining baseline funding for elderly and disabled populations.\nGiving states the ability to implement optional, reasonable work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents as part of their Medicaid programs.\nFreezing Obamacare's Medicaid expansion while allowing for a responsible unwinding, so that people who enroll before 2020 will continue to be supported by the program.\nAnd providing a more generous reimbursement for elderly and disabled Medicaid enrollees, recognizing that those populations have unique needs that must be taken care of.\nAfter a return to the White House from the House -- speaking to the House Republican Conference, the President received his Daily Intelligence Briefing. Then the President signed S.442, the NASA Administration Transition Authorization Act for 2017, acting on another of the President's most ambitious promise to the American people. Many may recall in his joint address, the President said of a dream.\"\nAnd with this bill, he is taking the latest step towards making that dream a reality by reiterating NASA's mission to ensure America remains a leader in space exploration.\nThis bipartisan, bicameral legislation provides NASA with the full support it needs to fulfill this and many other important missions, including: supporting NASA's plan to explore deep space and sending astronauts to Mars, including an endorsement of launching the Mars 2020 Rover. The rover will explore a site that is likely to have been habitable, seeking signs of past life and testing compelling samples and techniques for future robotic and eventual human exploration of Mars.\nReaffirming that NASA remains a fully multi-mission agency with a balanced set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight, exploration, and education.\nEndorsing NASA's continued progress towards launching the James Webb Telescope, which will be a giant leap forward in our ever-evolving quest to understand the universe, and establishing an astronaut occupational healthcare program, something that NASA has considered a priority for years.\nAfter the bill signing, the Vice President also announced that the President will be taking action shortly to relaunch the National Space Council, which the Vice President will chair. The President was honored to sign this new bill into law so that NASA can continue its work towards making America the world leader in space exploration once again.\nAlso this morning, the President -- the Vice President, rather, hosted a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. We provided a readout on the President's meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday as well, and I believe there has been a readout of the Vice President's as well.\nAt 3:00 p.m. this afternoon, the President will meet with members of Congress who are part of the House Tuesday Group to discuss the American Health Care Act. And this evening, the President will speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner.\nOver on the Senate side of the Hill, the President's pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch has been doing a phenomenal job in the Senate today during his first day of questioning. The judge's eloquent testimony yesterday was widely praised from both sides of the aisle, and it's clear that everyone agrees, from a broad spectrum, that Judge Gorsuch is a very qualified person to serve on the Supreme Court.\nAs the Judge noted today, \"a judge is there to make sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty or meek, gets equal protection of [under] the law.\" His records show that he has lived up to this commitment throughout his entire career, and he's continuing to prove that he is exactly the type of jurist we need on the Supreme Court throughout the questioning that's started today.\nToday is also National Agriculture Day, for those who are keeping note. The world needs America's farmers and ranchers to lead, just as the world needs America to lead. Global food demand is expected to increase by 50 to 97 percent by 2050. The world can't afford for America's farmers and ranchers to retreat, but the agriculture industry has met its share of challenges in recent years. While our farmers are the most efficient in the world, margins have been tightening, regulations have been multiplying, and exports, which have historically counted for over one-fifth of U.S. farm production, have been declining due to unwise trade policies.\nThe President promised the many people in the agriculture industry and throughout rural America that he would not allow this to continue, and he will continue to pursue policy changes that will reverse this disturbing trend.\nQuickly, in terms of follow-up from yesterday, I was asked about North Korea, and I wanted to provide an update from the NSC: \"The United States, in coordination with our allies, is exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, and economic measures in response to the grave and escalating threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\"\nAnd before I open it up for questions, let me run through a few scheduling updates. Tomorrow, the President will stop by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by CMS Administrator Seema Verma. There will also be a series of meetings with members of Congress tomorrow. In the morning, the President will meet with members to discuss the American Health Care Act. And in the afternoon he will meet with congressional -- members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\nOn Thursday, the President will have lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin before hosting a meeting with truckers and representatives from trucking companies on healthcare that we discussed yesterday. In many states throughout the country, trucking happens to be one of the largest employers, and it's important to understand the impact of healthcare legislation on this important industry.\nI'll have updates on the weekend schedule for you hopefully tomorrow. And finally, yesterday, pursuant to the President's executive order on interior enforcement that he signed on January 25th, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, ICE, released its first weekly list of detainee requests, which local law enforcement agencies have failed to comply with. These examples where criminal illegals who have been arrested or convicted, in many cases, of serious and violent crimes threaten public safety. In each instance, local law enforcement is refusing to cooperate with ICE in its efforts to remove illegal immigrants who have committed a crime. It is part of the President's continued efforts to keep our communities safe.\nA copy of this report is available on the ICE website that details all of the municipalities where there has been an issue and the crime that has been committed, and the person -- not necessarily the person's name, but the offense in which they were convicted for.\nAnd with that, I'd be glad to take a few questions. Since we're talking Supreme Court -- John Roberts. (Laughter.) Come on. That was good.\nQ: Unless there's an Alito in the audience. On healthcare, the President came away from Capitol Hill sounding pretty positive about where he was going to go on Thursday, but then at the same time, Heritage Action came out and said it was going to encourage members to vote \"no.\" Club for Growth is taking out ads attacking this bill. Jim Jordan said the President's great, but it's still a bad bill. This is going to go to a vote day after tomorrow. What gives the President the sense of optimism that he can get this through, and might he request more changes from Speaker Ryan before it goes to a vote?\nMR. SPICER: Well, we've talked about this for days. There's been a lot of input from members of Congress, and I think that the meeting this morning really was a huge sign of support. There was a lot of enthusiasm and optimism, not just for the bill itself but for something that, as I noted, conservatives and Republicans and a lot of Democrats, frankly, have been fighting for for a while, which is a more patient-centric healthcare system.\nI think the President is continuing to engage with members. He will continue to do that all the way through Thursday. But as I also noted, there were a lot of changes that were made by the Speaker last night, additional legislation -- the three-pronged approach that we've talked about in the past has been put forward to actually make sure that members understood the comprehensive nature of this.\nThis is one vehicle. There's a huge administrative piece that Secretary Price will administer through administrative action that was given to them when they passed this bill and gave that authority to Kathleen Sebelius, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to implement pieces that they couldn't get done legislatively.\nWe can now unwind a lot of that and add a lot of consumer-based and competition measures through the administrative thing. But then the third prong, all the other stuff that we've talked about for years as Republicans -- buying across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, et cetera, et cetera -- all of that has now been introduced as well. And I think that he continues to meet with members and walk away with a very, very optimistic view of where the bill is headed. I think a lot of the measures that have been changed and tweaked and updated have assuaged members who had concerns or wanted to see some additional tightening.\nBut keep in mind, if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance. If you are a conservative who has been looking to address out-of-control entitlement spending, this is the first attempt -- this is the first reform of an entitlement program in terms of Medicaid in 30 years. These are a truly conservative set of principles that we are fighting for. The competition that's in the bill, the ability to allow prices to come down and choice to go up, there is nothing more conservative than there is in this bill. And I think as members continue to talk about ideas that have been included in this bill, and the principles of it, we feel very good going into the final stretch.\nQ: But may he seek more changes in order to further assuage some --\nMR. SPICER: It's possible. But I think that we've made some very positive steps forward. So I don't want to rule anything out, but I will say that I feel very good about this where it stands now. And I think the more and more that members meet with the President, the more they understand how important this is to the overall agenda that we're seeking to pass. And I think if we can -- as the President noted this morning to members, if you can repeal Obamacare, replace it with a healthcare system that does what conservatives and independents, and, frankly, some Democrats have talked about it for years, that does exactly that kind of thing -- instill choice, drive down costs, allows people to actually get care that they've been promised, and then get on to things like tax reform -- we will have an amazing first year in office.\nAnd I think the President reminded them this is the first step in an amazing agenda that he set forth and that we can work together on.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Members of this administration have talked about the stock market as a real-time barometer for how the administration is performing. But this afternoon, though, the stock market has been off as much as 200 points on the Dow. Some commentators on Wall Street are suggesting that's because traders are starting to sense a lack of progress in the Trump legislative agenda, worried that he might not be able to accomplish everything he set out to do. Does the President believe that today's dip in the Dow is the result of his performance as President of the United States?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think to look at any one day is nothing that we've ever -- we've always cautioned. I think overall it still continues to be up tremendously. And I think when you look at not just that one indicator -- I think if you want to get a -- I mean, you probably know better than anybody in terms of what you guys cover -- that you can't look at one indices and say that that is the benchmark of an entire economy. But you see confidence levels, both in small business and in other surveys, that show that there is continued confidence in the market and optimism in the market. You see manufacturers coming back to America, talking about investment; major CEOs and small businesses trying to grow the economy and talking about job creation. Those are the real indicators.\nAnd again, I think the numbers that we saw last month -- again, one month doesn't make a record. But I think that it was very promising, not just because of what the number was, but what it had been forecast to be -- right? So it was expected to be 200,000; it came in at 235,000. So, again, when you're over-performing, I think that shows a sign of optimism and confidence in the market.\nI think -- again, I just want to make sure that we're clear before we go into -- as we continue through the months. One report does not make something to base an entire record off of. But I think that we feel very good about where things are headed and the direction things are going, not just in terms of the indices and the ups and downs in the market, but also in terms of the number of manufacturers that are walking in and restating their commitment to grow jobs, expand, et cetera, in the market.\nQ: -- feel confidence that President Trump will be able to get a tax cut done this year that would be in place for next year, is that something we should worry about at all?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think we're well on our way to seeing this agenda done. The President has rolled out the budget, which I think reaffirmed his commitment to fiscal austerity and to the priorities he set out of defending this country, making the increases in national defense and homeland security that he promised, prioritizing other things in the budget. We've got Obamacare done, on immigration, executive order-wise.\nAnd I think that when you're doing big things -- Obamacare, tax reform -- I mean, the healthcare system is a fifth of the economy; that's not small fee. And I think in terms of what you've seen so far -- going through three committees, moving along -- the Senate ready to take it up, his pick of Neil Gorsuch -- the agenda is moving along at a very brisk pace in terms of what his priorities were and where I think we're headed.\nQ: Sean, last month, I guess, you talked to us about the consideration, potentially, of the carbon tax, which I guess was discussed in a meeting at the White House. We're hearing some reports that there's a pretty lively internal debate. Gary Cohn might be someone who's more prone to that. Can you just discuss, is the President considering a carbon tax? And what are sort of the various things that are going on in the White House with that?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a robust debate going on with respect to comprehensive tax reform. And as we've mentioned, I mean, our goal right now is to get through Thursday, and that's what the President has talked about very publicly. We need to get Obamacare repealed and replaced, and move on to tax reform and some of the other trade reviews that we've talked about -- immigration. There's a lot of things on the agenda. But I'm not going to comment on specific prongs of that. I will just tell you that obviously there's a lot of people who recognize that we haven't have comprehensive tax reform since 1986, and that there's a lot of pieces in this that we need to examine and get to and there's a lot of voices and opinions that get shared with him.\nSo I'm not in a position where I'm going to get into commenting piecemeal on where it is, but I will say that's even more reason that we -- let's get past Thursday. When you look at the week ahead real quick, Glenn, in terms of this, the repeal-and-replace aspect and Gorsuch, I think, from a legislative standpoint -- going back to Eamon's question -- I think it's a pretty big week for the White House to seeing all this done.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. President Trump has previously indicated that he wanted to appoint pro-life judges who would be willing to overturn Roe vs. Wade, yet in his testimony today Judge Gorsuch said he would have walked out the door if President Trump asked if he had this position. Is President Trump still confident that Judge Gorsuch would be willing to overturn Roe vs. Wade? And is this position still important to him?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's comments speak for themselves. I think the President's list that he's put out on 20 are jurists that both the Federalist Society and Heritage have deemed to be people who interpret the Constitution as originalists, as people who aren't looking to legislate from the bench. And I'm not going to take the bait during a live hearing to comment on that but I appreciate the effort.\nRonika.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions on the same story. Recently a 14-year-old girl, she was raped in the boy's bathroom of her high school. A 17- and 18-year-old boy have been charged. One of the boys we know unlawfully entered the country; both of them have outstanding orders with ICE. So here's my first question about it: Currently, schools are prohibited from denying access to public education based on immigration status. Does the President hear a story like that and think that it should change or be addressed in a future executive order?\nMR. SPICER: I think first, let me just say that this is a tragic event, and it's horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I can't possibly imagine. So first of all, let's remember the human side of this, that this is a tragic event that no child, no person, no parent should ever have to deal with. Schools should be a place where a parent puts their child on a bus or drops them off or sees them off and knows that they're safe. And the idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific, and whatever other words that come to mind that someone can think of.\nBecause this is not -- schools should be a safe place where children are there to learn and to feel safe. In that kind of environment -- to know that this happened and the circumstances\n-- this young women in particular fought to come to this country legally because of the freedoms and the treasures of this nation. And to think that this kind of tragedy would occur to someone who's personally endured that kind of struggle to come to this nation and then face this is reprehensible. And it is not who we are as a country.\nI think it is troubling, and I think further, to your question, the President recognizes that education is a state-run and a local-run issue. But I think it is pause for concern what happened there, and I think the city should look at its policies. And I think that this is something that authorities are going to have to look at.\nI think from an immigration standpoint, clearly to see somebody -- there are so many facets of this case that deserve question -- why was there a -- I think he was 17 or 18 years old -- 18, thank you -- and how does that person get put into the ninth grade? Why was -- there are so many issues that come up in this case.\nI will leave it to authorities to get to, but I think that we are in the early stages of this and there's a lot that needs to get addressed with respect to this case in particular.\nQ: So I hear you about it being a state issue. Let's talk about something, though, that the President has implemented and introduced VOICE -- VOICE, Victims of Immigration Crime Enforcement -- is that enough to support a --\nMR. SPICER: No, it's one piece. The President understands that victims need a voice, which is why he brought it in there, to help them when they're specifically targeted or victims of a crime by people who are here illegally. But I think part of the reason that the President has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this.\nWe act so many times when we talk about this and say -- how is the President going to -- why is the President dealing with this -- because of this priority. Well, part of the reason is because of the tragedy that this young girl dealt with, had inflicted upon her, whatever the word is -- this is why he's passionate about this, because people are victims of these crimes in terms of them -- they're victims of the economic pieces, there's a national security. But immigration pays its toll on our people if it's not done legally.\nAnd this is another example, and it's why the President is so passionate about this. But he recognizes that it's multifaceted, why we have to be tough at the border, why I just read off that this executive order is dealing with people who have committed crimes who local enforcement agencies, our municipalities of -- at the state level are not dealing with it.\nAnd if you go to the ICE website and download this, you'll see it's over 30-something pages of cases where there's a person that is convicted of a crime that local people -- local municipal law enforcement, for whatever reason -- and in some cases they're prohibited but for one reason or another are not enforcing the law and not turning that individual over to federal authorities to be deported. And I think this is another example of why this issue needs to be addressed.\nJon.\nQ: Sean, is the President going to hold Republicans who vote against healthcare accountable? Are they going to pay a price if they vote against this bill?\nMR. SPICER: I think they'll probably pay a price at home, meaning I think that you can't go promise over and over again, since 2010 -- in the case the member has been there that long, but at least for those who have been there that long and at least -- and even the new ones -- this was a major component of the last election. And I think there is probably not a single Republican member in itself who went out and talked about this.\nAnd I think when you realize the components of this bill and that the President worked with the House and the Senate to put something together that achieved a promise that was made to voters, yeah, I think there's going to be a price to be paid, but it's going to be with their own voters. And they're going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them and then didn't follow through.\nAnd one of the things that's interesting that people who agree or don't agree with the President in terms of legislative agenda, at least give him high remarks regardless of whether or not they subscribe to his agenda, for keeping his word and his promises. And I think that's one of the things that he's made very clear this morning.\nWe pledged to the American people at the congressional level, at the Senate level, at the presidential level to go do something. And this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. It's repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle but in a lot of these cases back through 2010.\nMargaret.\nQ: Will he campaign against those Republicans?\nMR. SPICER: Let's get through the vote. I think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so I'm not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today. And he made it clear to members that for those of you who go out there and keep your word and support it, we're going to make sure that we remember those who stood by us and who stood by the word that they gave to their voters.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thanks. Okay, so I was actually -- that's one I was going to ask, but let me try to --\nMR. SPICER: Oh.\nQ: No, that's okay, I've got another one, don't worry. So my other one -- but I'm going to go back to that -- is on the laptop restrictions by the U.S. and now the UK, it certainly sounds like that may have been in response to some kind of a specific security threat. What can you talk about from the podium in as much specificity as you can, and if you can't do specifics at least to help us to understand -- are there multiple threats, is there one threat, what is going on here?\nMR. SPICER: So yesterday the TSA announced new enhanced measures on flights inbound to the United States from 10 of more than the 250 countries that have flights coming into the United States that serve as the last point of departure. I think even ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, who we've not always shared the same point of view with, even agreed by saying, \"These steps are both necessary and proportional to the threat.\"\nElevated [Evaluated] intelligence that we're aware of indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation and are aggressive in pursuing innovative methods to undertake their attacks to include smuggling an explosive device in various consumer objects. Base on this information, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the TSA administrator determined that it's necessary to enhance security procedures for passengers at certain last-point-of-departure airports.\nThat being said, I'm not going to go any further than that, and I would refer any further comment to the TSA.\nQ: Can I try what I was going to try out earlier then? Mark Meadows -- seems like a nice guy -- and the President seemed like he was kind of joking, but has the President decided in his own mind yet whether he thinks it would be appropriate potentially to mount primary opposition, to campaign for primary opposition in Republican congressional midterms?\nMR. SPICER: Mark Meadows is a long-time early supporter of the President. He had some fun at his expense this morning during the conference meeting, and I think he continued to express hope that Congressman Meadows, who's the head of the Freedom Caucus, would continue to see the efforts that have been made to make this better and address a lot of the concerns out there.\nBut he has made it very clear that he was having fun with him. The President is committed to making sure that this gets passed. We'll go from there.\nVivian.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. First a follow-up to Margaret's question. Why wait for the new aviation regulations 96 hours to implement it? Isn't the President's mantra on counterterrorism that we have to kind of sneak up on our enemies, not let them know our tactics?\nMR. SPICER: So I'm going to ultimately you refer you back to TSA, but I will tell you that -- remember that these are 10 airports of last point of departure to the United States out of 250 that come here. Part of it is to allow -- you have to provide appropriate notification to the host country, to the host airlines, and give them opportunity to get those procedures in place.\nI'm not going to comment any further about the security measures that have been taking place or are taking place just to continue to refer you back to TSA. But I will tell you that I think that implementing something of this nature in that timeframe is pretty darn quick.\nQ: Okay, and one more -- sorry, I had a follow-up --\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: Sorry. Something totally unrelated. I wanted to ask, has the White House Counsel approved Ivanka Trump getting a West Wing office and clearance? And so what is the administration's thinking behind this? What is she going to do as the --\nMR. SPICER: I don't think the counsel actually approves office space, but I get your questions.\nQ: Right.\nMR. SPICER: Ivanka has taken on several measures to promote high standards of ethical conduct. Even though she's not a federal employee, she'll follow the restrictions that would apply if she were. She's taking these steps with advice of counsel and in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics.\nHallie.\nQ: Two for you. One on healthcare, to follow up on the follow-ups. You've made very clear that the President was going to be supporting those who supported the bill. And I want to talk about the flip side of that, but when he talked this morning in the closed-door meeting about people paying a price, losing seats, not get the majority -- is that an implied threat from the President to the members that don't back this bill\nMR. SPICER: No, I think it's a political reality. I think if you go out and promise the American people something and your voters something, especially on a scale like this -- and, frankly, as I said, there's obviously members that have been there one term, two terms, three terms, but this is something that as a party we've made very clear -- if you give us this, American people, we will get this done. And I think that to go and make a promise and a pledge of this magnitude and not to follow it through, I'm sure that voters would be upset.\nAnd we've seen this in the past. And it's something that I think the President, as I mentioned earlier, has staked -- has earned high marks for, is keeping his word. And I think the President was stating a political reality -- if we go out there and make these pledges to the American people and don't do what we've said we've done on these big things, then I don't think they're going to continue to want to see us in the majority and they're going to look for an alternative.\nQ: And the second, just about -- will he remember the names of those who don't back the bill?\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) We'll see.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Actually, on yesterday, I just wanted to clarify that.\nMR. SPICER: -- on counting -- it's like CBO. (Laughter.) Sorry. Come on, that was --\nQ: Do you want to elaborate on that one?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't. Please go ahead.\nQ: I do want to ask about the Russia testimony from yesterday. I know you obviously addressed it from the podium hours ago, but there was sort of this interesting moment that happened a little bit after the briefing, where Director Comey was asked about the live tweets coming from the President in his account at the same time that the hearing was happening. And Director was fact-checking the President in real time, essentially saying he was incorrect in what he was tweeting. Is there concern on the part of the White House about the President's credibility in that situation, that his own Director is correcting his tweets and what he's saying in real time?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, let's just be clear. I mean, he was answering questions. I mean, it's not like he was out there -- he was responding to a question. But again, I think it's important to note, with respect to this -- and I saw a couple comments yesterday -- Senator Coons took issue with a couple of the comments that we made. Let me just read you -- I know you guys love this when I do this, so I'm just going to entertain you for a second -- Senator Chris Coons -- this is his quote, direct quote -- \"I have no hard evidence of collusion.\" Director Clapper, \"Not to my knowledge.\" Senator Tom Cotton, \"Not that I've seen and not that I'm aware of.\" This is in reference to any type of collusion with Russia that occurred.\nObama's Acting CIA Director Morell, \"There's smoke but there's no fire.\" Senator Chuck Grassley after the Comey briefing -- I can say #POTUS and #Clapper are both right, no evidence of Trump collusion with the Russians.\nSo we've now gone over this on multiple occasions, but at some point there is a distinction between an investigation that goes into Russia's involvement in 2016 and this continued narrative that falsely tries to link the Trump -- the President or the White House into any of it. They continue to see that there is nothing there. Every single person who has been briefed who has come out and publicly talked about it -- Republican, Democrat, former DNI, former CIA directors, Obama appointees -- have said no evidence.\nAnd so I get that -- we keep getting asked --\nQ: That's not my question.\nMR. SPICER: But my point is, is that -- that was one of the tweets, though, that he addressed. He said, former DNI continues to note -- and that was actually true. These are their quotes. This is what they've said. So it's not a question -- I think sometimes you come back to us -- at some point, the question has to be to the individuals who said this -- whether it's Chris Coons from Delaware, or former Director Clapper, or former CIA Acting Director Morell -- they're the ones who've said these things on the record. They're the ones who've been briefed by the intelligence community, by the FBI, and come out and said there is no collusion.\nAnd so, at some point, to fact-check the President for merely quoting them is not -- the question should be directed at them, not us. But over and over again, it's come to the same conclusion.\nSo, Kaitlan. All right, John. Then Kaitlan. That was very nice of you. It's National Ag Day afterwards --\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Kaitlan. I have two questions. First, the author David Horowitz, in his book, The Big Agenda, writes of what he calls \"a deep state,\" in which he said these are Obama holdovers in government who are trying to undercut the President's agenda. This has been widely repeated on social media. Does the President himself believe in this deep state?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I've been asked this question before and I'll give you the same answer I've given before, which is I think there are people that burrow into the government after an administration -- this is going back since the beginning of time. They used to call it ramspecking -- it's suddenly no longer permitted in terms of that same way. But this has been going on since the country was -- country came to be, where people burrow in after an administration into a civil servant job. But, sure, there's people, after eight years of Obama that found their way into government, so it should be no huge secret.\nOkay?\nQ: Yes. Another question on --\nQ: What was that again?\nQ: -- that word?\nMR. SPICER: Ramspecking? Oh, Google it.\nQ: I remember -- I remember when --\nQ: How do you spell it?\nMR. SPICER: You ever seen my spelling? Come on. (Laughter.) Ramspecking. It was named after -- we're going to go through a history lesson here, guys.\nQ: My other question was, over the weekend, Governor Graco Ramirez, the head of the Mexican Governors Association, was again in Washington, and in a much publicized statement said that Mexico had scored its first victory over the proposed wall. He said that in the President's budget there's a line item for $2.6 billion --\nMR. SPICER: In FY'18.\nQ: -- in tax dollars, and no mention of Mexico paying for the wall in any way. He's claimed a victory in that. Your response to Governor Graco Ramirez?\nMR. SPICER: It's a little early to be claiming victory. I think the President has made it clear that he was going to use the current process to start the construction of the wall and that there would be ways that that fulfillment of that pledge would come true.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Thank you. The administration and the President have repeatedly said that over the next few weeks they will present evidence that he was wiretapped. And last week he said it would be coming this week and he may speak on it this week. Can we expect the President to, this week, present evidence that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama? Or will he speak about it? Because he didn't mention it last night in his rally.\nMR. SPICER: Let's see how the week goes.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, when we heard from the President before talk about the need for this healthcare plan to pass, he's talked about the important steps of tax reform and the rest. At what point do you think that his agenda could be imperiled as you look at the vote count? Because you're also going to have a further fight, of course, to get any of this through the Senate.\nMR. SPICER: So, at what point will the vote count --\nQ: This seems to be such a centerpiece of the rest of the President's agenda. So given that it's still not any -- there's no certainty in terms of passage at this point, how concerned are you that Thursday could imperil the President's agenda?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think it's -- the President's visit this morning was very well received. I think we continue down the path to get the votes. We got a ways to go. We got to get to the Senate next. But I think members understand that this is something that has been at the heart of what Republicans have campaigned, and I feel we -- I feel very good headed into this. The President continues to talk to members, and we're going to make sure that we grow the vote as much as we can.\nBut with respect to the rest of the agenda, I think all of the issues that the President campaigned on are things that the House and the Senate both look forward to taking up. Whether it's trade or immigration or comprehensive tax reform, all of these issues are stuff that many Republicans have campaigned on for a long time and are eager to get going.\nThe President has made it very clear, as he did last night, as well, that, look, part of the -- we've got to keep moving along if we want to get big things done. There's a lot that can be done during this administration, during the first term, and he wants to get as much of it done as possible. And so the quicker we get repeal and replace done, and put the American Health Care Act in place, the better. I mean that's just the nature of it.\nBut I think when you look at the speed in which we've moved, it's been very responsible. We've allowed the committees to work their will. The House has taken up the amendments. It's been online. So this is -- there's always a balance between jamming it down and getting it done and over with, which is how the Democrats operated at one point when they finally moved on their bill versus how this is done. But I think we've stricken a very nice balance on this.\nQ: At which point will be it Trumpcare? The President said today it could happen when we asked during the photo spray.\nMR. SPICER: We'll have to see. Right now it's the American Health Care Act, and we're trying to get it done.\nAnita.\nQ: Two questions. First, the Kansas legislature is on the verge of possibly passing a Medicaid expansion, and the current version of the healthcare bill does not allow states to pass that. And so I'm wondering -- as you know most legislatures are currently meeting across the country. Will there be an exception for states if they expand before any new bill comes to --\nMR. SPICER: It would have to be addressed in the legislation. I don't believe there's an exception clause, so I don't -- but I also don't -- it would be -- far be it from me to say at this point, the bill is getting ready to move to the House, the legislation is meeting. I don't want to prejudge the outcome yet. But I don't believe from my understanding that there is any kind of like clause that says \"if.\"\nQ: And secondly, tomorrow -- you mentioned the Congressional Black Caucus. Is there a specific topic -- healthcare, five topics? What can you tell us about the President's message to them? And how did it come about? I know there's been some back and forth on getting a meeting going, how did that come about?\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) April is -- okay, don't drag April into that. (Laughter.)\nQ: Didn't say a name, didn't say a name.\nMR. SPICER: This has been something that the President has talked about for a while. He met with Congressman Elijah Cummings. He started off in a phone call probably a month or so ago where they discussed prescription drugs and the need to get it down; and then the conversation continued. Our legislation affairs team early on went to some of their meetings and started having a dialogue with them, and that dialogue continued. And there was a desire to have a meeting. The President wanted to have them down.\nI think there's going to be a range of issues that get discussed that range from drug prices to infrastructure, investment in education, HBCUs. There will be a range, and I think that's part of it. There's no set agenda to say we must talk about these things. And obviously, I think healthcare is going to come up, too. The President wants to get their idea. Before April jumps out her seat, we'll give her --\nQ: Thank you for giving a follow-up. I want to follow up on the CBC, and I have another question on another subject. So with the CBC, since you're saying you went through all of this prior to the fact that he became President, that there was an effort to reach out to the CBC. So with all of this understanding that they are an important to deal with in handling some of the issues, the urban issues, or issues that pertain to their community, how does the President plan to move forward in working with them, particularly as some just don't see eye-to-eye with him?\nMR. SPICER: I think part of it is it continues to have a dialogue, April. I mean, it's simply sitting down with people, talking about issues, talking about common ground. I think if you look at the conversation that he began and continued with Congressman Elijah Cummings, they found common ground. The President talked about areas where, despite some of the narratives that are out there, there were issues that they probably both share concern for and that they can work on together. And maybe they won't agree on 100 percent or 60 percent, but maybe there's 15, 20, or 30 percent of the issues. Maybe there's one bill in particular that they can work on.\nBut there's a willingness to sit down and talk, and I think that's the first step in the process of any of these. It's not just your own party -- and the President has shown this on several of these meetings -- where it's not just business leaders. He's brought in the union leaders. We talked about healthcare; yesterday, he had Dr. Zeke Emanuel in. It's not about just bringing in people who agree with you, it's about people across the spectrum who can offer ideas. And the President -- and I get it that inner cities aren't exclusive, the rebuilding of inner cities aren't the only issue. But he's talked about -- he's elevated the status of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, bringing that office into the White House to help coordinate some of the federal government activities. He's talked about rebuilding the inner cities. He's talked about school choice. A lot of issues that --\nQ: Law and order.\nMR. SPICER: Law and order, and healthcare. And there's issues that impact urban areas, minority communities, whether they live in rural areas or urban areas. But I think that that dialogue needs to continue because it can only help, and I think that that's what we look forward to tomorrow.\nQ: And the second subject -- as you're talking about bringing in groups, you're also bringing in truckers. And there is a concern in the trucking industry about something like e-logs that's going to happen at the end of the year, where truckers -- be it truckers with commercial trucks, or mom-and-pop businesses -- all of them are going to have computers to log in, to monitor the time you drive, the stop and speed, et cetera. And many people are saying that it cuts into their income. Where does the President stand on that?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I think let's see if that comes up in the meeting, and I'll have a readout. But I know --\nQ: But even whether it comes up in the meeting --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. That's more of a DOT issue, so I would refer you to the Department of Transportation.\nQ: They're very concerned about it. Would he at least --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And I hope that that comes up.\nJeff Mason.\nQ: Just a follow-up on the DHS airline issue. If there is a danger to Americans or to fliers generally with having laptops or things that are bigger than a cellphone in planes from those 10 countries, why would that also not be a danger from other countries?\nMR. SPICER: As you can imagine, I can't talk about the intelligence that we have. I can just tell you that the steps that are being taken are appropriate and commensurate with the intelligence that we have. And I'd refer you to the Department of Homeland Security and, specifically, the Transportation Security Administration.\nQ: One other question.\nMR. SPICER: One out of two.\nQ: Okay. The President has traditionally issued a greeting to those celebrating the Iranian New Year, Nowruz. Will President Trump be doing that today?\nMR. SPICER: Let me get back to you. I know that -- I don't want to get ahead of myself on that, but we may have something for you later. I've got to check on that.\nBut thank you, guys, very much. Let's get back to watching Neil Gorsuch. And I will see you tomorrow. We're going to have a week full of briefings. I'm excited. And, by the way, I am very happy that the individual in the press corps who took Tom Brady's jersey -- (laughter) -- that that has been returned properly. Another bad on the press, but we have righted that wrong. Thank you.\nEND 2:41 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-21", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

For almost six decades, NASA's work has inspired millions and millions of Americans to imagine distant worlds and a better future right here on Earth. I'm delighted to sign this bill—it's been a long time since a bill like this has been signed—reaffirming our national commitment to the core mission of NASA: human space exploration, space science, and technology.\nWith this legislation, we support NASA's scientists, engineers, astronauts, and their pursuit of discovery. We support jobs; it's about jobs also. This bill calls for ongoing medical monitoring and treatment of our heroic astronauts for health conditions that result from their service. It's a pretty tough job. I don't know, Ted, would you like to do it? I don't think I would. [Laughter] Marco, do you want to do it? Marco, I don't know. I'm not sure we want to do it.\nSenator R. Edward \"Ted\" Cruz. You could send Congress to space. [Laughter]\nThe President. Hey! [Laughter] What a great idea. That could be—[laughter].\nThis bill will make sure that NASA's most important and effective programs are sustained. It orders NASA to continue—and it does, it orders just that—to continue transitioning activities to the commercial sector where we have seen great progress. It's amazing what's going on; so many people and so many companies are so into exactly what NASA stands for. So the commercial and the private sector will get to use these facilities. And I hope they're going to be paying us a lot of money, because they're going to make great progress.\nIt continues support for the commercial crew program, which will carry American astronauts into space from American soil once again—been a long time. It supports NASA's deep space exploration, including the Space Launch System and the ORION spacecraft. It advances space science by maintaining a balanced set of mission and activities to explore our solar system and the entire universe. And it ensures that through NASA's astronauts and aeronautics research, the United States will remain a total leader in aviation.\nNow, these astronauts are amazing—I've met some of them—they are very brave people, and their right at the forefront. So we salute them with this legislation. And we salute the ones that have lost their lives doing what they love to do.\nAmerica's space program has been a blessing to our people and to the entire world. Almost half a century ago, our brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the Moon. That was a big moment in our history. Now this Nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today we're taking the initial steps toward a bold and bright new future for American spaceflight.\nI am honored to sign this new bill. The folks behind me have been so involved in it. They love NASA. They love everything it stands for, and they love the people in their areas. You have a couple of areas that are going to be very benefit—very much benefited by this.\nSo I just want to thank all of the people standing behind me. They've done a great service for the country and for their communities. It's a lot of jobs, and these are great jobs. So thank you very much. And we'll sign this. [At this point, the President signed the bill.]\nThe President. Okay. So we'll hold that up. A lot of pages. Look at the pages in there. That's a lot of—[laughter].

Thank you very much. Does anybody have anything good to say? Ted, do you want to say something?\nSen. Cruz. Well, this is terrific: the first time in 7 years we've had a NASA authorization bill. Thank you, Mr. President, for signing it. This means a great deal to the President's—to the Nation's space exploration, it means a great deal to the State of Texas, and it continues America's leadership in space. So thank you for your leadership.\nThe President. Thank you, Teddy.\nMarco, please?\nSen. Rubio. I just think I'm happy to see that Florida is going to continue to more than Texas is in NASA, Mr. President. [Laughter]\nThe President. It's going to be a good competition.

[Laughter]\nRep. Culbertson. It's a special man who loves NASA.\nThe President. He does love NASA.\nSenator C. William Nelson. It puts us on the dual track. We have the commercial companies going to and from the International Space Station, and we have NASA going out and exploring the heavens. And we're going to Mars.\nThe President. Good. I love that. I love that.\nRep. Culbertson. Just as—Mr. President, if I may. Just as Americans remember that President Eisenhower was the father of the Interstate Highway System, with you bill signing today and you vision and leadership, future generations will remember that President Donald Trump was the father of the interplanetary highway system.\nThe President. Well, that sounds exciting. [Laughter] First, we want to fix our highways. We're going to fix our highways. Yes.\nRepresentative Brian Babbin. Mr. President, as House subcommittee chair, I'd like to—and actually part of the author of the new TREAT Act for our astronauts, that started in a meeting with astronaut Scott Kelly after he got back from nearly a year in space. And I said, what can we do for you in the House of Representatives? He said, take care of us. Make sure we're hanging on to this data so that future astronauts will be treated right, and we'll know what to do and make the proper adjustments for folks when they're up there in the ISS and on beyond. So I want to thank everybody here. I thank these astronauts who have put their lives on the line.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Mike?\nVice President Pence. I want to say—excuse me for a moment—on behalf of the President and all of us, I want to thank all these Members of Congress, these courageous astronauts for their work on this, but to assure you that, in very short order, the President will be taking action to relaunch the National Space Council. And he's asked me to chair that, as Vice Presidents have in the past. And we're going to be bringing together the best and brightest in NASA and also in the private sector.\nWe have elected a builder for President.

It continuously builds on its centuries of progress through advances in science, research, technology, safety, production, and marketing to meet the demands of changing consumer needs and complex world markets. The agriculture sector provides jobs across our Nation, not just for farmers and ranchers, but for foresters, scientists, processors, shippers, firefighters, police, and retailers.\nAmerican agriculture is the largest positive contributor to our Nation's net trade balance, generating 10 percent of our exports and millions of American jobs. America's farmers and ranchers provide a safe and plentiful domestic food supply, which is vital to our national security. Moreover, they safeguard our sustainable resource base for future generations. As my Administration fights for better trade deals, agriculture will be an important consideration so that its significant contributions will only increase in the years ahead.\nAmerican farmers and ranchers are the heart and soul of America and they represent the determined, self-reliant character of our Nation. We are proud of American agriculture and we recognize agriculture's critical role to our Nation's bright future.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

That's what it is, a disaster. Premiums have soared double digits and even triple digits. Insurance companies are fleeing. One-third of counties only have one Obamacare insurer left. I was in Tennessee 4 nights ago. They've lost half the State. The insurance companies are gone, and they're going to lose the next one pretty soon from what they say. And last night, in Kentucky, we had a tremendous crowd—25,000 people, more—and a similar crowd in Tennessee, by the way—packed, with thousands of people outside. They couldn't get them into these massive arenas; there's something going on that's really incredible in this country. It's really incredible.\nBut Kentucky also is having a tremendous problem, as you know and as you've read, with Obamacare. And many other States. The House bill ends the Obamacare nightmare and gives health care decisions back to the States and back to the American people.\nThese are the conservative solutions we campaigned on, and these are the conservative solutions the American people asked us as a group to deliver. We are keeping our promises. I go to these arenas, and they have signs all over the place: \"He's kept his promise.\" He's kept his promise. Because I've done a lot of work.\nThe border is in the best shape it's been in in decades, down 61 percent since Inauguration. General Kelly—you know, they used to put political people—I refuse to say political hacks, because I would not say that. Because there is no such thing as a political hack. But they would put nice political people at the border. I put General Kelly, recommended by General \"Mad Dog\" Mattis.\nI said to him, General—General Mattis—I said, General, I need somebody really smart and really tough for the border. \"Sir, I have the man, General Kelly.\" Soon as I saw him, it was, like—an interview lasted for about 30 seconds—I said, he's the right guy. And he's been great. And General Mattis has been great; you see what's going on. Big difference.\nIt's been 60 days since my Inauguration, and that was a promise that I've really kept.\nAs you saw today in the Senate, I nominated a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nI've taken historic action to eliminate unnecessary, job-killing regulations. And we've just started on that one. But we've gotten rid of a lot of them. That includes eliminating regulations crushing our coal industry. We're going to put our great coal miners back to work. Clean coal. Clean coal.\nI've cleared the way for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL Pipelines and added a requirement that American pipelines be constructed with American steel. Like, that was the last minute. I said, where are we getting the steel? I won't tell you where, but you can guess. I said, from now on we have to go—you've got to build them here. You want to put pipelines under our land, you're going to make the pipe in this country.\nAnd one other thing happened. I have to tell you, it's sort of interesting. So I get a call from the ex-president of Goldman Sachs who now works for us, Gary Cohn. I said to him, Gary, let me ask you, I heard there was a lawsuit. I hear the pipeline company is suing us. I said, how much? Fourteen billion dollars. I said, wait a minute. I'm approving a pipeline, and they're suing us for $14 billion, and I've already approved it, right? I said, I just heard it. Go back to them and tell them if they don't drop the suit immediately, we are going to terminate the deal. You have great—you know, being President gives you great power, right? [Laughter] Amazing. So I just saw him this morning. I said, by the way, how did you do? He said, sir, they dropped the suit. Good. That's good. [Applause] Right?\nIsn't that easier? Look, if I'm a—do you think Hillary does that? I don't think so. I don't think so. Isn't that easier, though, than settling for, like, $4 billion in 7 years from now? Oh, but the lawyers aren't happy at all. They don't like it. [Laughter] You've got a lot of lawyers in this crowd; they're not happy about that deal. [Laughter]\nBecause of the new business climate that we're creating, jobs are already starting to pour back in. Companies like Sprint, Intel, Exxon-Mobile—where a great man, Rex Tillerson, is doing an incredible job—[applause]—ran that company for many years and ran it well. Walmart, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors have all announced that they're keeping or adding tens of thousands of jobs right here in America. It's a big difference. You used to hear they're all leaving. Now they're all coming back. They're coming back too, believe me. If they don't, we're taxing the hell out of their product, so you know they're coming back. [Laughter]\nWhy didn't somebody start doing that 25 years ago? One company said, sir, we're building a big plant; there's nothing we can do to stop it. It's already under construction. I said, here's the story: When you make your cars or whatever, and you fire all our American employees, and then you think in your new plant—beautiful new plant, congratulations—you're going to sell that product across our border, tax free, you're wrong—35 percent tax. It's amazing how quickly they say, you know, I think we've decided to stay in the United States. I only wonder, why didn't somebody do this, like, 25 years ago? You would have had nobody leaving. So far, I think I'm batting about a hundred percent.\nTo save taxpayer dollars, I've already begun negotiating better contracts for the Federal Government, saving over $700 million on just one set of airplanes of which there are many sets.\nAs I promised during the campaign, I have proposed a budget that eliminates the defense sequester and fully rebuilds the United States military. We need it more than ever. We need it more than ever. We've got a lot of haters out there; they hate. We've got some people running some countries that are bad people. We will take care of it. [Laughter] We will ensure that the America warrior—and if you think about it, the great American warriors—because that's what they are—are given the tools, the funding, the resources, the training, and equipment they so richly deserve. They are warriors, and they have old equipment. They're not going to have old equipment much longer.\nAnd we will take care of our great veterans. What's happening there is going to be incredible. Finally, we're going to take care of our veterans. Our defense expansion will fully pay—and this will be something that is so important—it will be fully paid by making government leaner, more accountable, and just perfect for our people. But I will tell you, if it's not fully paid—because we're doing a big number, with the planes and the ships—our Navy is at World War I levels. Can you believe that? World War I levels. So if we don't fully pay, we're going to do a little work, but we're going to get our military rebuilt—bigger and better and stronger than ever—because we have no choice, folks. There's some bad players out there. And it's going to go quickly.\nI have also followed through on my promise to secure, protect, and defend the borders of the United States, and, yes, we will build a great border wall at our southern border. Will be built. These security actions will save billions of dollars, millions of jobs, and thousands and thousands of lives. We're also taking decisive action to improve our vetting procedures. The courts are not helping us, I have to be honest with you. It's ridiculous. Somebody said I should not criticize judges. Okay, I'll criticize judges. [Laughter] To keep criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country. [Laughter]\nWe are keeping these promises, and many, many more. After we repeal and replace Obamacare, our Republican majority will pass massive, historic tax reform, the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and potentially even bigger. It's going to be very big. And by the way, we had to go—had no choice—had to go with the health care first. You know how it works. This is one room that really does know how it works. [Laughter] But we had to go with the health care first. And we're doing well. I think we're going to have some great surprises. I hope that it's going to all work out.\nThen, we immediately start on the tax cuts, and they're going to be really fantastic, and I am looking forward to that one. That one is going to be fun. [Laughter] That one is going to be fun. That's called the wheelhouse. [Laughter] We're going to do a great job for companies. We're going to bring back—could be $3 to $5 trillion from overseas, money that can't be brought back. That's part of our taxes.\nAnd it will lower the business tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive anywhere in the world, way, way down. We will do everything we can to lower business burdens and to make it easier for our businesses to thrive and compete. But in exchange, they must hire, invest, and grow in America, or we're not giving them anything, okay? They've got to do that. That's the one thing.\nWe're working with the automobile industry who have been played around with. And I'm saying, we'll do things for you, but you've got to build new plants all over the place. You're going to build new plants in our country. And they're doing it; they're starting. It's going to be amazing.\nI have called this model—the model that you've been watching, the model that's created so much value, the model of bringing back jobs and bringing back industry—I called it the American model. And this is the system that our Founders wanted. Our greatest American leaders—including George Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Lincoln—they all agreed that for America to be a strong nation, it must also be a great manufacturing nation. Have to make money.\nThe Republican platform of 1896—more than a century ago—stated that: \"Protection and reciprocity are twin measures of American policy and go hand in hand.\" I mean, we have situations where other countries who have zero respect for our country—by the way, did you notice they're starting to respect us a lot? A lot. A lot. They'll charge us a hundred-percent tax on some counts. A hundred percent. And we charge them nothing. They'll make it impossible through regulations for our product to be sold in their country, and yet they'll sell their product routinely in our country. Not going to happen anymore. The word \"reciprocity\"—they do it, we do it. Who can complain about that? Big difference. You're talking about big, big dollars too, by the way.\nThe platform went on to say: \"We renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence and the foundation of American development and prosperity.\"\nNow, these were some of our greatest leaders, some of whom were great businesspeople. They understood we have to do it. And just so you understand, I'm a free trader, but free trade has been very unfair trade. So I now say I'm a fair trader. And I want to trade all over the world. I don't want to have it just here. But we're going to be beneficiaries from now on. We're not going to be the people that are taken advantage of any longer. That's been happening for decades and decades, not going to happen any longer. And they know it.\nOne country came in to see me recently: big country, good country, great person. One of his first questions, sir, how much will you be charging us? [Laughter] It's like he knew. He knew. [Laughter] He knew. They've been ripping us for years, and he finally saw somebody that understands—so it's one of those things. [Laughter] You don't mind having a rich nation again and having lower taxes, do you? Does anybody here mind? If anybody minds, please stand up. I know Dick Cheney will not stand on this one. [Laughter] Please stand up.\nAs long as the GOP stands for \"Made in the U.S.A.\"—remember in the old days, cars all said, \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" right? We don't have that too much anymore. We're going to have it again soon. I'm telling all the car companies, put a big label, \"Made in the U.S.A.\"—it's going to stand for quality. Our party will have a very, very bright future.\nIt is fitting that we are in the National Building Museum. Since its founding, the Republican Party has been a party of builders. Many of the great builders are in this audience tonight. Some of them I have to compete with, and I really—actually, I don't like very many of them. But you know—[laughter]. Some of them I do. Some of them I truly dislike a lot. [Laughter] But now I like everybody. I like all the great builders. See, and now it's different. [Laughter] Now we're all on the same side, so I like—see the guy over there? I couldn't stand that guy for years. He did a good job, but I couldn't stand him. Now I like you. [Laughter]\nOur first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, ran his first campaign for public office in 1832, when he was only 23 years old. He began by imagining the benefits a railroad could bring to his port [part; White House correction.] of Illinois, without ever having seen a steam-powered train. He had no idea, and yet he knew what it could be. Thirty years later, as President, Lincoln signed the law that built the first transcontinental railroad, uniting our country from ocean to ocean. Great President. Most people don't even know he was a Republican, right? Does anyone know? Lot of people don't know that. We have to build that up a little bit more. Let's take an ad; let's use one of those PACs. [Laughter] Those PACs, you never know what the hell is going to come out of those PACs. [Laughter] You think they're friendly—although the best ad I ever had was one done against me by Hillary; it was so good, I said I hope that she keeps running that ad. [Laughter]\nAnother great Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, had a vision of a national infrastructure plan. As an officer in the Army after World War I, he joined a military convoy that trekked across the Nation to the Pacific Coast. It traveled along the Lincoln Highway—called then the Lincoln Highway. Its journey began by the South Lawn of the White House, at a monument known today as Zero Milestone. Anybody know where that is? The journey made a great impression on then-young Eisenhower. More than three decades later, as President, he signed the bill that created our great Interstate Highway System, once again uniting us as a nation.\nNow is time for a new Republican administration, working with our Republican Congress, to pass the next great infrastructure bill. Our party must dream as big and as bold as Lincoln and Eisenhower. Together, Republicans will lead America into our unbelievable future. We have so much potential. We have so much potential. I see it now even more than I saw it in this great campaign, which turned out to be a movement, a movement like the world has never seen before, actually.\nYou know, it's funny, I've said that so often, they don't even correct me, you know, the fake media. [Laughter] They never correct me, because it's true. Oh, believe me, if it's off by one-hundredth of a percent, it's, like, I end up getting Pinocchios, right? They don't even correct me. One of the great movements of all time. Imagine—and it's not my movement. It's a movement of the people. It's been something that's really been very special. I'm like a messenger. I'm nothing more than a messenger. I'm a messenger. I did a good job as a messenger, but I'm a messenger. [Laughter] It's been a lot of fun too.\nImagine the breakthroughs that will breathe fresh life into forgotten places. Picture the new roads that will carve pathways all across our land. And we need them. And think of the new inventions that will lift up the sights of our Nation.\nFinally, as we imagine this new prosperity at home, let us also work to achieve real and enduring peace abroad. People don't realize, I have to say, what a mess we inherited. What we have—I'm telling you, you look at North Korea. You look at the Middle East. You look all over. You look at that horrible, horrible, horrible Iran deal. I still have not been able to figure out why anybody would have signed that deal. I asked generals—I have them in my office—I say, General, please tell me, why did they sign that deal? Unbelievable. But we're going to straighten things out, folks.\nThe best Republican Presidents have not only been warfighters, but also peacemakers. We will never hesitate to do what we must to keep us safe today, but we will always seek a more peaceful tomorrow. We will, and we will succeed.\nIf we stand for these things—safety, prosperity, and peace—then there is no limit to what we can achieve: a future where millions are lifted from welfare to work. And they're going to love it. They're going to love it. They're going to love waking up in the morning, going to work; communities thriving with jobs and surging with commerce; inner cities filled with new hope and new opportunity; schools where our children can learn free from violence and free from fear; and new frontiers in science, technology, and space that inspire the next generation of American youth.\nAll of this, and so much more, is possible. Our country is great. A new national pride is stirring our souls. A new optimism is sweeping our land. A new era of American greatness is just beginning.\nSomewhere in America tonight, a child is born in poverty, looking up into the sky, and filling their heart with dreams, big, beautiful, bold dreams. And if we make the right choices together, then no one will ever have to tell that child that their dreams will have to wait for another day, another year, or another decade. Because the waiting now is over. The time for action is now. This is the moment when great deeds are done, and we will do those great deeds. By putting our faith in the people, and by putting our trust in God, we will rise to this occasion like no one has ever risen before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you so much. Thank you. Great people, great country. Thank you so much.\nWe will prove worthy of this moment. Anything is possible if we stand together, united and strong, not just as Republicans, but as great and unified Americans. Join me in believing in this better and brighter future, join me in building this reality, and join me in rededicating ourselves to the common good of this Nation that we all love so much. Together, we will defend our freedoms, we will defend our people, and we will defend our great and beautiful American flag.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-21", "title": "Remarks at a National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123568", "text": "James S. Brady Briefing Room\n1:41 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First, at the top, I wanted to note that the President has been briefed on the situation in London. He just spoke to Prime Minister May, and we'll have a readout on that situation and that call soon.\nWe obviously condemn today's attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism. And we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation. The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers.\nThe City of London and Her Majesty's government have the full support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible. We will provide you with further updates as warranted and, as I mentioned, a readout of the President's call with the Prime Minister.\nTurning to the events of today -- this morning, the President received his daily intelligence briefing. He stopped by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems Administrator, Seema Verma. And also, that event was attended by the Vice President and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price.\nHealthcare professionals have seen the challenges of implementing Obamacare firsthand. They're a valuable asset to the President and his team as we continue to consider and enact policies, like the American Health Care Act, that will make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.\nThe women who were at the roundtable today represent the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and administrators who make sure that people around the country receive the necessary preventative and lifesaving care that they need every day.\nThe doctors who attend to the patients in the family practices, emergency rooms, and clinics -- and those who support them on the administrative and technical sides -- are one of our country's most treasured resources.\nWith the passage of the American Health Care Act and the rest of the President's healthcare reform agenda, everyone, regardless of their financial situation, will be able to take full advantage of this resource.\nThat's why, at last count, over 40 major associations have expressed their support for the American Health Care Act, with several of them, including the U.S. Chamber [of Commerce], the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and, just today, the National Taxpayers Union calling it a key vote.\nFollowing his appearance at the panel, the President and his legislative affairs team hosted several members of the House of Representatives for another meeting on the American Health Care Act. The President acknowledged, as he has before, that the AHCA is only one step in the larger process of fixing the broken healthcare system created by Obamacare, but it's an essential first step.\nUndoing and fixing all of the misguided policies is going to require a holistic, multistep process. And that's why the President and his team are fully committed to maintaining an open line of communication with Capitol Hill leadership throughout this entire process.\nThroughout the weeks since the AHCA was first introduced, they have been meeting with Republican members from across the political spectrum, many of whom we've seen move from \"no\" to \"yes,\" as they learn more about the legislation and amendments that have been adopted. Continued coordination between administrative and legislative actions will ensure that our new healthcare system is effective and efficient.\nThis afternoon, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus's Executive Committee. The President has brought in and will continue to hear from representatives of all interests as he continues to note that he is the President of all Americans. Diversity makes our nation strong, and it also means that we don't necessarily agree on every policy item but that we continue to have a dialogue towards productive policies that help America move forward.\nThe President looks forward to discussing the CBC's policy priorities and finding ways that they can work together where those priorities align.\nThis evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary of State Tillerson. Today at the State Department, Secretary Tillerson hosted the foreign ministers and senior leaders of the Global Coalition working to defeat ISIS for the first meeting of the full coalition of 68 members since December 2014. This meeting follows up on the defense ministerial Secretary Mattis hosted last month in Brussels.\nThe coalition is united in the fight against ISIS, and this meeting seeks to accelerate international efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it holds in Iraq and Syria, while maximizing pressure on its branches, affiliates, and networks.\nThis meeting is a part of our whole-of-government approach to defeating ISIS. The Trump administration will use all of the tools of national power, in coordination with our international powers [partners], to cut off ISIS's funding, expand intelligence sharing, and deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens.\nAlso today, over on the Hill, Judge Gorsuch [is] in his second day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his nearly 12 hours of questioning yesterday -- now at least I know how someone else feels -- (laughter) -- the judge continued to prove himself an enormously qualified jurist that Americans will all be proud to see on the Supreme Court. It's not surprising that Senate Democrats are failing to gain traction for any of their potshots and opposition to Judge Gorsuch. There's simply not enough politicizing the Senate Democrats can do to hide the fact that Judge Gorsuch is an immensely qualified and thoughtful jurist with a lifelong dedication to our Constitution.\nA few administrative notes here before I take your questions: Last night, we formally announced that the President will travel to Brussels for the May 25th meeting of NATO heads of state and government. During this meeting, the President looks forward to reaffirming our strong commitment to NATO and discussing critical issues to the Alliance, especially Allied responsibility-sharing and NATO's role against -- the fight against terrorism.\nThe President will also host NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to the White House on April 12th.\nToday, the President declared a major disaster exists in the state of Wyoming and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in February.\nWe also announced that the President will deliver this year's commencement address at Liberty University on May 13th.\nThe President is proud to call Liberty's president, Jerry Falwell, his wife Becki and their entire family, his friends, and looks forward to celebrating the success of this amazing graduating class on such a momentous occasion.\nFinally, a few minutes ago, many of you may have seen that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, gave remarks on the surveillance collected on individuals associated with the President. Let me quote him directly:\n\"I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in the intelligence community reporting. And third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or [of] the Trump team.\"\nMy understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming to the White House later to brief the President on this development, and we will have a readout for that meeting once it occurs.\nWith that, I'll be glad to take your questions. Mara.\nQ: Two questions. One on Nunes and then healthcare. Is your understanding that this -- none of these unmasked names were leaked?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I literally read the statement -- or heard the statement, came out and briefed it. It was wrapping up as we were beginning this.\nQ: Okay. Today in the pool spray, the President said \"keep your doctor, keep your plan\" didn't work out that way. You didn't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. This is one of the reasons we have to repeal Obamacare.\nIs the President assuring people who currently like their plan or like their doctor that under the American Health Care Act they can keep their doctor and their plan?\nMR. SPICER: Well, that's the hope. And what I mean by that is not to be cute, but last time they were promised something that didn't turn out. I can't promise something that a doctor stays in a plan or a plan stays there. But that's a bit different.\nWe understand that we're letting market forces come into play here. Competition. Doctors can change what insurances they take. Plans can come in and out of markets.\nWhat I think we can be assured of is a couple of things. One is that currently under Obamacare, premiums are set to continue to skyrocket. We've seen an average of 25 percent. We've noted before in Arizona, they've gone up 116 percent. I think there's no question that the additional competition and amendments that have been brought into this discussion will help lower the trajectory of that, number one.\nNumber two is I think that they're going to see greater choice. So I think those are the things that we're willing to talk about being part of this plan because you can't -- where they erred last time is went out and made promises that they couldn't keep. And I think that one of the problems that they did is that they've tried to suppress market forces and competition. And instead of lowering costs and increasing choice, which is what they sought to do, it did the opposite. So that's where this is headed, and I think that's important.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. On the AHCA, Mark Meadows, who appears to be a firm no in terms of his opposition to the replacement bill, said that 25 members of the Freedom Caucus are opposed to this replacement bill. Do you dispute those numbers?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to share our whip count. I know we saw Lou Barletta, who was a hard no, come out and say he's yes. Steve King I believe had been a no; he's a yes. Member by member we're seeing tremendous support flow in our direction, and the count keeps getting stronger for us. So I'm not going to start to get into yes or nos. But I would just say that former Congressman Mulvaney, now Director of OMB Mulvaney, who is a leader in that caucus, has been a very strong advocate of this policy. As you know, he's been up on the Hill talking to his former colleagues, assuring them of the effort and why the process has to go the way it does.\nBut I'm optimistic in the sense of what we're seeing and the trajectory that this is going, and the number of votes that are flowing our way, not the other way.\nQ: And on the confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch, I have not seen any Democrat come out in support of Judge Gorsuch just yet. Do you anticipate that you'll get Democratic support on this particular nomination?\nMR. SPICER: I hope and believe so. I think that there have been several that have been spoken very positively. I think he's been extremely impressive throughout this confirmation process, and you've heard members both in the Senate, on the committee, and then a lot of outside voices comment on how well he's done, how qualified he is. And I think it's tough for anybody to say that he's not immensely qualified for this position.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, related to Congressman Nunes, can you explain why the White House has agreed to meet with him at all about what his findings are? And the reason I ask that is because the minute that Director Comey said that there was an official investigate, it might appear as if the White House is interfering with the investigation. And Congressman Nunes should present his information not to the White House but to the FBI. So why is anyone here at the White House agreeing to meet with him about his findings?\nMR. SPICER: We'll have a readout for you after that meeting. I think he did this press conference. He made the announcement that he was coming up to see the President to share these findings. I don't know who else he's shared them with. I don't know -- to your question, I don't know if he's briefed anyone else on it in terms of the intelligence community -- either Admiral Rogers or Comey -- of whether this is something they shared with him.\nBut I think after the meeting, hopefully depending on the classification level, we may be able to share more on that with you.\nQ: Can I just add, is the President concerned at all that there will be an appearance immediately, today that he has interfered with an ongoing investigation -- whether it's a congressional investigation or the executive branch investigation by meeting privately with a congressman who says he has information?\nMR. SPICER: So let me get this straight. Number one, we asked -- as you know, two weeks ago, we said this was the appropriate venue.\nNumber two, you guys have asked us over and over again, why aren't we meeting with certain individuals. The chairman of the committee that -- one of the two committees that we asked to look into this -- wants to share his findings, or what he knows. I think that is exactly how we've talked about this working. But I would leave it to Congressman Nunes to come up, and to brief and share his thoughts. I don't know what his plan is. Obviously, he sat -- he briefed the media before he briefed us. He went down and talked about what he had found.\nSo, you know, it's interesting, I didn't see any complaints from you guys when he went down and held a press conference for the umpteenth time talking about his findings and what he's found. There is no complaints from the media when he shares what he has found with you guys. But when he wants to come up here and tell us, this is where the investigation stands and here's what I've unloaded -- or excuse me, learned -- there's seems to be a little bit of an interesting double standard on that.\nQ: Just to close the loop, because the President said that he had additional information that he believed the White House or he or his representatives would present, related to this investigation, what Congressman Nunes has is not related to that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- you're asking me questions that -- he has not briefed us. He has not briefed the President. You guys, as I noted -- he actually went down and spoke to the media before he shared this with us.\nSo I would ask the colleagues that of yours that ask questions, more than you have -- you've had -- collectively, the media has more of an opportunity to ask questions and to hear what he has to say than we do at this point. So once we have more to understand what he said, to the extent that we can, I'm sure we'll be glad to share it with you. But the media has more information than we do at this point.\nJon.\nQ: Sean, staying on that, didn't we already know that there was incidental collection of intelligence involving some members of the transition team? And I point to --\nMR. SPICER: Not the way you guys ask the questions. I mean, you questioned us every day about what we knew, and now you're coming back to me saying, didn't we already know this. Well -- I'm doing somewhat of an effective job.\nQ: No, but didn't we already know that Flynn was monitored in his conversations with Kislyak?\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: So we know --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I guess my point, John, is I don't know. He made a statement, went down to the press. Until we get briefed on this, until the President gets briefed, I don't know what he knows. And so to ask -- until that occurs, and until we have the ability to share some of that in an unclassified nature, I don't want to get ahead of it. I don't know what he knows. That's why, apparently, he's coming up to share his findings with the President. At least that's what he said. Again, let's wait and see how this unfolds.\nQ: And on the American Health Care Act, Mark Meadows says they don't have the votes, they need to start over and do a new bill. That sounds like you're in pretty serious trouble.\nMR. SPICER: No, that sounds like one member's opinion. As I mentioned --\nQ: Who represents a large contingent of people who oppose the bill.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, but again, I just named a few of the members that are part of that caucus that have come on board. I think that -- look, every day, you see more and more of those members from that caucus and throughout the entire conference express their support for the bill. The President was up yesterday for a while talking to them.\nWe've had members -- and the Vice President has been actively engaged -- Mick Mulvaney, Reince Priebus, Marc Short and Rick Dearborn, who lead our leg affairs team. These guys have been flooding the Hill. They've been on the phone, having meetings with them. There's been a series of members up here all day. I think the trajectory is going very well for us.\nQ: And Heritage Action says you can easily fix this bill simply by removing the regulatory framework -- the tax credits and all of that -- and you'll get massive buy-in from conservatives. But can you do that?\nMR. SPICER: There are certain constraints that we have in the reconciliation process. And for those who are steeped in the arcane rules of the Senate, there's a thing called the Byrd Rule, and it does not allow policy to be recreated. It has to do with the budgetary nature of that vehicle to get -- that's sustainable at 50 votes. Right now, there are certain things that I think a lot of people would like but that will not potentially get ruled in order by the Senate parliamentarian.\nSo I understand what people want, but I think that we have created a vehicle to get this done. This is the only way that we will repeal and replace Obamacare. And again, I think people have to recognize that there is a three-step process to doing this. This is exactly how the Democrats enacted it, and this is exactly how we will unwind it and implement a much better system. That's it, plain and simple.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, I know you can't get ahead of Nunes, but what he said was, incidental, legal surveillance using a FISA warrant, which would --\nMR. SPICER: I don't believe he said FISA warrant.\nQ: He did.\nMR. SPICER: Did he? Okay.\nQ: He did. And that's why I'm asking this question, which is, does the Trump administration have the presumption that foreign leaders or foreign nationals will not be surveilled when they are in contact with --\nMR. SPICER: No, look, again, as I said, I don't want to start talking or guessing what he may say or may not say, or explain this. I think that we will have more information, or I hope to have more information once the President is briefed, and to find out what else has gone on in terms of additional information on this. But I do think it is a startling revelation and there's a lot of questions that need to get asked. I think it's interesting all of the questions are in the presumptive negative towards us, as opposed to \"why was this taking place, why were people surveilled ostensibly; they were involved in the campaign.\" Because it's not --\nQ: Well, that's why I'm trying to clarify that --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, the question is -- the question --\nQ: -- was your presumption that foreign nationals --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, it's not a presumption. Actually, I'm not the one --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Right. Respectfully, I'm not the one with the presumption -- you guys are. I didn't come up here presuming anything. I actually started my comments off by saying that --\nQ: Well, I would presume that foreign nationals are being monitored by U.S. intelligence when they are talking to anyone.\nMR. SPICER: And then the question -- I think there's a series of questions, which is, how many times was an individual picked up? Why were they picked up? Were they unmasked? Again, a lot of this, if they're picked up during a FISA warrant, is that American citizens are prohibited by law from being unmasked, from \"having their name put out there.\" Why would someone's name get put out there? What ways were they described? There's a lot of questions that need to get asked. Those are the relevant issues that need to get asked. How many times was one individual followed? Did their name get unmasked, and why? But there's a lot of things that need to get followed up on. We're not at that position yet, as I've said now multiple times. The Chairman is going to come up here, brief the President, I don't know to what extent and to what detail. But hopefully, as we move forward, we will have more.\nQ: Is this what you've been -- because you've said there's more information to come, more information to come. Is this what you've been gesturing towards?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. For the eighth time, there is no -- we don't know what he's going to come up here and explain and share. And until that happens, for me to talk about where we think this is headed -- again, we're not in the business of trying to get to this point yet. We say, this is what they have. We've asked that the investigation be conducted and that people gather up information. What they have and to what extent, we'll know soon.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, I have a series of questions on a topic. Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, met with an official here at the White House yesterday. She's looking for fairness and justice in her son's case. What should we expect to come out of that meeting with this White House official? Should there be a push to make sure that there is an indictment of the police officer's --\nMR. SPICER: I mean, that's a Department of Justice question. For us to get involved in a case, a specific case, would be highly inappropriate in terms of trying to guess what the outcome of a case should be.\nQ: Well, along that line, the official, according to Ms. Carr, reached out to the Department of Justice, the civil rights division, had the wrong number; called another department, had the right number. Now, in previous administrations, to include the Obama administration and other administrations, the Department of Justice had limited the numbers of people to call over to the Department of Justice. Has the Attorney General, this Attorney General Sessions, changed that memo? What has he done?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it would have to be reissued. That's a separate issue in terms of -- every Attorney General issues a memo going back to, I think, Mukasey was the first one -- post-Watergate -- I'm trying to remember who issued the first one. But it has been a practice of I think almost every Attorney General to issue a memo spelling out the procedures that officials in the Justice Department contact the White House and who they can contact, and the nature of which and what their exceptions are, et cetera. Those memos get crafted by each administration, by each new Attorney General.\nI would refer you back to the Department of Justice on the status of that under this Attorney General.\nQ: So how many officials here have that right, to call the Department of Justice, even if it's for --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer. I would refer you to the Department of Justice.\nQ: But was there wrongdoing in this effort to call over to the Department of Justice?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I don't know the nature of -- I'll have to look into what you're asking. But I would, again, refer you back to the Department of Justice.\nHunter.\nQ: Yes. Thank you, Sean. I have two quick questions. Last November, President Trump dismissed reports he was trying to obtain security clearances for his children as \"a typically false news story.\" Now there are reports Ivanka Trump is indeed attempting to obtain a clearance. What changed there?\nMR. SPICER: Well, at the time, it was not true. I mean, she wasn't obtaining a security clearance, so it was not accurate then. There was no -- I think we addressed it during the transition. An official had actually just inquired. There was no actual attempt at the time. The official in question was removed from the transition team. They had merely made an inquiry into what it would take to get an SF-86 process moving forward. No paperwork was ever drawn, no account was opened, and that official was let go.\nAt this time, as I mentioned yesterday, Ivanka has decided to go above and beyond, and act in certain ways to ensure that she complies with certain rules by maintaining the Federal Records Act, getting a security clearance so that if she is privy to any information that is classified, she has to abide by the same rules and regulations in terms of being in a room and how it's handled, et cetera. We have taken appropriate measures to do that. I mentioned the statement yesterday and will stick by it.\nQ: And then the second question on Paul Manafort. The Associated Press has published a report based on documents that he had a plan to \"benefit\" Vladimir Putin for a client. And with him back in the headlines, I'm just wondering if you still stand by the comment that he had a \"limited role\" on the campaign. And if you could explain a little bit more about how spending months as the campaign's top official is a limited role.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. I've tried to avoid commenting. I know I've talked to a lot of you about the individual stories, but I think obviously this one has started to catch a lot of buzz. So to comment briefly on this, I think nothing in this morning's report referenced any actions by the President, the White House, or any Trump administration official. I think that's got to be clear from the get-go.\nThe report is entirely focused on actions that Paul took a decade ago regarding -- he's a former advisor of the campaign, and the actions that came to light this morning are about a client that he had last decade.\nI know I commented on this the other day, and clearly I should have been more precise with respect to Paul's role. So let me clarify this and kind of go through the facts. Paul was hired to oversee the campaign's delegate operation. He had played a significant role in the convention and delegate operations of four previous Republican nominees -- Bob Dole, former Presidents George H. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. And to be clear, he got the job done on the delegates. The President won the Republican nomination after months of speculation after a potentially contested contest -- convention.\nIn total, he was involved with the campaign for a total of just under five months. He was first hired on March 28th to oversee delegate operations. He was made the chief strategist and campaign chairman on May 19th. And his relationship with the campaign ended on August 19th.\nThe AP story focuses on his activities from the last decade. And to place in to context, Paul represented many foreign clients, according to publicly available data, in the Caribbean, Asia, Africa and Europe. His representation of foreign clients is public and similar to the work of Tony Podesta, a Clinton campaign fundraiser, whose brother John chaired Hillary Clinton's campaign.\nLast year -- not last decade -- Tony Podesta lobbied against sanctions for Russia's largest bank. And John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, sat on the board of a Russian-based energy company. This was something tied to Hillary Clinton, who was the face of the failed Russia reset policy. So it's not even close -- what we're talking about now isn't even close to her most significant role with respect to Russia.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, along with the Obama administration, approved a deal that gave Russia one-fifth of America's uranium reserves. Hillary's husband, former President Bill Clinton, received over half a million dollars by a paid speech by a bank connected to the uranium deal. And Vladimir Putin personally called the former President and thanked him for giving the speech.\nSo an individual who worked for less than -- the campaign for five months for the President's two-year long campaign, who worked with a Russian entity a decade ago, is the subject of rampant media speculation all day long, even though the Clintons had much more expensive -- extensive ties, while Secretary of State Hillary was crafting a policy she said was designed \"strengthen Russia.\"\nAnd to be clear, the President has no personal financial dealings with Russia. His ties are limited to hosting a contest in Russia once, and selling a Palm Beach home to a businessman in 2005. That's it.\nAnd for members of the media trying to conflate Paul's role in activities with Monday's hearing, I have another reminder: Numerous individuals, including former Obama Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and acting CIA Director Mike Morrell and members of the intelligence community from both parties who have been briefed have said across the board that they have seen zero evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. And that's not going to be changed by former business dealings of a campaign staffer from a decade ago.\nSara.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You and other senior administration officials have sought to assure skeptical Republican lawmakers that phase two of these regulatory modifications will address some of their concerns. So what is Secretary Tom Price waiting for? Why not roll out phase two now if the vote is looking like it's going to be a very close marker?\nMR. SPICER: I think in some of those cases -- and it's tied to -- it's all one package, and that's why I think you saw some of the stuff he is working on, some of the stuff he is doing. But I think the important piece is to get the phase-one part of it done. He has assured them and talked to them about different administrative actions.\nAgain, part of this is sequencing. I mean, the same way that in Obamacare they didn't just have Kathleen Sebelius then go out and start implementing things. They passed the bill first through the reconciliation process, got that done, and then she did the administrative piece. We're doing the same process because of how some of the sequencing has to occur. And then the same thing on the legislative front, we've introduced in the House -- all those pieces of legislation have been done. Leader McCarthy has started to talk about the, that do all of the prong -- three steps.\nSo a lot of it is coming together, but part of it is, is a sequencing aspect that needs to get taken care of. But we are moving in the right direction.\nCan I go to John (inaudible) for the first question on Skype?\nQ: Yes. Good afternoon, Sean, from (inaudible) in Newport. Sean, you have a lot of members of the media saying that President Trump -- the President to all the people. What does the President say -- (inaudible)? Yesterday, you had (inaudible) White House grandstanding at the confirmation hearing. We've had Elizabeth Warren (inaudible), the Boston Globe condemning the (inaudible). You had Rhode Island Governor, Gina Raimondo, boycott. You had (inaudible) while she fundraised around the country. What's the President saying to frustrated Trump supporters who don't feel they're getting proper representation (inaudible) and in Congress?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think with respect to Judge Gorsuch, which is I think -- pretty clear that's where you're headed on this --\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. I just -- I mean, when you look at the praise, I mean, obviously I would love for it to be universal. And while we've gotten bipartisan praise from pundits and former law clerks in both parties, high number of jurists and former people -- legal scholars, members of Congress, we're not going to win everybody. And I think that Democrats have tried to score some points on the committee. They've largely fallen by the wayside. And we've seen very high praise for him.\nSo I would just suggest that anybody who's got a problem with him, I'd love to hear it, because so far most of the issues -- no one seems to have a problem with his academic credentials, his record or anything else. So I'm pretty buoyed by a lot of what we've seen come out of Capitol Hill with respect to him.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, thanks. Do you take the House Freedom Caucus at their word, Mark Meadows at their word? There are at least two dozen or so who are \"nos.\" So how do you get from this point right now policy-wise to tomorrow -- something, anything that maybe might flip that?\nMR. SPICER: I think we're doing it. I mean, piece by piece, member by member, we're getting there, and we're getting much closer. The last couple days we've continued to do that. But then today alone, I mentioned a couple of the other members. Slowly but surely we're getting there, and I feel confident that when the vote comes up, we'll have the votes.\nQ: And let me ask you today, Patrick McHenry, congressman, deputy whip, described the President, as members of Congress were coming in here to the White House, as the \"closer.\" Do you embrace that label?\nMR. SPICER: He is the closer.\nQ: Do you embrace that label here as it relates to healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. Ayesha.\nQ: You just said that you're confident that the healthcare bill will pass tomorrow. I want to get a sense of how confident you are. I don't know if you want to rate your percentage on it. Like, how confident are you that the bill will pass? And if it doesn't pass, is there a plan B?\nMR. SPICER: No, there is no plan B. There's plan A and plan A. We're going to get this done.\nQ: And so you're confident -- 100 percent confident?\nMR. SPICER: We're going to get it done. That's it -- plain and simple.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I know you said you didn't know what information you were going to find out today from Chairman Nunes, but my question for you is, when did the President know about this surveillance that the Congressman brought up today on Capitol Hill? He spoke late last week about -- we'll find out more information that would support these wiretapping claims. Is this the information he was talking about?\nMR. SPICER: Until Chairman Nunes briefs him, we don't know what he knows versus what the President has been made aware of. And so how that jives, I don't know. I hope to have more for you later.\nQ: And a quick follow-up on healthcare and just a quick follow-up on Asia. Does the President believe the healthcare bill will pass the House tomorrow?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nJonathan.\nQ: Two questions on Paul Manafort. Did the President know that he had worked to advance Putin's interests previous to becoming the campaign chairman?\nMR. SPICER: No, the President was not aware of Paul's clients from last decade. No.\nQ: But is that a problem? You know, now that all this is coming out and there is a whole lot scrutiny --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, but what is coming up? What else don't we know? I mean, where he went to school, what grades he got, who played he played with in the sandbox?\nQ: Well, you didn't know that Michael Flynn was --\nMR. SPICER: Okay, I -- thanks, Peter. I'm answering a question --\nQ: We're all part of the conversation.\nMR. SPICER: No, you're not, actually.\nThe answer to your question is, I think to talk about someone having a client from 10 years ago that had a consulting company with clients from around the world --\nQ: He paid millions of dollars to advance Putin's interests. I mean, that's enough --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't know what he got paid to. If you listen to what Paul --\nQ: The documents said --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. I understand. I'm going to answer your question, if you give me a second. That he was a consultant, he had clients from around the world. There is no suggestion that he did anything improper. But to suggest that that President knew who his clients were from a decade ago is a bit insane. There is not -- he was not a government employee. He didn't fill out any paperwork attesting to something. There is nothing that he did that suggests, at this point, that anything was nefarious. He was hired to do a job; he did it. That's it -- plain and simple.\nQ: I'm just saying, given that it was such a focus -- you brought it up just then with Hillary Clinton, that these were corrupt arrangements and that the Clinton Foundation was described as a criminal enterprise, and there was all this discussion of Russia. And you've pointed out --\nMR. SPICER: There is a big difference between -- there was dollars -- hold on --\nQ: I understand. I'm not conflating the President. I'm just asking, is he disappointed, now that he has found this out, that there was this --\nMR. SPICER: Found out what, Jonathan? That he had a client over a --\nQ: That he was working for Putin, for a lot of money.\nMR. SPICER: -- in the past decade, he had a client, and you're worried about what? That he held -- I mean --\nQ: That he was doing work to advance Putin's interests.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what work he was doing. So to suggest that just because he had a client in the past decade that no one is suggesting was anything improper -- he was hired to count delegates, which is what he did, and he was successful at it, as he had done for George Herbert Walker Bush, Gerald Ford, and Bob Dole. He was hired to do a job, and he did it, and he did it fine. So --\nSteven.\nQ: Sean, why did the President fire Paul Manafort?\nMR. SPICER: Well, for two reasons. One is, I think, that there were some issues coming up with his ties to Ukraine that were becoming a distraction. And secondly, he was, I think, sixteen points down at the time. And he was down in the 20s in women. And I think the President recognized that he needed to make a change for those two reasons.\nQ: Second question on healthcare. As confident and as optimistic as you are -- if at this point tomorrow you don't have the magic number -- should the Speaker pull the bill from the floor?\nMR. SPICER: No, this is it. If you want to see Obamacare repealed and replaced, this is the vote, this is the time to act. This is what people have told the American people is going to happen. This vote needs to happen. If you're waiting for your chance, this is it. We need to act.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thank you. Wall Street appears to be getting a little nervous about the possibility of tax reform this year. Can you say definitively that the President will present a package of tax reforms this year?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nDarlene.\nQ: What time is the President expected to meet with Chairman Nunes this afternoon?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I was walking out as the Chairman was reiterating -- I literally heard him on the streaming -- like, on the -- you know, his comments -- as he was saying them. So I don't know that it was scheduled. The President was wrapping up a call with Prime Minister May at the time that I walked out, so I don't know what was scheduled.\nQ: And was there any consideration given to not meeting with the Chairman given the appearance --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I just know what the Chairman said he was doing. I walked out of here before anything had been finalized. He was still wrapping up the call with Theresa May at the time.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You said the President is the closer, there is no plan B, tomorrow is it. So if you --\nMR. SPICER: You've done a very good job, Zeke. (Laughter.) You guys better be careful, he's going to put you out of work.\nQ: So if tomorrow night's outcome doesn't go your way, if the vote fails, what should we then read into the President's ability to negotiate and close deals; the White House's ability to plant any sort of legislation and a legislative --\nMR. SPICER: Look -- and I know what you're trying to get me to -- but we feel very good about the trajectory of this. Members continue to come with us. The number is going higher and higher, not lower and lower. So the trajectory is great. As I mentioned, everybody is out there -- full court press on this, and this is opportunity for anybody who wants to see this done.\nBut I just want to be clear, we have a robust agenda -- tax reform, as I just mentioned, trade, immigration. There's a lot of other things that need to get done. And I think there's continued to be widespread support. In a lot of cases, bipartisan support for the President's agenda. And so we're going to continue to roll on in that. But we feel very good about where we are now.\nMark.\nQ: Sean, I was going to ask, in terms of after the vote tomorrow night, for those Republicans who decide to not support the White House, what kind of relationship -- any change in the relationship -- would they see going forward? Would they expect to see maybe a primary challenge later on? Or this is one of those things where they can vote their conscience if they really believe this isn't the bill?\nMR. SPICER: I think we're obviously -- we believe that this is a great opportunity to achieve the principles that we laid out to the American people. We're not looking -- this is not -- the President made clear yesterday when he visited with the conference, he's not there to threaten them; he's there to explain political landscape to them, and to explain that -- I think that when you keep your promise, no matter what business you're in, you tend to be rewarded -- whether it's your customers or your friends, your family, your voters -- that Washington for too long has suffered a deficit of trust, and that we made very clear to the American people, if you gave us this opportunity and this honor to govern, that we would get certain things done. And this was at the top of that list.\nAnd this bill represents the best chance of repealing and replacing Obamacare and instilling a patient-centric healthcare system that increases choice and lowers cost, and that this is the only train leaving the station.\nJonathan.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Sean, would then-candidate Donald Trump have hired Paul Manafort, such an important and prominent position in his campaign, if he had known that he had had a $10 million contract with somebody so close to Vladimir Putin to \"greatly benefit the Putin government\"? If he had known that, would he have hired him?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I don't want to -- Paul was hired, as I said, to count delegates. That's why he was brought in, as he had been for George W. Bush, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole. He did his job. That's what he was there for. And --\nQ: And to run the campaign. I mean, he was chairman of the campaign.\nMR. SPICER: No, no. After, what, May 19th or something. But again, I'm not going to --\nQ: And to run the convention. I mean, you'll notch it was a very prominent role.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah -- as he had done for the other three. He had held very significant -- look, so again, you're basically saying, hey, the work that he did, he had a client a decade ago, would he have -- I don't know the answer to that --\nQ: $10 million to promote the interests of Vladimir Putin.\nMR. SPICER: The answer to your question -- I don't know. To look back right now and to say, if we knew now what we know then, would we have done things different? I don't know. That's a question that the President would have to weigh at the time.\nQ: But he definitely didn't know.\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: You're saying he didn't know.\nMR. SPICER: No, he did not know.\nQ: He had not idea that Manafort had done this.\nMR. SPICER: Of course, not. To suggest that he -- I mean, that's like -- you can think about how many people are involved in a campaign of some sort. And granted, in this campaign it was run lean and mean. But to suggest that everybody knew everybody's background -- did they pay their taxes, how much did they pay, what deductions did they take, who did they work for in the --\nQ: Shouldn't he have disclosed that? I mean, he did work for --\nMR. SPICER: Disclosed what? That he had done --\nQ: He had worked on behalf of an adversary of the United States. He got a $10 million contract.\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not here to vouch for what he did or how -- I don't know.\nQ: -- but the President would want to know, wouldn't he?\nMR. SPICER: Maybe. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know what the circumstances were at the time, and I don't know what exactly -- so for me to start to infer that what he did or did not do was anything improper is not appropriate at this time. I don't know what work he did. I know what he was hired to do, and he did his job.\nShane.\nQ: I want to ask about Paul Manafort here, too. Are you saying he wasn't disappointed to learn, in the last 24 hours, that his chief strategist worked for Vladimir Putin's --\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- no, no -- because again, you're --\nQ: What was his reaction --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know, because the story that came out this morning said that he had had client. Paul has put out a statement that suggests this is what he did, this is how he handled it, there were -- I mean, you've all read the same. We have not spent a ton of time going to investigate what he did for that client a decade ago.\nQ: Is the President disappointed to learn that this was --\nMR. SPICER: I really have not discussed the President's -- I know what he has made very clear: He hired him to do a job, he did the job well, he got him over the finish line. On August 19th, he was let go of the campaign for the reasons that I have mentioned.\nQ: Can you say if Paul Manafort played any role in the hiring of any people in the federal government after the election? Did he advise the President?\nMR. SPICER: Not to my knowledge, at all.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Going back to the American Health Care Act, there was always nervousness that moving too quickly on it would leave some very dangerous points in the details. Several publications, including Sara's, reported today that as a result of a change of a few words, veterans who benefitted from a program called Veterans Affairs, or had the option of getting tax credits, would not get neither under the new legislation, and that 7 million veterans would be cost healthcare. Is the administration following this, and is urging Congress to do anything about it?\nMR. SPICER: Most veterans get their healthcare either through TRICARE or through Medicare, if they're over 65 or a combination thereof, correct?\nQ: Well -- but there's two programs. One is the Veterans Affairs program, and the other is the option -- this is under the current law -- to have tax credits. And my understanding, again, from Sara's publication this morning and several others, is that 7 million veterans could possibly lose both under this program.\nMR. SPICER: I would have to follow-up with you. I'm not aware of any modifications to TRICARE in particular that would have that effect.\nKristen.\nQ: Sean, thanks. On Monday, the President accused former President Obama and Democrats of rushing through the healthcare law -- jamming it through -- when, in fact, they actually debated it for about a year. This healthcare law was rolled out about 15 days ago. So don't you run the risk of rushing this through, of not giving it enough time for public debate?\nMR. SPICER: I think Republicans have talked about repealing and replacing Obamacare since 2010. We've campaigned on it in every election since. The principles that are in a lot of these have been very public for a long time. And --\nQ: Understood. But you just rolled out the specifics, Sean. You just rolled out the actual --\nMR. SPICER: And it's gone through three committees, two of which had unanimous Republican support.\nQ: Just a few days ago.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But we're working it through the process. This was something the President campaigned on, told the American people would be his top priority. Republicans who ran for the House and Senate said that it would be a top priority. It's something that they talked about for seven years, Kristen. So to suggest that we're rushing anything -- I think we've done this very, very, very deliberately, and very responsibly to make sure that people could read it.\nSo again, with all due respect to the folks who tackled this in the past, we actually put the bill online, let everyone in the entire world read it, didn't jam it through and, to quote former Speaker Pelosi, say, if you want to read the bill, wait until we pass it. We actually let the American people and the entire world read what was in it, watch the process occur, and I think that is a much more open and transparent process.\nQ: Let me just ask you a quick question about the terror attack. You said that the President has been briefed. He also spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May. Can you give us any more information about who may have been behind it? And should Americans have any concern, or are there any security changes that they should expect --\nMR. SPICER: No, that would be highly irresponsible at this point. I know the British government is investigating this as an act of terrorism at this moment. So for me to sort of get out and ahead of -- I know our homeland security team and our national security team are in contact with them. Secretary Tillerson has issued a statement, as has Homeland Security Secretary Kelly.\nSo we are continuing to monitor the situation. We're in touch with officials in the British government. As I mentioned, as I was walking out here, the President was finishing up a call with Prime Minister May, and so we'll try to have an additional readout to you, to the extent that that's possible. But we're going to provide the assistance we can to the British government to help get to the bottom of this. At this time, it would be highly irresponsible for us to get out in front of British officials.\nCharlie.\nQ: You mentioned that there is no plan B, that plan A is the only vehicle -- the only train leaving the station, I believe you said. Does that mean if the plan fails -- if the bill fails, will the President move on to other issues he's concerned about, like trade, and leave Obamacare in place? And if so, how long is he comfortable with leaving it in place?\nMR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned -- I mean, we're not going to leave it in place because we're going to repeal and replace it tomorrow, move it through the Senate, and the President will sign the bill. We continue to see the enthusiasm and momentum coming to our direction. So I'm not looking -- as I mentioned, we're not looking at a plan B. We have plan A, it's going to pass, and we're going to go from there.\nJessica.\nQ: I'm going to talk about China for moment. Do you now have the ability to formally announce the dates for when President Xi visits the United States?\nMR. SPICER: I do not know at this time.\nQ: Why not?\nMR. SPICER: Because that's not how it works. Because that's something that we continue to work with President Xi and the Chinese government to coordinate the final dates and times. And then obviously we coordinate the announcement with them as well. But trust me, when we're ready, we'll let you and everyone else know.\nQ: And are you going to be prepared to talk about the parameters of the bilateral relationship at that time?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure that -- my guess is there will be a lot to discuss at that time.\nJeff.\nQ: Sean, has the President asked the FBI director or the NSA or any other agencies involved to come here to the White House and brief him on this new information, or is it just the intel chair? And if so, why not?\nMR. SPICER: Well, Jeff, it just happened. So it's a silly question to ask me, literally as I'm walking out here, when the Chairman was wrapping up an event saying that he is announcing that he is coming down here. It's not like we picked up the phone and then called everyone else. The first step is to actually hear what he has to say and to find out who else he's briefed, where he's got that information from, and then we'll take the next steps going forward.\nQ: Is this the first of several meetings, though? Do you believe he would like to have the FBI director come in?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. It's literally -- it literally just happened as I was walking out here. So to suggest that other steps have occurred, until that briefing occurs we'll see what this leads to. I don't know.\nQ: What's the state of his credibility tonight? The Wall Street Journal, which has been very supportive of his candidacy and agenda, simply raised a question that he is not doing very well, and they said he could be on the verge of being a \"fake President.\" What do you believe the state of his credibility is as we sit here today in week nine?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has made several promises to the American people, and he's kept them. He appointed Neil Gorsuch as the judge, which was one of 20 people on a list. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He established a five-year lobbying ban and a foreign ban on -- lifetime, which is all what he said he was going to do.\nHe said he was going to cut regulations, and he did that. He said he was going to start to bring back jobs -- he did that. He said that he was going to start to pay real attention and respect taxpayers, bringing down costs. He's already done that. He's backed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. We've talked about that ad nauseam. He's talked about putting forth a budget that puts defense first -- he did that. He took action on Dakota and Keystone Pipeline -- he did that.\nI think when it comes to the President making promises to the American people and keeping them, he's got a pretty high record of doing it.\nPeter.\nQ: Sean, if I could ask you about the conversation we've been having about Paul Manafort, but not specific to Paul Manafort. When Michael Flynn's name came up at the time, having not registered as a foreign agent, there was a lot of focus on the vetting process that goes into individuals. Back then you said, \"We trust people to fill out the appropriate forms that they need to. He has been very\" -- referring to the President -- \"he has been very committed to making sure we institute high standards here and we're held to them.\"\nSo given your words, is it sufficient to trust the information that the people you hire give you? And can you say with certainty with right now that there isn't anybody else that's working in the interests of another foreign government working for this government right now?\nMR. SPICER: It's a good question, Peter, because there's a big difference between working for a campaign or an entity where there's no forms to fill out -- when you work for the United States government, especially here in the White House, you fill out a security clearance form, you fill out an employment form that asks certain questions under the penalty of law.\nThose questions --\nQ: And Michael Flynn still got through, I guess.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. No, well -- but again, he filled out forms under the penalty of law. I don't know what was on his forms or what not was on his forms. Remember, what the President let him go for was not being truthful to the Vice President, not necessarily for what was on a form, which I do not know what he filled out or did not fill out.\nIf somebody fills out a form here, an SF-86, a security clearance form, or another employment document, and lies on that form or misleads, then they're going to face the penalty of law on that. That's a big difference between saying when someone was hired on a campaign or another entity, that they should disclose everything in their past whether or not they -- who their clients were. But again, I mean, if someone presented a rйsumй and it was faulty, sure, I think that if that was -- as you recall, there was another person during the transition that was named to a position that was discussed as not being truthful with some of their works. We let them go.\nPeople write things. They have jobs. They describe themselves a certain way. And every time that I'm aware of that we've had an incident where someone has not been forthright and truthful, we've let them go. But when you work for the United States government, you actually fill out security clearance forms, employment forms under the penalty of law. None of those cases occurred in the past. And to dredge up someone's work from a decade ago -- it's not that Paul wasn't truthful, just to be clear -- you're trying to conflate something that's there. You're trying to make the accusation that somehow he was dishonest or distruthful.\nQ: I'm not asking about Paul Manafort --\nMR. SPICER: No, you are.\nQ: I'm not asking about Paul Manafort at all.\nMR. SPICER: Who are you asking about?\nQ: In fact, what I'm asking is, can you say with certainty that right now -- that there's nobody working for this White House that is presently working in the interest of a foreign government?\nMR. SPICER: I can tell you that every form has been filled out --\nQ: So you trust that the information is --\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. You've got to -- people who are filling out forms -- so to sit here and ask me whether I can vouch for -- whatever it is -- a few hundred people that have filled out everything, that would be ridiculous for me to stand here and suggest that I possibly could.\nWhat I can tell you is, under the penalty of law, every single person has filled out a form that is being vetted by whatever level of classification that they need to get by the appropriate law enforcement agencies or HR entities. But I can't prevent somebody from fully disclosing everything on their taxes or filling out a form. What I can tell you is that -- and if there is an instance brought to our attention where someone has misled it, either they will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency or dismissed, or appropriate action will be taken.\nBut yes, there is no tolerance for that.\nQ: And then very quickly, in regards to Devin Nunes and the fact that he's going to come today and the comments that you began the briefing by telling us -- on March 4th, the President tweeted: \"How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\" Does the President stand by his statement that President Obama is a \"bad (or sick) guy\"?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's tweets stand for themselves.\nQ: So he thinks he's a \"bad (or sick) guy.\"\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to answer the question --\nQ: Okay, but you said it stood for itself, so I was asking.\nMR. SPICER: I know. I think the President's tweets speak for themselves. As for the rest of the tweets, let's see, as we've mentioned before, how this process evolves and what information we can further gather up.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On the executive order on energy independence, that's been delayed for several weeks now. Can you --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, why would it be delayed? We never announced them.\nQ: Your office said that it was going to be released several weeks ago. It wasn't. And then there were reports consequently that said it would be released, and it hasn't been. So can you give us --\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- with all due respect, I don't believe I ever announced that that was scheduled to come out.\nQ: Okay. Can you tell us when it will be released?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And also, in it, it addresses the Clean Power Plan, which is the Obama-era climate change regulation. And there is apparently no replacement opportunity in that executive order.\nMR. SPICER: Can I just -- I'm going to cut you off here. We've discussed executive orders in the past. I've told before -- until they're ready to be announced, I don't comment on the scheduling or the --\nQ: This is a policy question --\nMR. SPICER: I know it is, but you're asking me the contents of it. It's not a policy question.\nQ: No, no, I just haven't been able to finish my question.\nMR. SPICER: Okay.\nQ: Thank you. So apparently there's no replacement for it. That is the answer to a Supreme Court ruling in 2007. Does the administration feel that it is legally bound to regulate greenhouse gases?\nMR. SPICER: Let's wait and see what the executive order says or doesn't say. I don't want to get into --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I understand the question. I'm not getting ahead of this at this point.\nQ: Sean, will President Trump hold a news conference on the attack? And also, on his upcoming travel, do you have any guidance on other rallies that he may have? Because that's where he sends his message out to the American people, including social media.\nMR. SPICER: He sends his message out in a lot of ways. If there are rallies, then I would refer you to the campaign website to get updates there. As for future press conferences, stay tuned on when the next one is going to be.\nQ: Sean, when you learned that the members of the President's team may have been in contact with someone who the intelligence community and a federal judge has deemed to be a little bit dodgy, does that give you any pause at all?\nMR. SPICER: Who are you referring to?\nQ: The people who are subject to the FISA order.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, can you rephrase the question?\nQ: It's a reference to Nunes. Members of the President's team, whether it's the transition or the campaign, are said to have been in contact -- being picked up by when they were in contact with someone who was the subject of a FISA order. Does that give you any pause at all given the things that you haven't known before about Manafort and Flynn, et cetera?\nMR. SPICER: Not until we know further details. I think to get ahead of what we know -- until we know what the chairman is going to brief him on, for me to suggest what he is going to reveal to him about whom and when and how would be inappropriate, at this point, to comment on.\nI'm going to go to Elizabeth Crisp out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nQ: Hi, Sean, thanks. Last year, Louisiana suffered one of the worst flooding disasters in our nation's history. Today, thousands of people remain displaced, and communities are struggling to rebuild. With support from the Obama administration, the state received about $1.6 billion in flood assistance through the CDBG program. The state is seeking $2 billion more in federal aid, and our governor has asked for President Trump's support.\nSo my question is twofold. What is the Trump administration's position exactly on the federal government's role in long-term disaster recovery efforts? And also, can Louisiana count on this administration's support for additional flood recovery assistance?\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, Elizabeth. I believe the process works such that the governor makes a request to FEMA; FEMA then puts it through the process. I'm not aware of what the request is or where it stands in the process, and I would refer you back to FEMA on that.\nQ: This is actually -- this is aid separate from FEMA. It's the long-term part to this.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. So I know that the budget that was just presented allows for substantial funding for humanitarian assistance, including disaster refugee program funding in priority areas. I think at this point the budget process has just kicked off, and we will now begin the process of working with Congress on -- them draft a budget, and talk about our priorities and where they go forward.\nThe President will have a full budget out in May, and so that will be an appropriate time to do that. But I would refer you back to the governor at this point, and figure out where that stands in the process.\nCecilia.\nQ: Can you say today, with certainty, that Paul Manafort never tried to pressure or encourage the campaign to take on a more pro-Russia position on any issues?\nMR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of. I can't -- but there's nothing that suggests that that was the case.\nQ: And on Nunes, from what you know about what he has said so far, is the White House viewing this, in any way, as vindication of the President's wiretapping tweets?\nMR. SPICER: I would refer you to his comment specifically. Until we know what he is going to brief the President on, I don't want to have to get ahead of this. I think, obviously, the suggestion that he made that people were what they call \"unmasked,\" meaning that an American citizen who is caught up in a surveillance has, by rule of law, has their name protected; the idea that individuals' names were unmasked and let known suggests -- raises serious questions: Why was that name unmasked? What was the intention of doing that?\nThere's a lot of questions that I think his statement raises, and I hope that we can continue to get to the bottom of. But right now, we just don't -- we're not there yet. I think that there are a series of questions that need to get answered as to what happened, why it happened, and hopefully we will be able to share more with you going forward.\nTodd.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On the border wall, the President's budget blueprint calls for a couple of dozen lawyers who are going to be dedicated to acquiring land. And I think people are wondering just how aggressive the eminent domain effort is going to be, and how that squares with respect for private property rights.\nMR. SPICER: As I recall, during the Bush administration similar efforts were undertaken to secure the appropriate property that would be where a fence or a wall, in this case, would be. So this is nothing new. This is the government doing what it has to do to protect its border. I think there's nobody in America, and I daresay the world, that didn't believe that the President was committed to building a wall. And I think that we're going to take the steps necessary to fulfill that promise, to make sure that we have to.\nSo I know that the steps are starting to be taken both in terms of the funding and the administrative steps, to see the President's vision fulfilled on this pledge that he made to the American people. And we'll go from there.\nQ: Is there any update on how the wall will be financed?\nMR. SPICER: I think both the 2017 supplemental has some initial funding in it. The 2018 budget does, and has two --\nQ: But that's general. I'm talking about where the money will come from.\nMR. SPICER: Right. And I think that we're going to continue to do it. Right now, the initial funding that was put in place will allow it to begin. The President has been very clear that using existing resources we'd go forward. There would be continuing discussions about the financing of the wall, both in terms of how we will pay for it and who will be the source of that payment.\nQ: Has he given up on Mexico paying for it?\nMR. SPICER: No, not at all.\nThank you guys, very much. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll try to have updates on the subjects that are currently pending. Thank you.\nEND 2:40 P.M.

Price. Also participating in the meeting were National Economic Council Director Gary D. Cohn; State Sens. Donna Campbell and Dawn Buckingham of Texas; Steffany Williams, chairwoman, Novant Health Professional Nurses Council; Lina Varela-Gonzalez, director of nursing, Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center Emergency Department; and Parmis Khatibi, anticoagulation/antithrombotic and tobacco treatment specialist, University of California—Irvine Medical Center.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123592", "text": "The President. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate you being here. It's a great honor, very great honor. I want to thank Vice President Pence, Secretary Tom Price, and Administrator Seema Verma—who's done an incredible job, by the way—for all of the time and energy they've put into repairing and replacing Obamacare ahead of tomorrow's crucial vote. Big vote tomorrow in the House.\nI want to especially thank Seema, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services—a wonderful job she's doing and definitely a complex job, but you have it under control, right—[laughter]—for hosting this very important meeting to discuss the vital role women play in health care and the hardships inflicted on them by the Obamacare catastrophe. It's been bad.\nAdministrator Seema Verma is playing the leading role for us in helping us to repeal and replace Obamacare. The doctors, nurses, and health care professionals here today represent the millions of women—millions and millions—who play a vital and indispensable role in Americans' health care. Unfortunately, Obamacare is making their lives so much more difficult, as we all know, and putting enormous barriers in the way of helping patients who we are going to help. We're going to get this thing done. We're going to get it figured out. It's a tough situation our country has been put in. It's not easy.\nWomen doctors and health care leaders have changed the face of health care in America, saving and improving countless American lives. In 1965, only 9 percent of accepted medical school applicants were women—9 percent. Last year, nearly 50 percent of newly accepted applicants were women. Congratulations. Good job. It's a good job. Thirty-eight percent of physicians and surgeons are women, and that number will continue to grow. That's a big victory for our society, big victory for America.\nI want to also thank all of the women nurses and health care aides for their incredible service and dedication to our country. What you do is remarkable. Unfortunately, Obamacare is making it much harder for all of the doctors, nurses, and health care professionals—men and women alike—to do their job. As insurers flee Obamacare's broken marketplace—and it is broken, it's broken badly; the insurance companies are fleeing—millions of patients can no longer access the health care professionals the know and trust. That was \"keep your doctor, keep your plan\"—didn't work out that way. You don't get your doctor; you don't get your plan.\nSo that is one of the more vital reasons why we must repeal Obamacare. It's one of the reasons why we're here today.\nSo with that, I want to turn it over to Administrator Verma, and we'll start a meeting.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you very much. You could probably do it and stay for this little while, and then, we'll clear out the room and talk, okay?\nAdministrator Verma. Sounds great.\nThe President. Go ahead. Administrator Verma. Well, thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you.\nAdministrator Verma. Appreciate it. This gentleman has been very supportive as I started my position at CMS, and I am very appreciative to be a part of this great health care team.\nThe President. Thank you.\nAdministrator Verma. And thanks to all the women that came today. It's great to see so many strong, professional women that are on the frontlines of healthcare. So thanks again for coming today.\nObamacare has just been a broken promise. Instead of meaningful health care, we have higher costs, less choices, and more mandates. Right now we have the Government that's making decisions about our health care, not patients and not doctors. As a mother and as a woman, the most important thing about my health care is being able to pick out the doctor that I feel comfortable with, but unfortunately, with Obamacare, we have less choices.\nOne-third of counties and five States only have one choice of health plan. And so that tells us we are not getting the choices that Americans deserve. And the problem is getting worse. We have even more insurers that are saying that they're going to leave the marketplace.\nAnd I think the other thing that concerns me is hearing from providers. Many providers are faced with dealing with regulations and mandates instead of focusing on high-quality care and spending time with their patients. They are forced to deal with regulations.\nAnd I came to DC because I was so concerned about the direction our health care was going in because of Obamacare. I want to be a part of the solution. I'm very excited about the American Health Care Act, if there's a vote on that tomorrow. I think this is an opportunity for us to finally get rid of Obamacare and move towards a system that's going to drive costs down, give Americans more choices, and put patients and doctors in control of their health care.\nSo once again, thank you for coming today. And I look forward to hearing all the stories. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-22", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting on Women in Health Care"}

I think we're going to have a lot of meetings over the years, and I very much appreciate you being here.\nThroughout my campaign, I pledged to focus on improving conditions for African American citizens. This means more to me than anybody would understand or know. Every American child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high-paying jobs.\nAmerica has spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas. I guess, I heard just recently in the Middle East we've spent as of about 2 months ago $6 trillion—$6 trillion, and you know where we are over there—while neglecting the fate of American children in cities like Baltimore and Chicago and Detroit.\nAfrican American citizens have given so much to this country. They've fought in every war since the Revolution, and they've fought hard. They've lifted up the conscience of our Nation in the march toward civil rights, enriched the soul of America—and their faith and courage. And they've advanced our country in the fields of science, arts, and medicine.\nElijah Cummings, who was here about 2 weeks ago, who I happen to think is a terrific man—I don't know if he'll say that about me, but I will tell you, I really liked him a lot. And we were talking about drugs and prescription drugs and the costs. And you go to Europe, you go to Canada, you go to other countries, and you buy them for a fraction of what you pay in this country. And that's been a very big subject for him, and it's a subject for me that is very important. And we're going to either do it in health care—which I think we're going to do it in health care—or we're going to do it separately.\nBut we're going to bid on drug prices, and we're going to try and have the lowest prices anywhere in the world, from really the highest. And that's not only the drugs, it's prescription drugs. But you go out to stores, and you go even—in any community, rich or poor community, and you look at the kind of drug prices that we're paying, and it's really unfair what's happened in our country.\nSo we're going to be instituting a very, very strong bidding process. We'll probably need some legislation, but we're going to do it regardless. We have to do it. And we're going to get drug prices way down, way down. Some people think it's as important as the health care measure, because people are being ripped off when they need their—they need drugs; they need prescription drugs. And we're going to take care of that situation.\nSo again, I very much appreciate your being here. It's a tremendous honor for me. And we're going to work on different things, and we're going to see if we can get a lot accomplished.\nAnd with that, let's get going. And thank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-22", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Members of the Congressional Black Caucus"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123598", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:38 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. I want to start by acknowledging, as the President did a little while ago, that a great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the terror attack in London yesterday.\nOur prayers are with his family and friends. We're aware of reports that another American citizen was injured, as well as the potential as this story continues to develop -- we stand ready to provide consular assistance, but considering some privacy concerns, I'm not going to further discuss the current state of any of those individuals at this time.\nAs I said yesterday, the President spoke with UK Prime Minister May to offer his condolences and pledge the full cooperation and support of the United States government in responding to this attack and bringing those responsible to justice.\nNow, a little bit on today's schedule. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with over 30 members of the House Freedom Caucus to discuss building momentum towards replacing and repealing Obamacare with the American Health Care Act.\nThe members of the Freedom Caucus thanked the President for engaging with them throughout their negotiations, and the President, likewise, thanked the group for their willingness to work closely with the White House and their colleagues to craft the strongest possible bill. The group agreed that their ultimate goal is to implement a system that will drive down costs and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans, and this meeting was, I think, a very positive step towards achieving that goal.\nThis was just the latest in a series of discussions, in-person and on the phone, that the President, the Vice President and his team have had, holding with Republican House members on the American Health Care Act. This afternoon, we expect the President to continue those meetings with members of the Tuesday Group from the House, coming up here later today.\nSince the law was introduced, the legislative affairs team has been in constant contact with members the American people will be counting on to fulfill their promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare by supporting this bill later tonight.\nIn the past few days, the President has been on the phone with scores of Republican members, in addition to the in-persons meetings you've seen with the Republican Study Committee, the House Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group. This bill has truly been a collaborative effort from the beginning. Through an open and deliberative process, the President and his team have helped to negotiate a very, very strong bill. He was on the phone last night well into the 11 o'clock hour with members on an individual basis, discussing their support for the bill.\nThe amendments that have been incorporated add important aspects to the bill, like removing costly \"essential health benefit\" insurance regulations; repealing Obamacare taxes immediately, starting in 2017; reforming Medicaid by allowing states to accept funding as a block grant to implement able-bodied work requirements; and blocking states from receiving enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages if they expanded during the transition.\nWe've already seen the results, with many members coming out and saying they're going to be a \"yes\" tonight. As I've noted before, today is actually the 7th -- and we hope, the last -- anniversary of the day that President Obama signed Obamacare.\nThe President is looking forward to seeing Republicans fulfill the pledge tonight that they've been making to their constituents for years that, with a Republican in the White House and with them in Congress, they would once and for all see the end of Obamacare.\nThe President -- I assume that President Obama must be feeling this time is up for his signature law, since today he came out with a rather lengthy statement about it. But he can't change the facts about where it stands. President Obama stated that Americans received an \"upgrade\" in insurance. But the mandates Obamacare placed on insurance forced millions off their insurance and away from their doctor, which broke the promise that they were given.\nPresident Obama attempted to move the goal posts on costs, downplaying the skyrocketing premiums, some in the case of over 100 percent in some places, and unaffordable deductibles. Americans -- he seems to have forgotten that he pushed Obamacare on the promise of reducing costs, not making health care unaffordable.\nPresident Obama said Obamacare isn't -- quote -- in a \"death spiral.\" But enrollment is nowhere near expectations, and this year it's actually declining. Insurers are fleeing the exchanges and one in three counties in America only has one insurer.\nPresident Obama may not believe the Obamacare is a \"job-killer\" but the new law, including its job-killing taxes, mandates and regulations, speaks for itself. With the passage of the American Health Care Act, we will begin the process of rolling back Obamacare's many disastrous policies.\nAnd, of course, it's not just a big day on the House side. Over on the Senate, we begin the final and fourth day of Judge Gorsuch's Senate Judiciary hearings. Earlier today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced that Senate Democrats would be mounting a filibuster against his nomination.\nFrom day one, we've said that the President made an inspired choice with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. The American Bar Association has given them their highest rating of \"well qualified.\" This week, though, through all four days, he has showcased his sterling credentials and a brilliant legal mind.\nWe find Senator Schumer's announcement truly disappointing, because it breaks with the tradition of how the Senate has handled Supreme Court confirmation votes in modern time -- and represents the type of partisanship that Americans have grown tired of.\nIn the last half-century, only three Supreme Court justices have ever faced a filibuster. The most recent -- Justice Alito -- was opposed by then-Senator Obama who voted to uphold his filibuster, and later admitted that his vote was a politically motivated act that he regretted. In fact, Senate Republicans didn't filibuster his Supreme Court nominees, Kagan and Sotomayor.\nWe call on Senator Schumer to follow Democrats to abandon this attempt to block Judge Gorsuch from receiving a fair up or down vote that he and the American people have voted for.\nBack to the rest of the President's schedule. This afternoon, the President, as I mentioned, will meet with members of the Tuesday Group. He had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin and Nelson Peltz.\nAt 3 o'clock today we hope you'll come out and join the President to welcome the truck drivers and truck company CEOs who he will be meeting with on the American Health Care Act as they arrive to the White House alongside two rather large big-rigs. One in every 16 Americans work for the trucking industry. It's the backbone of our country's domestic freight transportation and it moves over 70 percent of domestic freight tonnage.\nBut the trucking industry has suffered greatly under Obamacare. Many truckers were forced to buy healthcare plans that weren't necessarily right for them on the exchanges. Like millions of Americans across the country, they saw their premiums rise and their options plummet. And trucking companies, classified as large employers under the law, are mandated to provide insurance that we already know doesn't work.\nInstead of imposing senseless restrictions from Washington, the President's three-pronged healthcare reform plan will lower premiums and increase choice by increasing competition. The President looks forward to discussing how these policies, combined with forthcoming tax, regulatory and trade reforms, will provide much needed relief for the trucking industry.\nAlso today, the Vice President met with President Hernandez of Honduras. A readout on that meeting is available from the Vice President's office.\nAnd a few notes before I get to your questions. As the President noted during his first Cabinet meeting earlier this month, while many of his spectacularly qualified choices to lead his departments and agencies are already in place and taking action to fulfill the President's ambitious agenda, there are still some important positions that have not been filled, in large part to to Senate Democrats' obstruction. I wanted to give you a quick update on still some of the outstanding confirmations.\nSecretary of Labor-designate Alex Acosta had a very successful hearing yesterday, and we expect markup next week.\nSecretary of Agriculture-designate, former governor Sonny Perdue is currently appearing before the Senate Ag Committee. We expect Governor Perdue to continue to show why he's the best choice to lead the USDA, and hopefully his markup to be scheduled in the coming days.\nWe also announced earlier this afternoon that Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark will be visiting the White House on March 30th. We'll have further details on the visit in the upcoming days.\nTomorrow, the President will hose Medal of Honor recipients and their guests in celebration of Medal of Honor Day, which falls on Saturday of this year. We'll have some more details on that event coming forward.\nThe President intends to be here this weekend, so as we have updates on the President's weekend plans we will let you know as well. I'll also note that we've got -- coming up on a deadline related to the Keystone pipeline. We'll have an update on that for you tomorrow.\nAnd finally, I'm proud to announce that on April 19th, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the New England Patriots will be visiting the White House to celebrate their latest -- and what will probably be a continuation of many more to come -- Super Bowl win.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nJeff Mason.\nQ: Sean --\nQ: This is a Patriot question. (Laughter.)\nQ: No, it's not. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Do you know anything about Tom Brady's jersey? Is this --\nQ: I've got nothing on that. But I have a healthcare question for you. First, do you expect there to be a vote tonight?\nMR. SPICER: That's what I understand the House has scheduled, yes.\nQ: Any chance that that's going to be pushed back?\nMR. SPICER: That would be obviously up to Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy, but I have been -- nothing leads me to believe that that's the case.\nQ: Is the President concerned at all that as he draws support for the bill from the Freedom Caucus that he may lose support from more moderate groups of the House?\nMR. SPICER: He's meeting with members of the Tuesday Group today. Obviously this is something that he understands -- there's a little bit of a balancing act that goes on as you try to get 216 in this case. But I think we continue to make progress every day. We walked out with more members in support of the American Health Care Act today than we started the day with, and I continue to see that number climb hour by hour. And I anticipate that we will get there.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, Patrick McHenry said \"we have an offer that\" -- speaking of the House Freedom Caucus -- \"can accept it or reject it.\" Is that the way that you see it at this moment? Are you just waiting on the House Freedom Caucus to come to your side? Are you at their whims at this point? What's their status as far as you know?\nMR. SPICER: I think there are some members who, in the meeting, stood up and told the President, I'm with you now. And I think member by member, that's how they're going to vote. I think we've continued to see that number rise. And the same thing with the Tuesday Group. There are members that had not been with us that are expressing their willingness to want to be part of this.\nThe President went over several commitments and changes that had been made to assuage different folks that have continued to evolve, and I think that we continue to see the number rise. But I think that we continue to see the number go up not down, and that's a very positive sign.\nQ: Do you know how many came across and what it was that brought them across in that meeting?\nMR. SPICER: It depends. Again, I don't think there's any singular issue in a lot of cases. There's a lot -- I think we talked a little bit about sections of the bill that there was an issue with. And so I think there's a couple areas that there is some common ground on. But there was over 30 members there today, and some of them had specific aspects that they wanted to see improved, and some of them, frankly, came to say, hey, thank you, I think that what you guys have done already has been an improvement.\nQ: With them is it essential health benefits? Is that their main sticking point as far as you know?\nMR. SPICER: In a lot of cases -- there were some members that that was their number-one thing. But, again, it wasn't universal across the board. But, again, I think some of the measures that have been taken along the way have really -- and again, there's also, beyond that, there's a lot of discussion about phase two and phase three, and I think the President and the Vice President both committed to continuing working and improving and making commitments on the totality and the comprehensive nature of how we're going to do this.\nFor a lot of these guys it really comes down to premium increases. They're very concerned about what they're seeing their constituents face. And I think the President and the Vice President, Secretary Price, Director Mulvaney, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, the legislative affairs team -- we're all continuing to work with them to talk about certain measures that have been put in place to drive down cost.\nAnd I think when you realize what we continue to talk about, that costs are too high, premiums are spiking, deductibles are going up, choices are going down -- these are real concerns for constituents of these members. And I think that as they see an overall and total commitment of this, it's making them feel a lot better about not just this bill, but phases two and three.\nMatt.\nQ: Two questions, both on healthcare. First one -- is the President open to removing protections for preexisting conditions from the bill?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's been something that he's been very clear needs to stay in there.\nQ: Okay. Secondly, about this essential benefits protection. Obviously among those is maternity leave. So how would removing that jive with the President's promise during the campaign to expand maternity leave? Obviously this would take it out and insurers would no longer have to provide that.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, and again, I don't want to get into a benefit-by-benefit discussion here, but I think that there's a lot of concerns, as I just said to Blake, that part of the reason that premiums have spiked out of control is because under Obamacare there were these mandated services that had to be included. And what happened was is that older men, older women who had gone past maternity age were buying benefits that weren't necessary for them. People who were at the younger end of the age scale were buying end-of-life benefits.\nAnd I think this goes back to the nut of this discussion, Matt, which is we have now gone down to a system where in one-third of all counties there's one choice, and it's this potpourri of mandated benefits that everyone has to have. We've lost consumer choice. And so people are paying for benefits that neither they, their spouse, their family needs, which is driving up costs for everybody.\nAnd so part of it isn't about necessarily a benefit. It's about a series of benefits being mandated for everybody. And so what has happened is that the costs of healthcare for every individual has gone up and the choice has gone down. And I think there is a philosophical discussion that is going on about what we can do to make sure that people have actual coverage -- something that we've talked about before -- but doing so in a way that doesn't drive up the cost for everybody.\nQ: So one follow-up on that then. Is the President concerned that without having those essential benefits in there, he'll have a situation where women are just de factor paying higher for health insurance? Obviously they'd be paying for maternity leave.\nMR. SPICER: No, you could have a family plan. In other words, the point is, is that it's not -- again, you're picking one benefit and trying to extrapolate it. It's also saying should young people have to pay for end-of-life care.\nThe idea is to instill choice back into the market so that it's not just about one particular benefit, it's allowing people to tailor a plan and a cost point that's good for them or their family or them and their spouse. But it's not just about one particular benefit, it's about looking at this and figuring out what are the cost drivers and how do we give people the choice that they need.\nSara.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The White House and House leadership initially defended the way this bill was written by saying it needed to be structured a certain way and exclude certain things to be able to proceed through the Senate through budget reconciliation. So what's changed to put now these pretty substantive policy changes on the table? What's given the White House and Republicans confidence that now it can survive through that same process in the Senate?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a lot of discussion that goes on. Without getting too into it, the issue at hand is the Byrd Rule and whether or not it affects the budgetary -- you can't have policymaking things that don't have a budgetary impact. There are certain things that are being phrased in certain ways and crafted in accordance with the rule. But there's a lot of smart people that are very familiar with the rules and are trying to do things in a way to make this bill conform in those ways.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions for you. One on the healthcare bill first. A question about the way this bill is now being modified to basically pick up votes. On Monday night the amendment included that special carve-out for upstate New York -- had a bunch of good nicknames that I can't do justice for -- but they also announced these latest (inaudible.) Is the President concerned that this bill now looks a lot like -- procedurally, it looks a lot like what Obamacare looked like seven years ago that Republicans have spent seven years criticizing the way that bill was brought to the floor, and here they are seven years later on the same day about to do the exact same thing?\nMR. SPICER: No, not at all. In fact, it's doing exactly what we intended to do. I mean, the exchange that we had with Matt, it's actually going -- the two goals that it set out to do it's actually doing -- driving costs down, find ways to lower premiums, keep deductibles within reason, or at least giving people the option to choose a plan that fits their budget, and then, secondly, is doing things that instill competition, choice.\nSo the things that are being done actually achieve the goals that have been set forth.\nQ: Sean, just one for you on a different question. Yesterday, Secretary Mattis and Chairman Dunford testified on Capitol Hill that they were willing to, before Congress, have a public debate around a new AUMF. Is that something that -- traditionally, those have started in the executive branch. Is the White House willing to put one forward and willing to begin that round of discussions?\nMR. SPICER: I'd refer you back to Secretary Mattis. I think that that is one that's the Department of Defense is --\nQ: So is that statement operative for the White House, that the White House now is calling --\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that that was brought up in the context of a conversation that he is willing to have with respect to overseas contingencies that are existing right now in the battle, especially with respect to ISIS, and the current tools that we have to combat them. But I think that was a discussion about whether or not we should have a discussion on authorized use of force or not, and how to have that.\nJim.\nQ: Now that Chuck Schumer has announced a definite filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch, do you think it's time for the White House to take a stand on eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees?\nMR. SPICER: I am not going to -- I'll let -- Senator McConnell is a much more apt user and understanding of the Senate rules. I'm not going to start to tell Senator McConnell what he should be doing from here.\nQ: He's your nominee, and --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And it's his rules and his chamber that he leads. So I'm going to let that --\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Has anybody from the national security team or the homeland security folks been in touch with their counterparts in London in the last 24 hours or so?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Can you expound on that at all?\nMR. SPICER: Only to the extent to say that they've been in touch to evaluate, offer assistance. And again, I'm not going to get into a classified discussion about what we may or may not be discussing.\nQ: A supportive effort needless to say.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Chairman Nunes today refused to definitively rule out that he received the information he announced yesterday on surveillance, that he got that from the White House. So will you rule out that the White House or anyone in the Trump administration gave Chairman Nunes that information?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what he actually briefed the President on, but I don't know why he would come up to brief the President on something that we gave him.\nQ: Well, that's why it was confusing to many of us, so I was wondering --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that that makes sense. I did not sit in on that briefing. I'm not -- it just doesn't -- so I don't know why he would brief the Speaker and then come down here to brief us on something that we would have briefed him on. It doesn't really seem to make a ton of sense. So I'm not aware of it, but it doesn't really pass the smell test.\nHallie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On healthcare, a couple for you. Mark Meadows says -- came out of a meeting and said there is no deal. Does the President acknowledge that this bill appears to be in trouble right now?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that we're going to continue -- I mean, it's not a question of trouble. There was no deal. We weren't asking for a deal. The President --\nQ: You wouldn't call the essential health benefits package a deal?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think for a lot of members it was. And I think some of them stood up and said, Mr. President, we're with you. I think a lot of them said, we're going to go back and think about it. But there was no -- the meeting didn't conclude by saying, \"do we have a deal?\" That's not why we had it. I think for some members this has been --\nQ: No final offer before it is --\nMR. SPICER: No, I think this was a discussion that the President continues to have. I think we have been very, very pleased with the direction it's going in and the number of members who have expressed their support for it. We'll continue that discussion with the Tuesday Group. But the number is growing, the number of members who have shared concerns, and I think that we have been very responsive, as well as Speaker Ryan, to the concerns and ideas that members have expressed from across the spectrum.\nQ: Two quick clarifications. You said that there's only plan A. At this point, is there an acknowledgement that perhaps there does need to be a plan B if this vote doesn't happen tonight?\nMR. SPICER: No. Plan A.\nQ: Okay, then the next follow-up is just, has the President asked Speaker Ryan to delay this vote while he works with some of these members to try to convince them to come on board.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, what's that?\nQ: Did the President asked Speaker Ryan --\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: -- to delay the vote?\nMR. SPICER: Steven.\nQ: I was going to offer you the opportunity to respond to what Leader Pelosi said today. She said that it's a \"rookie mistake\" to set a date for a bill before there's consensus from the Republican caucus. What's your response to that?\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think we have a pretty strong record on the Republican side of getting bills passed, getting things done. And so -- I know that they have a pretty strong record of passing things and telling people that they can read the bill afterwards. I think we have done this the right way, and I think -- we know that we've done it with the support that voters told members and the President that they wanted.\nJonathan.\nQ: And related, if I might.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, of course.\nQ: There are some former White House lawyers who served in the prior administration who say that by tweeting from his official POTUS account this morning a video that was put out on official social media channels, that the President and the White House have violated the anti-lobbying law because they're using money that was appropriated by Congress. Is that a concern you guys appreciate? Is that something that's been talked about here?\nMR. SPICER: It is not. The President -- that is not applicable to the President, no. So there is no -- I believe you're referring to 18 U.S. Code 1913, if I'm correct. (Laughter.) I think we're pretty good on it.\nJonathan.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President wrote a book called \"The Art of the Deal.\" He's considered the ultimate closer when it comes to negotiations. If this deal falls through, if this bill does not pass, would he accept the blame for its failure? And if not, who would?\nMR. SPICER: Let's get to the vote tonight. I'm not going to start -- I think the President has done a phenomenal job, there's no question. And I think when you look at the effort that he's put in, the number of meetings that he's had, and the changes that have been made to the bill, there's no question how hard the President and his team, the Vice President have worked to get this done. And it's in response -- at the end of the day we can't force somebody to vote, but I think, as I mentioned to Hallie and several other folks, I like the direction that this thing is going. I think that we continue to see support go with us.\nWe're not seeing people fall off, we're seeing people come on board. That's a great trajectory to have, and so I like where we're headed.\nQ: Two very quick clarifications on previous answers and then I have a third question. I think the issue was not what the President had done but what White House staffers were doing with their official Twitter accounts. So while the law does not apply to the President it was a question about White House staff.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, so you want me to answer that one?\nQ: Sure.\nMR. SPICER: Let me read for you from 18 U.S. Code 1913. \"The Department of Justice consistently has construed that the Anti-Lobbying Act as limiting the lobbying activities personally undertaken by the President, his aides and assistants with the Executive Office of the President, the Vice President, Cabinet members within their areas of responsibilities, and others confirmed officials appointed by the President responsibility.\"\nSo there's clearly a carve-out for that. Next.\nQ: When you were talking about the Byrd Rule earlier, can we read from your answer that Vice President Pence does not at any point intend to overrule the Senate parliamentarian?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of overrule. You don't overrule. The Senate parliamentarian makes interpretations. It's up to the presiding officer.\nQ: -- right?\nMR. SPICER: I do, but I also understand how the Senate works. And the presiding officer determines -- the Senate parliamentarian has asked for guidance.\nQ: Sure, and if the guidance from the Senate parliamentarian is that something would violate the Byrd Rule, would Vice President Pence --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to answer hypotheticals about what he may do, not on this bill or any other.\nQ: Just finally, CNN reported yesterday that U.S. officials believe that -- are investigating that associates of President Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign. I'm wondering if you can respond to that or say definitely that they did not do so.\nMR. SPICER: So let's actually look at what CNN reported. They reported that anonymous U.S. officials have told them that information indicates that association of the campaign and suspected operatives coordinated, which they admit is not conclusive of anything, is bordering on collusion. The last line of the thing said, \"The FBI cannot yet prove that collusion took place.\"\nI think there's probably more evidence that CNN colluded with the Clinton campaign to give her debate questions than the Trump campaign gave any kind of collusion. So I think when it comes down to that reporting, it is filled with a bunch of subjective terms about this person may have done this, possibly could have done that. And at the end of the story, if you wade to the very bottom it says, \"The FBI cannot yet prove that collusion took place.\"\nSo I've addressed this type of reporting in the past, and this fits right in.\nJohn.\nQ: Without getting too deep in the weeds on exactly what this strategy is in the Senate to get this bill through the Byrd Rule, is the President confident that the strategy that's being developed in the Senate will result in a bill that can pass muster?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: And the President told us several weeks ago that if it looked like the Democrats were going to filibuster Judge Gorsuch, he would encourage Mitch McConnell to invoke the nuclear option. Has the President's position on that changed at all?\nMR. SPICER: The President has not spoken to Senator McConnell yet. I think Senator Schumer, as you know, within the last hour or so came out with his position. I'm sure that after we get through tonight the President will have some kind of conversation with Senator McConnell and discuss Senate strategy. We're not there yet.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Following up on Jordan's question and then I have a follow-up on Hallie's question. How did Chairman Nunes end up at the White House yesterday? This morning he said he invited himself here, but that's sort of an uncommon way to end up here. Can you take us through sort of the tick-tock of what happened?\nMR. SPICER: No. I don't know how he got here. I assume in a car. (Laughter.) But I also don't track him. I don't keep his schedule either.\nQ: You know who he spoke with at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't. He literally gave a press conference as we were starting and saying I'm going to go down to the White House after we brief the press.\nQ: Was this the first time that the White House was made aware of the surveillance that he brought to the President yesterday?\nMR. SPICER: I believe that the information that he shared with the President was new.\nQ: And then the follow-up on healthcare. Is there any sort of plan if the bill does not pass tonight?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: What is the plan B?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's going to pass. So that's it.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Now that you've been briefed -- I know yesterday you hadn't been on everything had just happened -- can you say if the information that Nunes had is the same information that the President said he had that would be revealed this week?\nMR. SPICER: We're not going to -- my understanding, because I was not briefed on the contents of that, was that he spoke generally about what he had seen in these reports that he had been made privy to, but that there was further details he wanted the President to know what he had seen and that it wasn't related to Russia. But he's continuing, as, again -- all of his public comments are that he is going to continue to pursue this and that he'll have further updates later. But I'm not aware of the specific nature of it.\nCecilia.\nQ: Wait, one more question. What will the President's reaction be to Republicans who vote against the healthcare bill tonight? And are they being encouraged the vote their conscience?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think I've addressed this before, but I think the President has made very clear that Republicans in particular have made a commitment to constituents and to the American people that if given the opportunity to have a Republican President, a Republican Senate and a Republican House, that they would enact a repeal-and-replace and put into it a patient-centered healthcare.\nHe believes, as he mentioned during --when he met with the House conference, as he mentioned with the members of the Freedom Caucus today, and I think in several meetings, that this is something that we've talked about. You've taken a bunch of these free votes when it didn't matter because you didn't have a Republican President. And you got to vote for repeal and go back and tell your constituents something like 50 times -- well, this is a live ball now. And this is for real, and we're going to do what we pledged to the American people and keep our word.\nAnd he's made it very clear that part of the reason that he got elected is because he went out and made a series of bold pledges to the American people about what he would do if he were President, and he's acting on those. And he's acting swiftly and boldly with respect to this in particular -- and that he believes that not just him, but that members of the House and the Senate have an obligation to fulfill the promise and the pledge that they made to the American people.\nCecilia.\nQ: Regardless of what happens tonight, will we hear from the President? Will he come out and make a statement?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's going to depend on what time the vote is. So I don't want to commit -- I'm sure in some way, shape or form we'll have some kind of comment.\nQ: And similar to the question you were asked here, but is the President, no matter what happens, prepared to take responsibility for the outcome of this bill?\nMR. SPICER: In what way?\nQ: Whether it succeeds or fails? His name is on it. A lot of people think so.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that in the sense that we've been very clear about this is a priority of ours and we've worked with him. But again, I go back to -- at the end of the day, we can't make people vote. We've done everything we can to listen to them, to incorporate their thoughts, to incorporate their ideas to make the bill as best we can. But it's a balancing act, make no mistake about it, that there's a full spectrum of folks in the House that have disparate desires.\nBut I think we can all commit that this is the one vehicle that's going to repeal something that almost every single Republican that I'm aware of has pledged to do if they were reelected or elected. And I think that there's a desire that -- we understand that not every member is going to find this perfect. That's what happens when you need to get, in this case, 216 votes.\nBut it's the best bill that takes into consideration all of the concerns and all of the goals and all the values -- and I understand that in a lot of cases, some of it isn't a question of the policy, it's a question of the timing and some of the things that people want that are happening in phase three and phase one.\nBut as we've addressed, the Byrd Rule, which is -- to most people, this arcane thing probably even in the House that don't have to deal with it -- in the Senate that deals with whether or not -- and if there is a -- if it is loaded up with things that are stricken, then it doesn't serve us any good.\nI think that we have put together a very comprehensive approach to addressing how to actually repeal and how to actually replace. I think the President walked through with the House Freedom Caucus today several of the administrative acts that Secretary Price would be taking in accordance with the authority that was granted to him by the Obamacare legislation and by some of the actions that Secretary Sebelius took back in 2009.\nThere's a lot of concern among members about some of the sequencing on things, and I think that we have continued to not -- so this isn't just about policy. Some of it's about sequencing and timing. And I think the President and the Vice President and the rest of the team have done a lot to reassure them on the sequencing and how this thing is going to act. So that discussion I think has continued to be very productive to reassure members how this thing is going to happen and take place.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. A moment ago you said that there was some members of the House Freedom Caucus in the meeting today who were \"no's\" who stood up and said, Mr. President, I'm with you. Can you tell us how many of those there were and what their names were?\nMR. SPICER: Not yet. And I'm not trying to be cute about this. I think as we do this -- as we do the whip count, I think as you can imagine, that we've got to make sure that we don't -- that this balancing act -- and you've got to now make sure that certain people don't fall off the end as you pick up certain people. And so we're keeping that vote total rather tight right now. But I feel very buoyed by the direction that we're headed in.\nQ: And can you give us a sense of what specific offer was made? There's been reporting that the final offer was put on the table for these guys. What specific changes did the President offer them today that were new that we haven't seen before?\nMR. SPICER: It's not just changes. As I mentioned to Cecilia, part of this is some of the administrative stuff and making sure that they have reassurances that certain things that Secretary Sebelius enacted when she enrolled the bill -- or, excuse me, enacted the bill that will be acted upon immediately.\nAnd so there was an enumeration of some of those things and a commitment on some of the other aspects of support that would be given for the phase three bill about buying across state lines, increasing HHS -- HSAs. There was a lot of talk about that. And that's where I think a lot of this comes down to right now, especially among those members. They feel very good about the changes that have been made in the manager's amendment and they feel very good. There is some question about the commitment and changes that might take place in the Senate, and so that -- there was a lot of can we count on this when this happens. So I just want to -- some of this is working that way.\nGoyal.\nQ: Thank you very much, Sean. Two questions please. One, as far as 68 countries representing against terrorism or against ISIS at the State Department under the leadership of Secretary of State Tillerson -- there was an advisor to the President of Afghanistan coming here speaking at CSIS. And also, the day before yesterday, at the (inaudible) he was addressing Mr. Rabbani, who is the foreign minister of Afghanistan. What both were saying or addressing to the audience at these two think tanks that unless we control two countries who are financing and training -- Saudi Arabia is financing in the name of charities, and Pakistan is training. So what is the presidential message to this group?\nAt the same time, there is a Mr. Abdel Said, who is wanted by the U.S., $10 million -- there's a bounty on him. And he's openly spewing hatred against the U.S. and India and Pakistan. So where do we go from here?\nMR. SPICER: So, look, Secretary Tillerson is the meeting of -- have been going through this meeting with 68 of those members that are committed to addressing Syria and ISIS. I'm not going to get ahead of the internal discussions that Secretary Tillerson is having related to the administration's review of Syria's policy in particular. But I would stay in touch with the State Department on that.\nJohn.\nQ: The second part of my question please.\nMR. SPICER: Okay.\nQ: As far as President's relation with the Indian American community is concerned, that 40 years it was 1976 when a spiritual leader came from -- all the way from India to New York City, and he wanted to have a parade, Festival of India in New York, but they didn't have any resources or sources, but Mr. Trump that time, Donald Trump, came out and helped the group to go on this festival. But now, candidate Trump was also among the Indian American community celebrating Diwali in New Jersey -- same group who has been now at the White House this weekend, a peaceful prayer and vigil. They're asking the President to come out or meet the Indian American community against hate crimes or somebody from the White House.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we've discussed the nature of hate crimes in the past and we've condemned the act that happened in Kansas earlier this year. Obviously I'm sure that this is a very important issue for them. The President is right now focused in particular on getting Obamacare repealed and replaced, the issue in London -- there's a lot that's occupying his time. And I'm sure that we will continue to monitor that situation as well.\nMara.\nQ: Will he come --\nMR. SPICER: Maybe someday. We'll see.\nQ: I have a question about essential health benefits. The President said to Tucker Carlson that he wasn't going to -- if his people weren't taken care of, he wasn't going to sign anything. And I'm wondering what he says to people who voted for him who relied on the provisions for opioid addiction -- things that were included in those essential health benefits, if they go away.\nMR. SPICER: But -- yeah, I -- respectfully, I think that's a false choice. Again, the problem with Obamacare is it took all of these benefits, mandated that they had to be offered, and what happened is it spiked insurance rates, it spiked deductibles, and choices went away. And the point isn't making a benefit go away or not. And that's why I think it's, respectfully, a false choice. It's actually offering options to people. It's literally like any other service or product that we have here in this country where you can buy what you want. Sometimes it's at a lower price point because that's what you can afford. Sometimes you buy features on a product because you want those features. Sometimes you determine that you don't need -- but people should have choice in the healthcare market just the same way that they do in almost every other industry.\nI mean, that's the point. It's not about giving or taking, it's about the point that they are being mandated in a way -- and that's the point, is that people should buy what they want, and what is appropriate for themselves or their family. I mean that --\nQ: Right now, where do the essential health benefits stand? That they're going to be part of this bill, or still --\nMR. SPICER: I think my understanding is they're part of the House bill.\nQ: They're going to be part of this bill?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, just to follow up on Mara's question. I think part of the inherent question is, a lot of people buy insurance not knowing what they're going to need.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think if you're an older man, you can generally say that you're not going to need maternity care.\nQ: That's possible. But here is the question Mara was suggesting: Opioi0d and drug addiction -- you don't buy your insurance and say, I really need that back-up coverage because I think I'm going to get addicted to painkillers or opioid drugs. So the question is, is the President confident that the kind of choice he has ambitions for would be offered by insurance companies on their own volition?\nMR. SPICER: I think several plans, I'm sure -- I mean, again, you're asking -- I think there's a market for things, but like anything else, I don't think you buy insurance for anything, Alexis, guessing saying, hey, I assume that if my house burns down, I'm going to need to replace all these things. You buy insurance -- that's the whole point of insurance. And I think when people look at it, they're going to buy what they may not need. But they're going to evaluate it, and that's the same thing when you look at a retirement plan, or a car insurance, or any else. You evaluate what your needs are, and then make the decision what's best for you and your family.\nSarah.\nQ: Sean, can you say unequivocally that associates of President Trump did not collude with suspected Russian operatives and coordinate on the release --\nMR. SPICER: So say the first part of it again.\nQ: Can you say unequivocally that associates of Donald Trump --\nMR. SPICER: See, I think this is -- with all due -- and this is -- the way that the term \"associates\" is flown around, I don't understand what that means. If you're talking about employees of the campaign, employees of the transition or in the White House, that's one thing. But the way that this term \"associates\" gets thrown out -- and again, we talked about this yesterday -- you pull out a gentleman who was employed by someone for five months and talk about a client that he had 10 years ago? No, I can't unequivocally say that nobody ever in his past, who may or not have come in contact with him, sat next to him in a plane, who grew up with him in grade school -- because that's, a lot of times, this --\nQ: This gentleman, Paul Manafort, you're referring to was a campaign chairman --\nMR. SPICER: No, I get it. And you're -- I understand who he is. Thank you. I'm well aware of Paul, I read it out yesterday. But the point that I'm making is, when you use a term like \"associate,\" and you use all of these subjective terms, there's a reason that you're doing it, which is because you don't have anything concrete. If you do, come back to me and ask, \"does anyone in the White House,\" \"is anyone in the transition.\" But when you throw out a vague term like that, it's a catch-all. Can you be certain that no one who works for Time Life Turner has ever done anything illegal? I think that's a pretty broad way of casting a net -- or who has visited the building. I mean, that's what you're equivocally saying.\nQ: And also on the question of anonymous sources. I mean, you clearly have an issue with the way that they have been used among the intelligence officials. But people in this White House are often on background, they are often appearing as anonymous sources. Devin Nunes has used an anonymous source to present his intelligence. So why is it acceptable in that case but not in this case?\nMR. SPICER: First of all, there's two issues here. Number one is, what I have a problem with, and specific with the reporting that your networks did yesterday, is it was one subjective term after another. It was associates that may or may not be there. One subjective term after another, with no concrete proof that anything happened. When you use a term like \"associates,\" you don't even put a time frame around it. It's a little bit nebulous at best to suggest that somebody over and over again, making a claim the way you do and the narrative continues without any substantiation. When you're talking about Nunes, there's a reason that someone who's dealing with classified information can't go out into public and reveal certain things, because --\nQ: He said the information wasn't classified.\nMR. SPICER: No, that's not what he said. I don't think he ever said that anything wasn't classified. But there are certain things that the methods --\nQ: He said he was able to talk about it because it was not classified.\nMR. SPICER: No, no. He's able to talk about the subject; he cannot talk about the specifics, would be my suggestion -- that you can't talk about specifics of a case in terms of the sources and methods and the individuals. Because part of what's happened is a lot of the individuals who have been masked or unmasked are supposed to be classified. So just because something has gone into the public domain doesn't make it any less unclassified. That's the problem.\nQ: Sean, the nuclear posture review is commencing with this administration. Can you assure us that everything is on the table, including a lifting of a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, and also developing new nuclear warheads?\nMR. SPICER: I don't have a full readout on that at this point. I'll either get back to you or have someone from the NSC get back to you.\nKatie.\nQ: Sean, you keep saying that there's not a plan B for healthcare. President Trump has repeatedly said that Republicans should just allow Obamacare to collapse because Democrats will own that, and therefore maybe we shouldn't do anything about it, but it's not fair to the American people to do that. Is the reason there's not a plan B is because the President's plan is to allow Obamacare to collapse?\nMR. SPICER: No. The President's plan is to pass the bill tonight, get it on to the Senate, and then sign a bill once it goes through conference. That's the President's plan, and that's why the President has been fighting for it. That's why the President has been trying to make it stronger and stronger every day.\nBut I think he states a very clear reality, which is, if it doesn't do this, then it is a false choice to compare what we're doing with Obamacare because Obamacare is collapsing -- the premiums are skyrocketing, the choices are going down, the deductibles are going up. There is no equivalency. Something is failing, and we're actually trying to get rid of it to help the American people.\nAnd the point the President is making is, the politically expedient answer is to do nothing, but I think for the sake of the American people and the needs that they have in terms of healthcare, I think we owe it to them to do the right thing.\nQ: So a follow-up question: Who is the President holding accountable for a split in the Republican Party not being able to get this bill done, the struggle that it's taking to get the bill to the last minute? Is he holding Republican leadership, Paul Ryan, accountable for bringing a bill to the table without having consensus from the Freedom Caucus? Or is he holding the Freedom Caucus accountable for opposing it?\nMR. SPICER: I think right now we're not focused on blaming, we're focused on getting it done and winning.\nQ: Sean, you've criticized President Obama for the way he sold Obamacare, and there may be some validity to that.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nQ: But candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, and now President Trump have been selling this legislation as coverage for everybody, lower premiums, lower deductibles, and better healthcare. Hasn't he put Republicans on the spot with this legislation by selling it that way?\nMR. SPICER: But it is. So, yes, thank you for the advertisement, I appreciate it. I think --\nQ: Can it do that?\nMR. SPICER: Of course, it can. I will do that. And that's what the point is. But I think that there has been -- A, I think there is some concern, as I mentioned earlier, about the timing. And I think we have continued to allay a lot of those concerns because of the rule that they are. And again, one of the things that is tough to explain to a lot -- or not tough to explain, but just the reality, is that if we don't do it the way that we're going to do it, we need 60 votes. And we're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate for this bill. The Democrats are united in stopping any progress being made on this.\nAnd so I think the point that we've had to make over and over again is, I get it. In a perfect world, if we had 60 votes, we could do this in a very, very different way and have a much more comprehensive legislative strategy, but in the same way that the Democrats use reconciliation, as do we, to undo it. And the reason that it is a three-pronged, three-phase approach is because of the nature that it has to get dealt with.\nAnd I think for a lot of folks, many of them are new to the process, many of them want to see it done in a different way. And I think we are trying to do it in the most responsible way, so that when it gets sent over the Senate, we don't have to have a huge parliamentary fight about what's \"Byrd-able\" or not.\nAnd that's -- while most people don't want to fully appreciate the nuances of that, it's a reality that we have to face if we actually want to get it done. And I think that makes a big, big difference.\nPeter.\nQ: Sean, yesterday when Chairman Nunes was here, we heard his comments. Today, behind closed doors, he apologized to the committee for not coming to them before he came to the press. And then he expressed regret for the way he handled this -- going public and going to the President before speaking to the members of his own committee. So I guess my question is, why was it appropriate? Why does the White House believe it was appropriate for Chairman Nunes to come and give this information to the President regarding an investigation about the President's own associates during the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: Well, two things. One is, it wasn't -- as has been asked before, to ask me why he did something -- he made a decision, he briefed -- hold on, you're getting there. I've seen enough of you, Peter. I know where you were going. (Laughter.)\nBut the reality is, is that he made a decision. He briefed the press first. No one had a problem, by the way, in the press corps getting briefed before anybody else. He went down and he briefed your colleagues before he briefed anybody else. I don't hear too much crying about that. The reality is -- and then he made a statement and said, I'm going to come down to the White House and share this information with the President, as has just been noted. He didn't give us a heads-up. He told us he made an announcement, he said I'm coming down to the White House, asked for time to share this with the President.\nAnd I think part of the reason, to be clear and to your question, is specifically to say that there's a big difference between any discussion about what's going on in Russia and why this intelligence was picked up. His comments yesterday were very clear the intelligence and the information that he picked up had nothing to do with Russia. And I think he felt as though, according to his own words, that he had an obligation to make sure the President knew what he had discovered. That's it, plain and simple.\nQ: So to be clear, though, just because appearances matter on this, doesn't the White House have a concern that it creates the appearance that there was potentially interference by the President that he was included in conversations about the investigation because it was completed?\nMR. SPICER: My concern, to be perfectly blunt with you, is that it's always -- you seem to have an obsession with the process and not the substance. At some point, isn't --\nQ: Isn't the President --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, hold on, hold on.\nQ: The President is the one who wants the conclusion. He asked for it.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that.\nQ: So I'm asking, why didn't he ask for details before it was completed?\nMR. SPICER: Because as Chairman Nunes said -- and again, I'm just going to make it clear -- because he said that he wanted to make it very clear that the discussion and the revelations that he had were not -- did not regard anything to do with Russia, and he wanted the President to understand that.\nBut there seems to be this obsession with the process: how did he get here, when did he go, what was the reaction. At some point, there should be a concern about the substance. That's a very serious revelation that he's made about what happened during the 2016 election with respect to our side and some of the things that happened.\nAnd at some point, I would implore, urge, beg some of you to use some of your investigative skills to look into what actually did happen, why did it happen, what was going on back there, who knew what when. But I think that there should be a similar concern, as opposed to figuring out whether he took a skateboard or a car here to exactly what happened and why it happened. And the reality is, is that whether he briefed us first or he briefed the Democratic members -- and that's up to him to decide -- the substance of what he shared should be troubling to everybody. And that's what I think is the important thing.\nQ: To follow on this thought, I want to ask you -- at CPAC, President Trump said, people \"shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use someone's name.\" He said, it does \"tremendous disservice.\" This is following up on the conversation you started with Sarah earlier. So, I guess, the simple question is -- Chairman Nunes came out; he noted sources that he couldn't create and provide publicly. So why, when it's politically advantageous, is that use of sourcing okay, but when it's politically damaging, it's not okay?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think there's a difference -- he came out and briefed people on what he knew at the time, and said he was literally going to get further briefs and would have further updates. That's a big difference than reporting and making a serious allegation. In fact, he was doing quite the opposite. He was vindicating the President and saying there is something that you need to know about the substance of the allegations that are being made against you. And while that may or may not be the case, because some of what I've seen --\nQ: But if he had not been vindicating him, wouldn't it have been just as important for the President to learn?\nMR. SPICER: Sure. And I think maybe he would have, and then you probably wouldn't have any concern with that, would you?\nQ: My question is to you.\nMR. SPICER: Margaret.\nQ: Following on that, two questions. You said again, the word \"vindicated.\" The President said he felt somewhat vindicated. Did he feel that having Chairman Nunes come down here helped his own credibility?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's reassuring to know that what he discussed -- while, again, the Chairman made it very clear that he's not final in any of his processes, that what he had seen so far gave him grave concern -- or whatever the exact phrase before I get -- but to use the phrase that Chairman Nunes needed to say -- that he said. That it gave him concern and pause for what he had seen, and wanted the President to be aware of the activity that he had seen that occurred during the transition period.\nI think that's an important -- so I think, yes, the President did -- it was helpful for the President to know that the investigation, as he had asked for, was starting to bear fruit. And again, I think the equally important thing to note about yesterday was that part of what Chairman Nunes said was that it had nothing to do with these allegations and narrative about Russia. And I think that is a very, very important narrative to be clear on.\nQ: And are they going to meet again? And after conversations, since they spoke directly, did the President accept Chairman Nunes's finding that there was no wiretapping at Trump Tower, which he said yesterday?\nMR. SPICER: Well, one, I don't think that -- the first one wasn't planned. There's nothing planned for the Chairman to come down again. But second of all, I think I have and the President has very clearly explained that the tweet wasn't to be taken literally in the sense of the word \"wiretap\" -- that he was talking about surveillance in general. And yes, I think that when -- yes, once what Chairman Nunes said is that there was evidence of surveillance that occurred during the election. And I think that is important to note.\nAgain, I think the obsession is with the process of how he got here, and what time he left, and who he briefed first, as opposed to the substance of this issue. But I'm not going to -- all I'll tell you is the public comments that he made to you and your colleagues both here and up on Capitol Hill was that he was very concerned with the surveillance that he had seen and reports of surveillance and individuals who had been masked and unmasked during especially the transition period. I think that should express concern for a lot of individuals.\nQ: Sot the President is confident that Chairman Nunes can continue to lead this investigation, and, in his view, be impartial?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely.\nQ: Because there have been some questions about that, including from Republicans.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nThank you guys very much. Have a great one.\nEND 2:35 P.M.

Smith, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer, FedEx Corp.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123639", "text": "The President. We've got some big truckers here. You guys are the biggest guys in the business, huh? I'm looking around. I read about you in all the magazines. Good. And you're the ones that make more money though, which is—[laughter].\nParticipant. It's supply and demand. [Laughter]\nThe President. That's good. Great. [Laughter] It's great to be with you, and I don't know whose starting it off. Should I start it of? I'll start it off. Okay?\nFirst of all, I want to thank you for your support on health care. That's been great. I know you had a big problem with Obamacare, and everybody does, so welcome to the crowd. But I very much appreciate you being here, and I very much appreciate your support.\nI'm honored to welcome all of the many truckers and the trucking industry leaders to the White House. And I must say, really, you are the leaders. You are the big ones. I'm very impressed I was able to get you. I think it was the White House that was able to get you. [Laughter]\nNo one knows America like truckers know America. You see it every day, and you see every hill, and you see every valley, and you see every pothole in our roads that have to be redone.\nOld Dominion Freight Line, Inc. Chief Executive Officer David S. Congdon. Absolutely.\nThe President. Every town, every forest, from border to border, to ocean to ocean—it's true. It's true. And you love America, and you love the spirit, and we love your spirit. And we want to thank you very much, because—very special people.\nThrough day and night and all kinds of weather, truckers course the arteries of our Nation's highways. You carry anything and everything: the food that stocks our shelves, the fuel that runs our cars, and the steel that builds our cities.\nYou think I wrote that? [Laughter] It's not bad.\nMr. Congdon. You did a good job.\nThe President. Save that. I want to save that paragraph for a book or something. [Laughter] That's beautiful.\nBut America depends on you. And you work very hard for America. Many of you spend weeks away from your families doing what can sometimes be a very difficult and dangerous job, to put it mildly. But you take care of yourselves, you look out for your friends, and you don't stop until the job is done. That's true.\nObamacare has inflicted great pain on American truckers. Many of you were forced to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. You experienced a crippling rise in premiums and a dramatic loss in options. And you just take a look at what's happened to the costs, and it's incredible. You look at what's going on with deductibles, where they're through the roof, so essentially, you don't have it, because hopefully, you'll never have to use it, because you won't have that kind of injury or sickness.\nSo you know the problems, and it's put a lot of the trucking businesses out of business, which is pretty tough. In addition, many union drivers are slated to have their plans taxed to pay Obamacare, and they've been against it for a long period of time. And trucking companies that are considered large employers have to offer Government-mandated health insurance. You have the mandate that just doesn't work for them. You're forced to do things that you don't want to do.\nToday the House is voting to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. We'll see what happens; it's going to be a very close vote. After we repeal and replace Obamacare—and by the way—it's close not because Obamacare is good, it's close for politics. They know it's no good. Everybody knows it's no good. It's only politics, because we have a great bill, and I think we have a very good chance. But it's only politics.\nAfter we repeal and replace Obamacare, we're going to do everything we can to make sure truckers stay busy moving American goods made by American companies and workers. Big difference out there now, don't you think?\nParticipants. Yes. Absolutely.\nThe President. Big difference.\nWe will rewrite our broken Tax Code and fix our terrible trade deals. We will also eliminate job-killing regulations where you guys are so subject to regulations, and we're going to free it up. It's going to be freed up. You're going to be back to business. And we'll make sure America's infrastructure is the best in the world. Right now it's probably the worst it's been in 40 years. I have friends in your business; they say trucking from Los Angeles to New York and back, it's very tough on the trucks—never used to be that way—with the condition of the roads and the highways.\nSo I look forward to hearing from you. We're going to have a long talk, although I'm not going to make it too long because I have to get votes. I don't want to spend too much time with you and then lose by one vote. [Laughter] Then, I'm going to blame the truckers. [Laughter]\nSo—[laughter]. But we're going to talk for a little while, and then I'm going to go back to business. And I appreciate you all being here. And maybe we'll go around the table, just introduce yourself and your company real fast, and we'll leave the press stay because I'm sure they'll be very excited by that.\nAnd let's go.\nMr. Congdon. Okay. I'm David Congdon. I'm the CEO of Old Dominion Freight Line.\nThe President. Good carrier.\nMr. Congdon. We're a less-than-truckload carrier based in North Carolina.\nThe President. That's right.\nMr. Congdon. And we operate 8,000 tractors, 25,000 trailers——\nThe President. Wow.\nMr. Congdon. ——and do about $3 billion in sales; 19,500 employees. The President. Wow, that's fantastic, David. How do you compare size wise with the other big ones?\nMr. Congdon. We're the third largest in the less-than-truckload sector.\nThe President. Who is the largest?\nMr. Congdon. The largest is FedEx Freight.\nThe President. I see, good. And they're here too.\nMr. Congdon. FedEx Freight is here at the table.\nThe President. Where's FedEx Freight?\nFedEx Freight Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer Michael L. Ducker. Here, sir.\nThe President. Very impressive. Oh, you're central casting; look at this guy. [Laughter] Great company.\nJames Burg Trucking Company President and Chief Executive Officer James Burg. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Jim Burg, JBTC Trucking from Macomb County, Michigan, a county you carried well.\nThe President. I did.\nMr. Burg. First time since 2004.\nThe President. Love that State. [Laughter] We're bringing back a lot of jobs; you see what's happening.\nMr. Burg. Started the company with one truck in 1984. Built it up to a 90-truck operation. We're a flatbed carrier that hauls steel and construction materials within Michigan and the Midwest.\nThe President. Fantastic. Say hello to Michigan for me.\nMr. Burg. I certainly will.\nThe President. We like that sound: Breaking news, Donald Trump has won Michigan. [Laughter] But you know what, we're doing even better now because we've brought back—Ford, you know, is moving back in, and General Motors, they're going to be doing a lot of new plants and thousands and thousands of people coming back into Michigan.\nMr. Burg. We'll be hauling the steel for those plants.\nThe President. I know you will, I know you will. Good. Thank you very much.\nJet Express, Inc., President Kevin W. Burch. Mr. President, it's an honor to be here. My name is Kevin Burch. I'm President of Jet Express Trucking out of Dayton, Ohio, a truckload carrier. I'm also this year's chairman of the board of American Trucking Association.\nThe President. Good.\nMr. Burch. Originally from Flint, Michigan, we were involved with handling a lot of the water, and appreciate all your support in helping us——\nThe President. We just gave a check for $100 million to Flint.\nMr. Burch. Absolutely. Born and raised there. The President. Think of that whole horrible deal. That's great political leadership. What a disaster. In order to save a fee, they went to bad water and spent a fortune on pipes and infrastructure. Anyway, we're helping out Flint.\nMr. Burch. We're primarily a truckload carrier for General Motors, around 300 loads a day just in time, right to assembly points. Thank you very much\nThe President. They are expanding as you know——\nMr. Burch. Yes, they are.\nThe President. ——in this country. The rest of their expansion I don't care too much about—it doesn't matter—but I don't think they'll be doing too much.\nOkay, that's is my guy. Go ahead.\nWisconsin Motor Carriers Association President Neil Kedzie. Mr. President, it's an honor to be here. Neil Kedzie. I'm the president of the Wisconsin Motor Carriers Association. We represent the trucking industry in Wisconsin. There are 50 associations across the entire country within the umbrella under the American Trucking Association. We have over 1,100 members in our association. There are over 15,000 trucking companies in Wisconsin.\nAnd prior to that time, I spent 18 years in the Wisconsin State legislature. And also, Reince Priebus and I are graduates from UW-Whitewater——\nThe President. Good.\nMr. Kedzie. ——and have been buddies for about 20 years ourselves. So it's an honor to be here, sir.\nThe President. Thank you. He's doing a good job, good job.\nKenan Advantage Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dennis A. Nash. Mr. President, Dennis Nash. I'm the founder and CEO of the Kenan Advantage Group, based in Canton, Ohio. We're in the tank truck hauling business, primarily fuels and chemicals. We have about 10,000 drivers located in 38 States.\nThe President. That's great. Great job.\nMr. Nash. And I think we have a mutual friend maybe—or had a mutual friend in Charlie Eichholtz.\nThe President. Absolutely. Absolutely. He's great.\nMr. Nash. Yes. His daughter is still running the company, but Charlie was a great friend.\nThe President. Great guy. Say hello. Great guy.\nU.S. Xpress Enterprises Chief Executive Officer Eric Fuller. Eric Fuller, CEO of U.S. Xpress Enterprises out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. We're the second largest privately held truckload carrier. We have about 7,000 tractors, 10,000 employees.\nThe President. That's great. Good job.\nCRST International, Inc. Chairman John M. Smith. John Smith from CRST in Cedar Rapids. Second generation. My dad started the business. Third generation is coming in, so we hope to keep it going. I would like to invite you to Cedar Rapids. We also do a lot of training and bringing in the new blood to the industry, and I think it's quite unique, and we would love to get you out there. The President. Well, Cedar Rapids was very good to me. You know that, right? [Laughter] So I like Cedar Rapids. Say hello to the people.\nMr. Smith. I will.\nAmerican Trucking Associations President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Spear. Mr. President, I'm Chris Spear. I'm president and CEO of the American Trucking Association. Thanks to you and Mr. Vice President for hosting us here today.\nWe have one in 16 jobs in this country, and in 29 States, truck drivers are the number-one job. So for the 7.3 million employees in the industry, 3.5 million drivers, we have 12 of them here today that have 29.4 million accident-free miles. Safety is our number-one priority. And obviously, we are here to help you get the job done. We would love to see Obamacare replaced. We love the bill. We want to bring costs down. We want to make our lives and our families better. And we believe this is the proposal to get the job done.\nThe President. It's a great, great proposal. And you're going to have competitive bidding. You're going to have those insurance companies going wild for your companies. And you'll be able to pick the right plan and the right doctor, which as you know, was a big lie. But you're going to have the plan and the doctor, yes. And I think we're doing well. We'll find out in about 3 hours.\nMr. Spear. Absolutely.\nThe President. I don't know why I'm with you. [Laughter] But we're going to find out.\nThat's all right. Thanks, Chris.\nMr. Spear. Thank you.\nCrete Carrier Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer Tonn M. Ostergard.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123606", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:15 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. There's a lot going on today, so I'm going to keep this on the briefer side.\nThis morning, the President announced the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The last administration spent eight years delaying this enormous investment in American energy independence. President Trump is moving this project forward in just eight weeks. And just as he promised, it's an even better deal for the American people than before he took office. This project will directly generate an estimated 16,100 jobs, according to the State Department -- all without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\nIn many ways, this project represented everything that was wrong with the infrastructure permitting of the United States. TransCanada spent an incredible amount of resources attempting to comply with government regulations, only to be denied and delayed for political reasons. But the days of pointless government bureaucracy holding up progress and production have ended. By simply getting excessive, duplicative regulations out of the way, we can make infrastructure projects more attractive -- a more attractive prospect for private investors, and encourage even more projects like this one.\nImmediately following the announcement by TransCanada, the President announced that Charter Communications has committed to investing $25 billion here in the United States and hiring an additional 20,000 American workers over the next four years.\nCharter Communications is truly an example of how American leadership can turn a downturn entity into an amazing success.\nFive years ago, Charter Communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy. Today, thanks to hard work and great leadership of Chairman and CEO Tom Rutledge, it is the fastest-growing television, Internet, and voice company in the nation. And, most importantly, as Charter grew, American jobs grew, as they brought back many jobs that had previously been shipped overseas. Today, Charter is also committed to completely ending its offshore call centers, basing 100 percent of them in the United States.\nTogether, the TransCanada and Charter Communications announcement demonstrate the new economic model of what the President called The American Model. By slashing job-killing regulations and reducing government burdens and lowering taxes, we will make it easier for all businesses to grow right here at home, generating jobs and boosting our economy by getting government out of the way.\nFollowing these big announcements, the President had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. He was joined by Speaker Paul Ryan -- I'll get to in a second on that. Later in the afternoon, the President will host a Greek Independence Day celebration. And as I mentioned yesterday, at 4 o'clock he will meet with about two dozen Medal of Honor recipients to honor Medal of Honor Day, which is technically tomorrow. He's honored to be hosting these great men and women of our Armed Services, the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known.\nAnd obviously, later today, the House will be voting on the American Health Care Act. The current vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. The President has been working the phones and having in-person meetings since the American Health Care Act was introduced. He's left everything on the field when it comes to this bill. The President and congressional Republicans promised the American people that they would repeal and replace this broken system.\nObamacare's Washington-driven, one-size-fits-all plan had seven years to prove its case, and look what it's left us with:\nSkyrocketing premiums -- on average, premiums for Obamacare benchmark plans increased 25 percent in 2017. Unaffordable deductibles -- the two most popular Obamacare health plans have average deductibles equivalent to 10 percent and 6 percent of the median American household income. With these high deductibles, many people have, technically, insurance, but nothing that they can afford to use. Fewer choices -- one in five Americans have only one insurer offering Obamacare through exchanges. And, of course, higher taxes.\nKey conservative groups like the Tea Party Express and the American Conservative Union have added themselves to a long list of organizations expressing their support for the American Health Care Act because they know it's our chance, after the American people have spent years suffering, to finally repeal and replace the nightmare of Obamacare. The President looks forward to seeing the House Republicans join with these influential voices and vote in favor of the American Health Care Act.\nThe President, as I mentioned, had Speaker Ryan come up here and visit with him to update him on the bill. They are continuing to discuss the way forward on this. The Speaker is updating him on his efforts. As I mentioned to you, the President has been working throughout the week on this, calling early -- starting early in the morning and working till late at night, calling with members, visiting members. By our count, over 120 members have personally had a visit, call, or meeting here at the White House in the past few days. This is an extraordinary feat. The President and his team have committed everything they can to making this thing happen. And the Speaker is going to continue to update him on the way forward.\nFinally, a few administrative notes here at the end. Yesterday, senior-level United States and Israeli delegations concluded four days of intensive talks with a particular focus on concrete, near-term measures to improve the overall climate in order to advance the prospects of a genuine and lasting peace between Israel and Palestine.\nThe United States delegation was led by Jason Greenblatt, Special Representative for International Negotiation, and included representatives of the NSC and the Department of State.\nA principal focus of the discussion was specific measures that could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza, allowing the Palestinians to more fully realize their economic potential.\nThe two delegations also discussed Israeli settlement construction. The fact that both governments dedicated such senior delegations for so many days reflects the close cooperation between these countries and the importance that both assign to this vital task.\nLast night, the President announced his intention to nominate several key additional people to the administration, including Althea Coat-zee to be Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration; William Francis Hagerty IV to be ambassador to Japan; Robert Sumwalt III to be a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.\nAnd also this morning, of note, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia upheld the President's revised executive order protecting the nation from foreign people who seek to do us harm into the United States. We're pleased with this ruling, which found the plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. As the court correctly notes in its opinion, the President's order falls well within his legal authority to protect the nation's security. We're confident the President's fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the system -- court system.\nIn terms of the schedule for this weekend, the President will spend a working weekend here in Washington, and we'll update you with further details regarding his schedule.\nWith that, I'll get to your questions. Steve.\nQ: Sean, is it your understanding that you don't have the votes to pass the healthcare legislation? Is that the message that Speaker Ryan delivered today? And if so, what lessons do you draw from this process?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the Speaker is currently having a conversation with him to talk about where that vote count stands. He's working with the members of -- you know the President made a sell. They had the Tuesday Group here. There were 17 members here; 16 walked out as a \"yes.\" I think we've had a group of members that we've continued to have a conversation with and try to make -- frankly, at this point, it's not a question of negotiating anymore. It's understanding the greater good that's at hand.\nThe President understands this is it. We had this opportunity to change the trajectory of healthcare to help improve -- put a healthcare system in place and to end the nightmare that Republicans have campaigned on called Obamacare. I noted yesterday it was the seventh-year anniversary of Obamacare. We have an opportunity to make sure that was the last one, and the question is, do members realize this opportunity.\nThere's no question in my mind at least that the President and the team here have left everything on the field. He has called every member that had a question or concern, tried to, to the extent possible, take into consideration ideas that would strengthen the bill. And it's now going to be up to the members of the House to decide whether or not they want to follow through on the promise to that.\nBut we're going to continue to work with the Speaker and the leadership there to see where the votes are. We're getting closer and closer, but you need to get to 216. And they're starting four hours of debate. I expect a vote somewhere around 3:30-4 o'clock hour. We'll see where we go.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. We're hearing that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell wanted to do a clean repeal and then replace over time. In retrospect, would that have been a better approach? And in general, do you think Paul Ryan has handled this well?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that that's entirely the case. I know that this was a joint effort. This is something that the House determined in terms of the three-pronged approach that we had. So I don't know that I necessarily agree with the assessment of how that happened.\nQ: And, in general, is the White House happy with how Paul Ryan has handled this?\nMR. SPICER: I think the Speaker has done everything he can. He's worked really closely with the President. I think at the end of the day -- I said this yesterday -- you can't force people to vote. But I think we've given them every single reason to fulfill every pledge that they've made, and I think this is the right thing to do.\nMaggie. I don't want you to live-Tweet this thing.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. What is the White House's view if this does not pass and there aren't the votes? What does this mean going forward for other pieces of the President's agenda -- tax reform being the big one?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I've said it before, I don't think you can tie any of these together. That's just not -- I think there's a huge appetite for tax reform. And I'm not trying to juxtapose anything to do with today's vote or not. I think it will be great to see it put forward. The President has put a lot of time and effort into this, and I think he's made a strong case as to why this has to happen, and I think we've worked with the House.\nIf we don't get -- regardless of what happens today -- and I still feel optimistic that the Speaker and the President and the Vice President -- we've got a team that's been up on the Hill most of today -- they're going to continue to try to get every vote they can. But that doesn't mean -- whether it's immigration or tax reform, there's still a huge appetite out there.\nQ: Just to be clear, I mean, if this fails today, is the President done with healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: So negative. (Laughter.)\nQ: That's what we're hearing.\nMR. SPICER: That's what you're hearing? Well, I haven't heard that yet, so why don't we continue with a very positive, optimistic Friday. The sun is coming out. (Laughter.) I feel really good. So we're going to continue to work as late as we can to get the votes. And as I said, the upside is that we continue to pick up votes, people continue to say that they want to -- the question is, can we get to 2016.\nBut make no mistake about it, the President made it clear last night -- this is it. You have an opportunity to do what you've told the American people, the commitment that we as a party have made, but this is your chance to do what we've done. We've listened, we've incorporated, we've updated in every way possible.\nI don't think -- when you look at legislative efforts, I think the President has given it his all. And I think it shocked a lot of people, frankly, how very, very detail-oriented, how personal it was for him -- calling members as early as 6:00 a.m. in the morning and going to 11 o'clock at night the last several nights, sitting down, meeting after meeting with them, coming back and revising it, having his team back and forth. Everything is out there.\nAnd I think each of these members needs to make the decision, whether or not they believe that they've -- at some point, you can only do so much, is what I would honestly tell you. And I think everything that we could possibly do to listen to members, to get their concerns in this piece of legislation, to make it as strong as possible for the American people has been done.\nQ: But is the President comfortable then with Obamacare continuing? And what does he say to his supporters?\nMR. SPICER: No, he's not. I mean, of course, he's not.\nQ: I mean, they voted for him with the promise that he would repeal this.\nMR. SPICER: I mean, I'm not even sure where to start with that. No, he's not, which is why he's literally put as much effort as he has into repealing this. But he's made it clear that this is our moment, this is our opportunity to do it, but it is now up to members to make that decision whether or not they want to be part of this effort to repeal Obamacare. And if they don't -- and I think for a lot of the -- you saw the President's tweet this morning -- I think for a lot of these members who life is as important as well, this is your opportunity. But it's ultimately them that have to go down in the floor and cast that vote. And I think we've been able to cast a bunch of votes over the past couple years when you knew a President wouldn't sign it. You have a President that's going to sign the bill if you pass it. And now is that time.\nZeke.\nQ: Some months ago at the Republican National Convention, the President said -- \"I alone can fix it.\" Throughout the entire campaign, his message to his voters, the American people, was, he's a businessman, he knows how to get deals done, he knows how to break the gridlock in Washington, he's the \"closer\" is what you said earlier this week. If this vote does go down, what does this say about the President? Is the President humbled by this process? And will he readjust -- how will he readjust the administration going forward?\nMR. SPICER: Let's not -- like I said to Jill, I'm still optimistic. I feel like we're continuing to work hard. But at the end of the day, you can't force somebody to do something. I think there's nobody that objectively can look at this effort and say the President didn't do every single thing he possibly could, with his team, to get every vote possible. And I think that's why I still feel good about this.\nBut we are where we are, and members have got to make that decision for themselves. This is the final hour to make that decision.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, is it under any consideration to pull the bill at all between now and then?\nMR. SPICER: You guys are so negative.\nQ: Well, there's reports out there that --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. But there are reports out there -- the Speaker and the President are talking now. The Leader and the Whip are doing their vote counts. The debate is ongoing. We're going to continue -- we are proceeding with a 3:30 p.m. vote as scheduled.\nJohn.\nQ: Take me through some of the -- if you don't mind -- the thinking yesterday when the bill was pulled and then the President had made the decision -- or his team, they went to the Hill saying, there's going to be a vote today. At what point did he make that calculation? Why did he make that calculation? Can you bring us through some of that thinking?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things. One is, I think we wanted to be as open as possible with the vote. Having it on the current trajectory last night, it was going into the wee hours of the morning, and I don't think that that -- for all that we've talked about, that wasn't the appropriate way to vote. I think we decided to work with the House and ask that they postpone and make sure that it was done in the light of day.\nBut I think that he's had enough discussions. And it is not about improving the deal anymore. I think he has taken into consideration every member's thoughts and concerns, and relayed those to the House. And I think to the extent that this balance of trying to get to 216, in this case, is such that there are some people that come in with ideas and say, if you do that to get your vote, I'm going to give up 26, or to get these three, I'm going give up 12. And I think we have struck the right balance right now and incorporated it, and it's the strongest possible bill. But he's going to continue to work as hard as he can until the very end.\nCharlie.\nQ: How important is a live vote to the White House and to the President to see who's on the side and who's not?\nMR. SPICER: We've seen the whip counts. Mr. Scalise has done a phenomenal job with Leader McCarthy of -- we know where the vote count stands. So we don't need a live vote to tell us where the votes are. People have been pretty straightforward with where they are and what their outstanding issues are.\nQ: The President and the Speaker are meeting right now. Do you know -- can you tell us anything about the character of that meeting, or what exactly they're looking at going forward?\nMR. SPICER: Well, they're discussing, they're not looking. They're sitting down and talking about where it stands, some of the outstanding issues, and whether they're onesies or twosies or fives -- what are the concerned and outstanding issues of some of the blocs and some of the individuals, and having a discussion on that.\nAnita.\nQ: If the bill doesn't pass --\nMR. SPICER: There's somebody that's going to ask when it passes, and you can --\nQ: Okay, well, do you want to have a briefing right after the vote?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Okay. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: All right, score one for you. (Laughter.)\nQ: If the bill doesn't pass, does the President still have confidence in the Speaker?\nMR. SPICER: I think he answered that question earlier today.\nQ: Well, does he think that he should step down if it doesn't get a vote?\nMR. SPICER: He answered that question earlier, and he said he did. So, asked and answered.\nQ: And then, logistically today, after the vote, whatever happens, how will we get a response from you all?\nMR. SPICER: Electronically or verbally, but one of the two.\nPeter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. This is the President's first foray into, let's say, the sausage-making process, so to speak. Has he reflected at all on the experience? I mean, how does he feel it differs from, for example, negotiating a real estate deal, a business deal? Is it more complicated? Is it trickier? What's his feeling about this?\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll have plenty of time to reflect on it after we do this, so I know that -- I'll just leave it at that for now.\nKristen.\nQ: Thanks. Without prejudging the outcome of the vote --\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- does the President in any way regret pursuing healthcare first, given how complicated it has been?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think if you think about it legislatively, in order to maximize -- and I know for most people it doesn't make a ton of sense, but the savings that you achieve through the first reconciliation of healthcare, which we're doing through the 2017 budget process, which still continues, allows us to utilize the savings in that process to maximize additional tax reform measures that will start in the FY2018 reconciliation process.\nSo while that sounds like a ton of inside-baseball gobbledygook, the reality is, is that in order to maximize tax reform both on the corporate side, to make our businesses more competitive and to give individuals, especially middle-class Americans, more tax relief -- doing this in that way maximizes the amount of savings that you can use for the second reconciliation package, which would be tax reform. Doing it the first way, you can do -- but again, you're not going to achieve the full potential that you could if you did it the way that is happening now.\nBut that being said, I mean, it's not a question of -- we all knew how big this was -- it's one-fifth of the economy -- and what it took. The issue is, is that I think the disparate interests that are there, and some of the process-explaining, if you will -- the understanding -- the way that this is happening, and I think, legislatively, it's complicated. And for a lot of folks that just understand, why can't you do it all in one fell swoop? What's the Byrd Rule? What's reconciliation? Why do you have to do it in three phases? I think, for a lot of people, that is a little bit complicated to understand.\nAnd it's not just a question of understanding. I think one of the other things that the President and the team have found is that there's a lot of issues where people are wondering, well, if I vote for this how can I guarantee that I get something in phase two -- which is the administrative pieces that Secretary Price would institute.\nAnd then third is -- well, you know, the legislative things that will take 60 votes, they complete the overall package -- you know, how do I have -- and so there's a lot of -- the comprehensive nature of this makes it very complicated. And I think that's a lot different. Normally, you have one bill that sails through, and it deals with all of these things, and you can roll it all in. If someone has an amendment, you add it in. In this process, we're having to have all these one-off discussions about, you know, will the Senate accept this if you put it in; if you put it in, will they -- not only will they accept it, but will the Byrd Rule take place and kick out the whole thing. That complicates this probably like nothing else.\nQ: Understood. Just to put a fine point on it, though, was it his initial ask to do healthcare first, or did House Speaker Paul Ryan say, I think this is --\nMR. SPICER: I think was something that, during the transition, we sat down and gamed out in coordination with the House in terms of what should go first and why. But again, it's not a question of just what should go first, it's a question of if you don't do it first, do you lose some of the potential in savings that you would achieve through the second reconciliation.\nQ: Wouldn't it have been wiser to try to work with the Freedom Caucus, for example, on something like infrastructure reform to build up some goodwill with that caucus, and then come back to something more complicated?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think -- look, Kristen, we've talked about this since 2010. Every Republican, with the exception of probably a handful, has campaigned from dog catcher on up that they would do everything they could to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I think to get in and say, hey, you should have done something else wouldn't be fair to the American people who have said, okay, I'll vote for you but I want you to fulfill this pledge.\nQ: And just finally, does the buck stop with him on this?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean -- like I said earlier, you can't force someone to vote a certain way. I think, in the sense that has he done every single thing, has he pulled out every stop, has he called every member, has he tweaked every tweak, has he done every single thing he can possibly, and used every minute of every day that's possible to get this thing through, then the answer is yes. Has the team put everything out there? Have we left everything on the field? Absolutely.\nBut at the end of the day, this isn't a dictatorship, and we've got to expect members to ultimately vote to -- you know, how they will according to what they think. But I think they're -- as the President made clear, they're the ones who have to go back and answer to their constituents why they didn't fulfill a pledge that they made.\nQ: Non-healthcare question for you. Regarding these documents that Devin Nunes says show incidental intelligence collection of identifying information about people associated with the Trump campaign, can you categorically rule out that Chairman Nunes received or was alerted to these documents from someone at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of where he got the documents from. I don't know.\nQ: Can you rule out that it came from the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I can't -- I don't know where he got them from. He didn't state it. So I don't have anything for you. And so I cannot say anything more than I don't know at this point.\nCecilia.\nQ: So if the President has done everything he can possibly do, and the Speaker has done everything he can possibly do, the team has put everything on the table, who is to blame right now for this hold-up, in your eyes?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, let's wait and see how this thing -- I'm not assigning blame.\nQ: Well, but you wanted a vote even last night or this morning, so there is a stall. So from last night to this morning --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, we did want a vote last night, and I think, as I have mentioned, as we got into the evening hours, the idea wasn't to bury this at 12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m. in the morning.\nQ: Initially, you were asking for one yesterday, and there was a statement from your press office that asked for one this morning.\nMR. SPICER: No, no -- and I'm not backing away from that. We wanted a vote yesterday. But as the process went on, we realized that that vote would occur in -- probably, actually, into today, in terms of like calendar-wise, and that doing it at 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m. in the morning was not something that would be in keeping with what we had promised.\nQ: So who is to blame for the stall right now? Is it the Freedom Caucus? Is it --\nMR. SPICER: I think it's not a blame. Right now, it's a question of getting all these members together and dealing with all -- I mean, you've seen the activity. You've seen the members go back and forth. Right now, we're still in that active discussion phase with trying to figure out who we can get on board and whether or not we can move forward.\nBut this is -- we're not there yet.\nQ: But you put this ultimatum out there. Is the President, right now, still confident that he can see this bill through -- that you will repeal and replace Obamacare?\nMR. SPICER: The President is confident that we have done every single thing possible, made the case, updated it, added and done everything to listen to the concerns and to do everything that fulfills the promises that we and members have made with the American people.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Without prejudging the outcome of the vote today, but focusing on your comments and the President's, saying this would be a vote against life if people vote against it --\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: -- several Republican members said they did not want the vote on Planned Parenthood in this particular bill. Congressman John Faso of New York was particularly outspoken. Did anything come up in the negotiation or from the White House saying they guarantee a separate vote on Planned Parenthood and leave it out of the bill?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of that, John. I'm not aware that that happened.\nQ: The White House -- from your tone and the President's, the White House wanted the Planned Parenthood vote in?\nMR. SPICER: I'd have to go back and look at -- there's a lot of discussions that go on. I honestly can't remember how or when that came up.\nQ: The other thing I wanted to ask was that the last two members who announced they were no -- Chris Smith and Frank LoBiondo, Republicans of New Jersey -- both cited the number of Medicaid recipients in their district as their premier reason. Congressman LoBiondo said in three counties, 30 percent of his constituents were on Medicaid, and he wanted no damage. Was there anything discussed on Medicaid? Was it on the table in the negotiations?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I know that that there was a discussion about the expansion of Medicaid and some of the work requirements with respect to able-bodied Americans who are receiving that. But I would say this, John -- one of the things that -- not member-specific to either of the members from New Jersey -- is that members have to understand that the current system is unsustainable. So if you vote no today, then what is your alternative, and what do you want?\nBecause right now there's a lot of folks that have said they're going to vote no, which is their prerogative, but at the end of the day, the current Obamacare system will collapse on its own. And so the question that they have to ask themselves or that they are going to be asked by their constituents is, then what is your alternative? Because right now this is the choice that will save the system. The other choice is to do nothing, and that will -- that is going to collapse the system.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The stock market has been largely looking at this as a proxy for how you're going to do on your tax cut proposal. Would you be able to say what the lessons learned here are about how this was handled that might apply to the tax cut proposal?\nMR. SPICER: Look, Eamon, I've discussed this earlier. I'm not going to start getting a \"lessons learned\" while we're in the middle of debate of a current bill. We'll have plenty of time -- if you want to stop by over the weekend, we can talk about -- (laughter) -- to sit down with you on that. But again, we're not -- right now we're focused on getting the votes. The House has a vote scheduled. That's what our focus is -- not to figure out -- we'll have plenty of time for that.\nJen.\nQ: Is the President going to just simply wash his hands of this today if this doesn't go his way?\nMR. SPICER: Look, we're not -- the President is going to wash his hands several times, but I don't know -- (laughter).\nQ: The central campaign promise of the President of the United States --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and so what -- I get it. So slow down. Let's turn on C-SPAN and all watch this together, and then we can discuss what happened.\nJen.\nQ: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was talking this morning about doing tax reform by the August recess. Do you think that that's a reasonable timeline? And why the rush? Are there any lessons learned from this healthcare debate?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think tax reform is something that we've talked about. There's plenty of time. I think it's a goal, and I think it's an ambitious one and I think it's one that we're going to try to stick to. But let's get by today, and then we'll lay it out.\nBut I think tax reform is something that the President is very committed to. You've seen him very publicly in the last couple of open events talk about how excited he is to move on once this is done to tax reform. Because he understands both sides of this -- that the business piece of this -- we are so uncompetitive when it comes to our other worldly competitors in terms of our tax rate, and yet when we have these discussions about keeping companies from either shipping jobs overseas or growing -- bringing back jobs to America, the two things that come up over and over again are our tax rate and our regulatory system.\nAnd I think he understands that on the tax front, we can be a lot more competitive with the rest of the world in growing American jobs here at home and, frankly, expanding manufacturing if we lower that, but also that the American middle class desperately needs and wants a tax break, and I think the more that we can do with that -- so this is something that I think we're going to be continuing to work on, and we'll have more on that later.\nTrey.\nQ: Sean, how much credit will the President take for the outcome of this healthcare bill?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you to like the last eight people. Let's see where we go from here.\nQ: Quick follow-up?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Is the White House still as confident as they were earlier in this week, and is the President still as confident as he was earlier in the week that this healthcare bill will pass?\nMR. SPICER: I would suggest to you it's -- my answer that I said to Kristen is that we are confident that we have done everything, and it is now up to voters.\nThe President -- we -- the President called for a vote, and respectfully -- obviously, it's not up to us, but the reason that he asked Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy to call for a vote is we've done everything. We've done every single thing that -- every meeting, every call, every discussion, every idea has been out there, adjudicated, listened to. And I think that now is the time for the vote. And so we're a couple hours away, and let's see where we go.\nQ: -- level of confidence remain?\nMR. SPICER: I think in the sense of what we did, yes.\nPeter.\nQ: Sean, the President can order every surveillance transcript that mentions himself or his associates in regards to Russia for the investigation that he called for to be brought to his desk at any time. Has he done that?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: So yesterday you were asked specifically -- you said that the concerns should be less about the process and more about the substance. I asked because that would be one way to get directly to the substance.\nOn the substance, Devin Nunes said initially that he -- there was evidence that \"clearly showed that the President-elect and his team were at least monitored.\" Then today he said --, asked if Trump or his associates were monitored or mentioned, he said, we don't know. We won't know until we actually receive all the documentation.\nThe President said he's somewhat vindicated. So given the fact that Devin Nunes doesn't actually know if the President was monitored or whether he was even mentioned, what is he vindicated by?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that there has been an acknowledgement that there are documents out there showing that people were surveilled or monitored to some degree.\nQ: They could have exclusively been foreigners, Devin Nunes concedes.\nMR. SPICER: Devin Nunes also made it clear that he's going to have a hearing later next week with several members of the intelligence community and calling others back. And so let's wait and see --\nQ: Well, what is the President vindicated by?\nMR. SPICER: The President said he felt somewhat vindicated because I think that there is an acknowledgement that he's -- that as we proceed down this discussion, it continues to show that there was something there, and that despite the constant discussion about the process --\nQ: But he said we don't -- we won't know.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, Peter. I understand. I get this is\n-- I understand that. And he also said that he's going to have a hearing and he's going to call the people back, and he's waiting for the documents. So let's wait and let that process evolve.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. A couple questions. First about Keystone. What changed? It seemed like it took forever in covering the Obama administration for this thing to finally get over the finish line. It never did. And relatively quickly -- less than 65 days in -- it's finally made its way over the finish line. What changed, especially with respect to the State Department's view of the Keystone XL pipeline?\nAnd is it your opinion that it would be good to hear from the President -- win, lose, or draw -- after what we learned today vis-а-vis healthcare reform?\nMR. SPICER: So, simply put, on Keystone, it was a priority. I mean, the President came in, he signed an executive order on it. He had talked about it during the campaign and he made it a priority. He made it a priority for his team here at the White House to get it done -- not only the jobs but incorporating U.S. steel and -- there was a lot of things.\nBut I don't think it's any simpler than he made it a priority for him, his team, this administration, the Department of State, and others -- and that's it. He recognizes the importance of that to both energy and to jobs and our economy, and simply got it done. And I'll leave it up to the President, once we go forward, to see how it goes.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, as a dealmaker, why does the President feel that this take-it-or-leave-it approach is the right one on healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think he has done -- I mean, at some point you've listened to everybody, you've gotten all other ideas, you've gone back and forth, you have incorporated them, you've assuaged them in some way, shape, or form; you've updated the bill -- and a lot of times, it's the same people coming back over and over again. And you go, okay, I've listened to you, I've taken your ideas. At some point, we either have a deal or we don't.\nAnd I think that's where the President finally drew the line and said we've been having this discussion, we've had the meetings, and we've done everything possible to address the concerns and ideas and opinions that people have brought up. And I mean, I don't think you can say it any simpler. I think he has done every single thing possible, and you end up, at some point, finding yourself going around and around and saying, okay, let's just -- let's call the vote.\nQ: But isn't there a political cost to a collapse, potentially?\nMR. SPICER: I think that, at some point, there's a political cost to dragging this out, as well, and saying, let's just keep letting it go. And I think that's where -- you know, we came to a decision that it had gotten as far as it can go.\nKaitlan.\nQ: If there's a collapse, though, isn't there a cost that the President will, at some point, have to pay for? If it's either --\nMR. SPICER: In terms of what?\nQ: The collapse that you have been predicting --\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that -- look, remember -- look, this is --\nQ: Besides the upcoming election in 2018, I'm talking about economic impact, all the impact on the states -- there will be a cost.\nMR. SPICER: I get it, and I think that we'll have to look at the landscape. But at some point -- you know, I think right now Democrats made a decision during this debate that they wanted to stick by Obamacare. I think, at some point -- the President has talked about this -- that this is going to collapse. And let's see where this thing heads, but I think, right now, we have a plan on the table that allows for a solution that will address all of the concerns that, frankly, were initially brought up as far as what the Affordable Care Act was supposed to do.\nKaitlan.\nQ: So if you know what the vote counts are right now, and there's no discussion of pulling the healthcare bill, and it gets closer to 3:30 p.m. and you still don't have the votes, why vote?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to discuss our strategy. I mean --\nQ: But you see what I'm saying, right?\nMR. SPICER: I do.\nQ: If you know what the votes are and you know that you don't have the votes for it to pass, why vote?\nMR. SPICER: I understand your question. I'm just not going to comment on our strategy. I think the President and the Speaker are going to have a discussion about where those votes are and what some of the members needs are, and we'll take it from there.\nAthena.\nQ: You talked about all the work that the President and his team have put into this -- the early-morning calls, late calls. The other day, one of the members of Congress who was here to meet with the President -- Congressman McHenry -- called -- said, we're bringing him to \"the closer.\" You embraced that nickname from the podium. Whatever happens today, do you still feel comfortable calling the President \"the closer\" when it comes to deal-making on all this?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think I said to Christian and a couple others, I think he has done everything possible. There is no one, either on Capitol Hill or any honest observer of what's happened, that doesn't recognize the extraordinary feats. But at some point, as I've mentioned, this isn't a one-on-one negotiation. This is -- you know, you have to get to 216.\nAnd I don't -- I think part of this question is to go to some of those \"no's\" and ask them, what is the reason and what would you do? And the probably is, is that, as I've mentioned before, there is this balancing act, where to get these two members, you're giving up 14. But we're doing everything possible to get to that 216. And that -- I don't -- I think when you actually objectively look at the effort that was undertaken, there is no question that every single thing that has been done has been done to maximize the vote count on this.\nQ: And to be very, very clear -- this has been addressed a few times, but I want to get a clearer answer. You talked a lot about how this is the chance, this is an opportunity for Republicans to make good on campaign promises. I asked the President a couple days ago, what happens when you keep pushing if this fails today. And he said, we'll wait and -- we'll have to see what happens. Are you saying right now that there will be no future attempts to comply with that campaign promise if today's attempt fails?\nMR. SPICER: I can't say that there'll never be -- and again, I'm not going to be fatalistic when we've got a vote at 3:30 p.m. I know that the President has made it clear that this is the effort, this was the train that's leaving the station, and that he expects everyone -- you know, this is our opportunity.\nAnd he's got a lot left on the agenda that he wants to get done, whether it's immigration, taxes, the border wall. There's so many other things that he wants to get done that we're not going to sit around and figure out -- this is the opportunity, this is the time, this is the opportunity for every member who has said that they want to repeal and replace Obamacare to put their vote in the \"yes\" column.\nQ: And last one. If it does pass today -- you've talked a lot about this being done in three phases, today being phase one. Phase two and phase three, one of the problems, I think, is that this is not information that is in score-able form -- the steps that Secretary Price might take, and then what may end up in this final bill. Is there any attempt being done --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't know yet. At some point, maybe it can -- I mean --\nQ: Can you put the administrative steps that Secretary Price --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. That's --\nQ: Is that something that's being attempted to be done? Because that's the kind of information I think members want.\nMR. SPICER: I think, right now, we're focused on the vote. But I think that we'll have either OMB or CBO take a look at not just the other elements, but can you look at it in its totality. I don't know that that's -- but that's a good question that I can have the OMB folks address potentially with the CBO folks.\nThank you, guys. I'm sure we'll have some additional updates today. Thank you.\nEND 1:56 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-24", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

Mr. Girling referred to Sean McGarvey, president, North America's Building Trades Unions.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123638", "text": "The President. Thank you very much for being here this morning. Today I'm pleased to announce the official approval of the Presidential permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long-overdue project with efficiency and with speed. We're working out the final details as we speak. It's going to be an incredible pipeline, greatest technology known to man or woman. And frankly, we're very proud of it.\nRuss Girling, President of TransCanada, is right behind me, and I'm going to have him say a few words. I know, Russ, you've been waiting for a long, long time. And I hope you don't pay your consultants anything, because they had nothing to do with the approval. [Laughter] In fact, you should ask for the hundreds of millions of dollars back that you paid them because they didn't do a damned thing except get a no vote, right?\nIt's a great day for American jobs and a historic moment for North American and energy independence. This announcement is part of a new era of American energy policy that will lower costs for American families—and very significantly—reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and create thousands of jobs right here in America. And I also would like to add, I think it's a lot safer to have pipelines than to use other forms of transportation for your product.\nWhen completed, the Keystone XL pipeline will span 900 miles—wow—and have the capacity to deliver more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day to the Gulf Coast refineries. That's some big pipeline.\nThe fact is that this $8 billion investment in American energy was delayed for so long, it demonstrates how our Government has too often failed its citizens and companies over the past long period of time. Today we begin to make things right and to do things right. Today we take one more step in putting the jobs, wages, and economic security of American citizens first. Put America first.\nAs the Keystone XL pipeline now moves forward, this is just the first of many energy and infrastructure projects that my administration will approve—and we've already approved a couple of other big ones, very, very big ones, which we'll be announcing soon—in order to help put Americans back to work, grow our economy, and rebuild our Nation.\nAnd with that, I'd like to invite Russ to say a few words. Russ is a very highly respected man in the energy world. He's president of TransCanada. And I know you'll do a fantastic job, Russ, and get it up and hire plenty of American people.\nThank you. Russ?\nTransCanada President and Chief Executive Officer Russell K. Girling. Thank you, Mr. President. And this is a very, very important day for us, for our company. So on behalf of thousands of people that have worked very hard to get here—as you've pointed out, very long time to get here—but we're very relieved and very much just want to get to work.\nSome of those folks I have with me today: the building trades with Sean McGarvey; some of our—construction contractor, Quanta; our pipe suppliers from Welspun. There's thousands of people that are just ready and itching to get to work. We've got a lot of work to do in the field, but as you pointed out, this is the safest and most reliable way to move our products to market. We're going to use the best technology. It will create thousands of jobs and tax—important tax revenues in local communities.\nThat's something often that's overlooked in new projects like this, is local communities benefit greatly from these projects. It gives them tax revenues in which they can invest in schools, hospitals, roads, teachers, nurses—all of those things—build the fabric of communities and make those places better for those folks to live.\nSo again, thank you very much for this opportunity, and we're not going to let you down, sir.\nThe President. Well, thank you, Russ. And I know the voters appreciate this. Some of them expressed it very, very strongly. The workers definitely appreciated it. The building trades' heads didn't, but now maybe they're going to start to. Where are my building trades guys? I think they're going to start to, because other people were not going to be signing this bill. That I can tell you. And if it ever did get done, it would be years. But I don't think it would have ever gotten done.\nSo we put a lot of people to work, a lot of great workers to work, and they did appreciate it. And they appreciated it, Russ, very much at the polls, as you probably noticed. And so we're very happy about it.\nSo the bottom line: Keystone finished. They're going to start construction when?\nMr. Girling. Well, we've got some work to do in Nebraska to get our permits there——\nThe President. Nebraska.\nMr. Girling. ——so we're looking forward to working through that local——\nThe President. I'll call Nebraska. [Laughter] You know why? Nebraska has a great Governor. They have a great Governor so——\nMr. Girling. Yes. We've been working there for some time, and I do believe that we'll get through that process. But obviously, we have to engage with local landowners, Tribal communities. So we'll be reaching out to those over the coming months to get the other necessary permits that we need, and then we look forward to start construction.\nThe President. Okay. I'm sure Nebraska will be good. Peter is a fantastic Governor who's done a great job, and I'll call him today.\nSo thank you all very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-03-24", "title": "Remarks on the Keystone XL Pipeline Project"}

Thank you very much. We greatly appreciate you being here. I'm delighted to welcome Tom Rutledge, chairman and CEO of Charter Communications—a great company—to the White House. I'm also very honored that my friend, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, my good friend and supporter—we love you—is here with us today. Very appropriate. He's done a fantastic job in Texas, and we have a previous Governor who did a very good job, right?\nGovernor Abbott. Right. [Laughter]\nThe President. Right. He's around here someplace. He's standing right over there.\nI'm very excited about the announcement we are about to make. First, some background. Five years ago Charter Communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy. Today, thanks to hard work and unbelievable leadership—truly great leadership—it's the fastest growing television, Internet, and voice company in the Nation. I would say that's a good job. What do you think?\nGov. Abbott. That's a good job.\nThe President. Not bad. It's very impressive.\nMr. Rutledge. It's a good job, yes. I'd say so myself.\nThe President. We should bring him into government. [Laughter] That would be great.\nTom Rutledge and his team turned the company around, and they did it very quickly. They created a culture of customer service and excellence. And most importantly, they brought back many jobs that had been shipped overseas, something that's happening far too often, but we're changing that. That has been good for certain businesses, but not good for the United States, not good for America, not good for our people.\nWhen American workers win, America as a country wins. We want to have companies that thrive and hire and grow right here in America. And we want them to use American workers and American citizens.\nToday I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has just committed to investing $25 billion—with a \"b,\" $25 billion—you're sure that's right, right? [Laughter] Not with an \"m,\" with a \"b,\" right?\nMr. Rutledge. With a \"b.\"\nThe President. Twenty-five billion dollars here in the United States, and has committed further to hiring 20,000 American workers over the next 4 years.\nCharter has also committed to completely end its offshore call centers—that is such a big deal—and to base 100 percent of its call centers here in the United States, all American jobs. This is great for their workers, it's great for the customers, and it's certainly great for the United States. And you watch, it will be one of your really fantastic decisions. Tom will be opening a brand new, beautiful call center in McAllen, Texas. You know McAllen, right?\nGov. Abbott. I love it. Yes.\nThe President. Very well?\nGov. Abbott. Yes.\nThe President. Good place?\nGov. Abbott. Great place.\nThe President. I knew you were going to say that. [Laughter] Where they will create 600 new American jobs. Charter's announcement follows a number of American businesses—from Exxon to Intel to Lockheed to Boeing to many others—that have recently announced billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory. We are embracing—and by the way, thank you for your support. The Governor was a great supporter, Wilbur and Reed, a great supporter. I want to thank Wilbur and Reed; you've done a fantastic job.\nWe're embracing a new economic model: the American Model. We're going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations—that has started already, big league—reduce Government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers all over this country. And we are really in the process of announcements, and you're going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs and companies and everything coming back into our country. And they're coming in far faster than even I had projected.\nSo we're honored. I'd like to have Tom Rutledge say a few words about what he's doing and about his great company. And after that, you guys can go back to health care. [Laughter]\nTom?\nMr. Rutledge. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, it's a great pleasure to announce these jobs. And Charter has been insourcing jobs for the last 5 years, and as a result of that, our company has performed tremendously. Using high-skilled, high-quality workers actually saves money. And it saves money, as you know as a builder, if you do the job right the first time, it's a lot less expensive than redoing it. And we've found that in the service business, and we've found that we can actually do better with high-quality, high-skilled American workers.\nAnd so we've been doing that, and our company was so successful that we were able to recently do a huge transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks and put together this tremendous company. And as part of that, we're going to insource all the calls that Time Warner Cable outsourced—50 percent of their calls were leaving the country. So we're going to bring all that back and create 20,000 new jobs. And we're very excited about that.\nAnd we're also excited about the opportunity, in the right regulatory climate and the right tax climate, to make major infrastructure investments. And we're going to spend $25 billion. We're committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country. And so we're looking forward to the opportunity to create these jobs and to build this infrastructure.\nAnd Kip Mayo, who manages our call centers, would like to tell you what we're going to do in the McAllen specifically.\nThe President. Go ahead. Charter Communications, Inc., Executive Vice President of Customer Operations Kathleen \"Kip\" Mayo. Okay. So with the opening of the McAllen center, we—it gives us the capacity to be able to create over 600 good-paying jobs. And that allows us to insource work that is currently performed through third parties.\nThe McAllen center will be our first fully bilingual call center. It will allow customers who prefer to communicate with us in Spanish to do so, and we will provide them with service and technical support. We have already hired a general manager, a very qualified woman who is bilingual and is also, coincidentally, a native McAllen. We have—we expect to open the call center next month, and we've hired over a hundred employees already, and they will be trained, and they will be ready to assist our customers in just a few short weeks.\nSo this is a very big step for us in our strategy and our plans over the course of the next few years to create jobs and to bring work in from overseas and back to the United States.\nMr. Rutledge. And they're good jobs too. And they're high-paid jobs. They have pensions. They have health care. They're the kind of jobs people want; they're good, solid middle-class jobs. And we're proud to make them available.\nThe President. That's great. Thank you very much, Tom. Fantastic job with the company. Unbelievable job.\nI'd like to just close it out by asking my friend, Governor Greg Abbott, to say a few words, and he'll talk about the company. But he's very proud of what they've been doing in Texas. So am I.\nSo, Greg.\nGov. Abbott. Sure. Well, first, I'm proud of you. We have a President who's living up to his campaign promise, and that is to create more jobs, but also to create more jobs by returning jobs from overseas back to the United States.\nI want to thank Charter Communications for the great job you're doing, but also for expanding in the great State of Texas. We're happy that this first tranche of your expansion is in the Rio Grande Valley, in McAllen, Texas. You talked about the taxing environment, the regulatory environment. Texas is number one in the Nation for job creation because of the probusiness climate that we have, because we have the right workforce to take care of the needs of companies like Charter Communications.\nSo this is a win-win. It's a win for the President. It's a win for Charter. It's a win for the great State of Texas. The country is better today because of the jobs that will be created tomorrow in McAllen, Texas.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Thank you, Governor. Thanks, Greg.\nGov. Abbott. Thank you, President.\nThe President. Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you.

All right, thank you, everyone, very much. Evcharisto poli. I'm honored to be with you today as we celebrate the 196th anniversary of Greek independence. This day marks the 31st celebration of Greek independence right here at the White House, a tradition started by the great President Ronald Reagan. As a proud Greek American, I've had my eye on this event for weeks, and I'm grateful to welcome his Eminence Archbishop Demetrios, Father Alex, and all of our distinguished guests. I'd also like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and our local parishioners.\n[At this point, Chief of Staff Priebus continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nThe President's commitment to cutting regulations, cutting taxes, investing in priorities like infrastructure and education, and repealing and replacing the failed Obamacare is getting America moving again. As we find new—renewed strength at home, our friends abroad will find us to be even a stronger ally. The President knows just how important our enduring allies are, and Greece is no exception. That is truly why it is such an incredible honor, on this day as a Greek American, to introduce to you, the 45th President of the United States. Ladies and gentleman, President Donald J. Trump.\nThe President. I love the Greeks. Oh, do I love the Greeks. [Laughter] Don't forget, I come from New York. That's all I see is Greeks. They are all over the place. [Laughter]\nThank you very much, Reince. Very much appreciate it. Reince was the most successful leader the RNC—that's called the Republican National Committee—has ever had. And now, as my really terrific and hard-working Chief of Staff, he has really one of the number-one—and I guess you'd have to say, he's one of the top Greeks in the country. And I know a lot of them right in the audience; they're my friends.\nAnd the list also includes, as you know, George Gigicos. [Applause] George. George is great. I said, make sure that microphone is absolutely perfect, George. He never lets me—the Director of White House Advance. And George Sifakis, where's George? And these guys are with me right from the beginning—the Director of the Office of Public Liaison. It's a great team. It's a great, great team. Can't do any better.\nThey helped organize this wonderful event with the Greek Archdiocese of America and so many local parishioners. And I want to thank you all. You're here, you're all over the audience. I want to thank you all.\nYour Eminence and Father Alex, it is a true privilege to host you at the White House. I was deeply honored to have you both at my Inauguration—it was a great day—and I am grateful for your presence here today. I also want to thank you for awarding Reince and George the highest honor of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America: the Medal of Saint Paul.\nTo everyone in your youth choir who just performed, they were beautiful. I heard that music. [Applause] I heard that music. With such elegance and grace, you're amazing—you really are. Beautiful, beautiful sounds. I know you made your parents very proud. And you make all of us proud, right? Today we commemorate an event that we have marked with a national day of celebration for 30 years: Greek Independence Day. Very important. President Ronald Reagan started this wonderful tradition, and we are thrilled to continue it and always will. Greek Independence Day celebrates the rebirth of liberty for the Greek people. It commemorates the fight for the Greek independence that began on March 25, 1821. After nearly 400 years of outside rule, the Greeks longed to regain their sovereignty.\nThis love of freedom and democracy has formed a lasting bond between our two countries. It is a bond that has its origins in Ancient Greece, the birthplace of democracy.\nAmerican President James Monroe and the great American statesman Daniel Webster both supported Greece's struggle for independence. And it was a tough, tough struggle; you know that. Then-Representative Webster honored the role of Greece in forming civilization and said that \"We, like the rest of mankind, are greatly her debtors.\"\nIn years to come, we don't know what will be required to defend our freedom, but we do know that it will demand great, great courage—a courage from all of us—and we will show it, and I have no doubt about that.\nDrawing inspiration from our history and those who come before, we will rise to any occasion.

Just watch.\nI want to thank you all for coming to the White House today. We celebrate Greek history, and we applaud the tremendous contributions of your people to our beloved country.\nMay God bless you all. And with that, I would like to recognize His Eminence.

Greek and American democracy are forever intertwined. American patriots built our Republic on the ancient Greeks' groundbreaking idea that the people should decide their political fates.\nAs a young Nation, only recently free from Great Britain and securing its place on the world stage, America served as a source of inspiration for the revolutionary and freedom-loving Greeks who sought their own independence. Indeed, American citizens stood united with the people of Greece in its \"glorious cause\" of democracy and freedom, as expressed by Philadelphia's Franklin Gazette at the time.\nThe ideas and ideals of the ancient Greeks altered the course of human history, from our own American Republic to the modern Greek state and many other nations. All those who believe in the refrain \"liberty and justice for all,\" and who are devoted to democracy and rule of law, owe a debt of gratitude to Greece and the foundational principles that took root in the ancient city-state of Athens.\nOn this Greek Independence Day, we express our deep gratitude for Greece's enduring friendship in a region that has experienced great uncertainty. Greece is an important partner in our engagements throughout the international sphere. We look forward to strengthening our excellent bilateral defense relationship, and recognize the value and importance Greece's role as a strong ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nThe American people join Greece in celebrating another milestone in its independent history, and we look forward to a future of shared success as partners and allies.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2017, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

These are very, very brave people standing behind me. And we're here today to mark Medal of Honor Day, and it is my great privilege and high honor to welcome 25 Medal of Honor recipients to our White House. Very special honor, thank you all very much. I can say officially they are much braver than I am, okay? [Laughter] Do you agree with that, General?\nSecretary of Defense James N. Mattis. I do, Mr. President. [Laughter]\nMedal of Honor recipient Donald E. Ballard. That's the right answer. [Laughter]\nThe President. That was the right answer.\nOne-third of the Nation's 75 living Medal of Honor recipients are with us. So it's really—that's a great tribute to all of us, a great tribute to our Nation.\nEach of you has risen above and beyond the call of duty in defense of our country, our people, and our flag. You have poured out your hearts, your sweat, and your tears like few others, and your blood—most importantly, your blood—for the United States of America. And we thank you, very much thank you.\nYou are the soul of our Nation, and a grateful republic salutes you. Constantly, we're saluting you. We have great admiration and respect, believe me. I know what you've been through. We write your names and deeds in our national memory, and we will forever remember—forever, forever and ever—those who did not come home, but who died for the cause of freedom.\nI want to thank the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation for preserving the incredible stories of our Medal of Honor heroes for future generations. Done a great job.\nIn this room hangs the portrait of our 26th President, Theodore Roosevelt. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage alongside his band of Rough Riders at the Battle of San Juan Hill. You know about the Rough Riders, right?\nMedal of Honor recipients. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Right? Absolutely. His medal, which is also displayed here, is a reminder of how blessed we truly are to live in the land of heroes. And you are our greatest heroes.\nTo all of those gathered here today, and to all of those warriors who could not be with us, we thank you. Your acts of valor inspire us, and they show us that there is always someone on the night watch to ensure a bright Sun rises on America each and every morning.\nGod bless you, God bless our military, and God bless the United States of America.\nI want to just thank you very much for being here. It's my great honor.\nAnd as you know, we have David who is doing a great job at the VA. Already, tremendous signs are happening, positive signs. And we have General Mattis who is doing a great job out there on the field, and you see a big difference. It's a lot of difference taking place over the last 6 weeks. So I want to thank General Mattis too. And thank you all, and it's great to have met you.\nOh, look at this.\nMedal of Honor Society President Thomas G. Kelly. Mr. President, on behalf of the Medal of Honor Society, I'd like to present a book \"Portraits of Valor,\" which contains all the signatures of the men in the room here, plus about 200 Medal of Honor recipients over the years. Thank you very much.\nThe President. That is very nice. That is really nice.\nSo I know these folks would like to stand behind me when I do this, but I don't want to put them in a political situation—[laughter]—so we're going to talk a little politics. And I think it might be unfair to them, so I'll ask them to—they're going to go over to the Roosevelt Room, and we'll see you a little bit later. We're going to do—unless the press doesn't want to talk politics? Perhaps. [Laughter] No? No? Okay, well, they do.

Price; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123647", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. We were very close, and it was a very, very tight margin. We had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats. They weren't going to give us a single vote, so it's a very difficult thing to do.\nI've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode. It is exploding right now. It's—many States have big problems—almost all States have big problems. I was in Tennessee the other day, and they've lost half of their State in terms of an insurer; they have no insurer. And that's happening to many other places. I was in Kentucky the other day, and similar things are happening.\nSo Obamacare is exploding. With no Democrat support, we couldn't quite get there. We're just a very small number of votes short in terms of getting our bill passed. Lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one. But when you add phase two—which was mostly the signings of Secretary Price, who's behind me—and you add phase three, which I think we would have gotten—it became a great bill. Premiums would have gone down, and it would have been very stable, it would have been very strong. But that's okay.\nBut we were very, very close. And again, I think what will happen is Obamacare, unfortunately, will explode. It's going to have a very bad year. Last year, you had over a hundred-percent increases in various places. In Arizona, I understand it's going up very rapidly again like it did last year; last year it was 116 percent. Many places, 50, 60, 70 percent, I guess it averaged—whatever the average was—very, very high. And this year should be much worse for Obamacare.\nSo what would be really good, with no Democrat support, if the Democrats, when it explodes—which it will soon—if they got together with us and got a real health care bill. I'd be totally open to it. And I think that's going to happen. I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because now they own Obamacare. They own it—hundred percent own it.\nAnd this is not a Republican health care, this is not anything but a Democrat health care. And they have Obamacare for a little while longer, until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. And just remember: This is not our bill, this is their bill.\nNow, when they all become civilized and get together and try and work out a great health care bill for the people of this country, we're open to it. We're totally open to it.\nI want to thank the Republican Party. I want to thank Paul Ryan; he worked very, very hard, I will tell you that. He worked very, very hard. Tom Price and Mike Pence—who's right here—our Vice President, our great Vice President. Everybody worked hard. I worked as a team player and would have loved to have seen it passed. But again, I think you know I was very clear, because I think there wasn't a speech I made, or very few, where I didn't mention that perhaps the best thing that can happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great health care bill in the future, after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. It will go very smoothly, I really believe. I think this is something—it certainly was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process. We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in, obviously, both the Senate and in the House. So it's been—certainly for me, it's been a very interesting experience. But in the end, I think it's going to be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan.\nSo thank you all very much. And I'll see you soon.\nTax Reform\nQ. Mr. President, is it now your intention to go for tax reform? Or what's next on your agenda?\nThe President. We'll probably be going right now for tax reform, which we could have done earlier, but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some Democrat support. Remember this: We had no Democrat support. So now we're going to go for tax reform, which I've always liked.\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Paul D. Ryan/Republican Party\nQ. And you're confident in Speaker Ryan's leadership and his ability to get things done?\nThe President. Yes, I am. I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very, very hard. A lot of different groups, he's got a lot of factions. And there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here. But I've had a great relationship with the Republican Party. It seems that both sides like Trump, and that's good. And you see that, I guess, more clearly than anybody.\nBut we've had a—I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party. But certainly, there's a big history. I think Paul really worked hard. And I would say that we will probably start going very, very strongly for the big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next.\nHealth Care Reform/Former President Barack Obama\nQ. Sir, is it fair to Americans to let Obamacare explode?\nThe President. Well, it's going to happen. There's not much you can do about it—it's going to. Bad things are going to happen to Obamacare. There's not much you can do to help it. I've been saying that for a year and a half. I said, look, eventually it's not sustainable. The insurance companies are leaving—you know that. They're leaving one by one, as quick as you can leave. And you have States, in some cases, soon will not be covered. So there's no way out of that.\nBut the one thing that was happening, as we got closer and closer, everybody was talking about how wonderful it was, and now it will go back to real life, people will see how bad it is. And it's getting much worse.\nYou know, I said the other day, when President Obama left—'17, he knew he wasn't going to be here; '17 is going to be a very, very bad year for Obamacare. Very, very bad. You're going to have explosive premium increases. And your deductibles are so high, people don't even get to use it.\nSo they'll go with that for a little while. And I honestly believe—I know some of the Democrats, and they're good people—I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great health care bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country. And I think that's going to happen.\nHealth Care Reform\nQ. You could have passed a bill in the House without any Democratic support, why do you think you weren't able to craft a deal among the Republican Party? The President. Well, we were very close. We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short. Could have even been closer than that. You'll never know because you'll never know how they vote. But in the end, I think we would have been 10 votes, maybe closer. And—but it was very hard to get almost a hundred percent. You're talking about a very, very large number of votes—among any group. And we were very close to doing it. But when you get no votes from the other side, meaning the Democrats, it's really a difficult situation.\nHealth Care Reform\nQ. Will you reach out to Democrats now?\nThe President. No, I think we have to let Obamacare go its way for a little while, and we'll see how things go. I'd love to see it do well, but it can't. I mean, it can't. It's not a question of, gee, I hope it does well. I would love it to do well. I want great health care for the people of this Nation. But it can't do well. It's imploding, and soon will explode, and it's not going to be pretty.\nSo the Democrats don't want to see that, so they're going to reach out when they're ready. And whenever they're ready, we're ready.\nRepublican Party/Health Care Reform\nQ. Do you feel betrayed by the House Freedom Caucus at all? They seemed to be the most difficult to get.\nThe President. No, I'm not betrayed. They're friends of mine. I'm disappointed because we could have had it. So I'm disappointed. I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you. We really had it. It was pretty much there within grasp. But I'll tell you what's going to come out of it is a better bill—I really believe a better bill. Because there were things in this bill I didn't particularly love. And I think it's a better bill.\nYou know, both parties can get together and do real health care. That's the best thing. Obamacare was rammed down everyone's throat.\nVice President Michael R. Pence. That's right.\nThe President. 100 percent Democrat. And I think having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement.\nSo, no, I think that this is going to end up being a very good thing. I'm disappointed, but they're friends of mine, and they got—this is a very hard time for them and a very hard vote. But they're very good people.\nHealth Care Reform\nQ. You mentioned that there were things in this bill that you didn't necessarily love. What specifically are those?\nThe President. Well, I think we could have things that I would have liked more. And if we had bipartisan, I really think we could have a health care bill that would be the ultimate. And I think the Democrats know that also. And some day, in the not-too-distant future, that will happen.\nAnd I never said—I guess I'm here, what, 64 days? I never said repeal and replace Obamacare—you've all heard my speeches—I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days. I have a long time. But I want to have a great health care bill and plan, and we will. It will happen. And it won't be in the very distant future. I really believe there will be some Democrat support, and that will happen, and it will be an even better bill. I think this was a very good bill. I think it will be even better the next time around. I don't think that's going to be in too long a period of time. Health Care Reform\nQ. Anything specifically you want to see changed going from this bill to the next bill?\nThe President. No, I mean, I don't want to speak about specifics, but there are things I could have—I would have liked even more. But I thought overall this was a very, very good bill. And I thought Tom Price—Dr. Tom Price—who really is amazing on health care and his knowledge—I thought he did a fantastic job. Same with Mike Pence. I think these two guys, they worked so hard and really did a fantastic job.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "timestamp": "2017-03-24", "title": "Remarks on Health Care Reform Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters"}

Thanks to your hard work, your support, and your prayers -- West Virginia voted overwhelmingly to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States -- and we will never forget it. (Applause.)\nLet me thank our host today -- Ronald Reagan Foster and Nancy Reagan Foster. I just said a little bit ago they're my second favorite Ron and Nancys I've ever met. (Applause.) I want to thank them. I want to thank the whole Foster's Supply team and all the great employees who came out today. You've been building this state and building the American Dream since 1981.\nIn fact, Ron, I just heard that you have a wall division here at Foster's. Maybe we need to talk. (Applause.)\nWhat you do and what you've done here since 1981 is what makes this country great. And the President and I are truly grateful for you and for all the good people who are part of the Foster Supply team and all the neighbors and friends who've gathered here today to stand with us. Give yourselves a round of applause for coming out on a Saturday afternoon. (Applause.) We couldn't be more grateful\nAnd Congressman Evan Jenkins, thank you for being with us. We're so grateful for your support. And to Congressman Alex Mooney, thank you for your service to this country. It is great to be in your district. (Applause.) It truly is.\nYou know, it is so humbling for me to stand before you today in this role. I'm just a small-town guy from southern Indiana. My grandfather immigrated to this country, and to think that I had the privilege to raise my right hand on January 20th and accept the oath of office to serve as the 48th Vice President of the United States is the greatest privilege of my life. And let me just say, on behalf of my whole family, thank you, West Virginia, for giving us the opportunity to serve. (Applause.)\nI'll tell you, it is the greatest privilege of my life to be Vice President to President Donald Trump. President Trump is my friend. He loves his family and he loves this country, with boundless energy, optimism, courage and determination. And let me be clear on one thing -- President Donald Trump is going to be the best friend American small business will ever have. (Applause.)\nThat's why he picked Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. Isn't she amazing? (Applause.) Linda McMahon knows an awful lot about small business. Linda and her husband started their company as a small business back in the 1970s, as Titan Sports, and they built it into an international entertainment enterprise -- the WWE. Any fans in the house? (Applause.) I'm one. Now she's bringing that great business experience to building a business to help small businesses across America grow and thrive.\nYou know, Linda, we're grateful for your leadership. But maybe we could have used a few of your WWE superstars on Capitol Hill yesterday. (Applause.) Give her another round of applause for leading the Small Business Administration with such great qualities. (Applause.) With Linda McMahon at the SBA, we're listening to small business owners -- and that hadn't been happening for a while in Washington, D.C. -- been listening to people just like many who are with us today. Would you join me in thanking all the great small business owners who are gathered here today -- people that make West Virginia such a great place to live, to work and to raise their family. (Applause.) Thank you all.\nWe just had a great conversation. We talked with these job-creators here in West Virginia about the President's pro-business agenda of less regulations, lower taxes, fair trade, better infrastructure, and a renewed focus on American energy. And I heard again from these West Virginia small business owners about the need to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.) They told me how Obamacare stands in the way and stifles growth. It's a burden not just to job creators, it's also a burden to the American people.\nFolks, I wasn't surprised to hear it because every promise of Obamacare has been broken. You all remember what they were. Seven years ago, after Obamacare was signed into law, they told us if you like your doctor, you can keep them -- not true. They said if you like your health plan, you can keep it -- not true. We were all told that the cost of health insurance would go down. Well, that one wasn't true either. And West Virginia knows this better than most. It's heartbreaking to say that last year alone, Obamacare premiums here in West Virginia spiked by a stunning 32 percent. Over 40 percent of the state doesn't have any choice of an insurance provider on the Obamacare exchange.\nWest Virginians, and President Trump, we all know the truth about this failed law – that every day Obamacare survives is another day that America suffers. That's why the President worked tirelessly over the last several weeks to get Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. You saw his resolve to work with whoever he needed to work with, to call whoever he needed to call to get our plan across the finish line this week on Capitol Hill.\nI got to tell you, I was inspired by President Trump's determination and commitment to keep his promise to the American people. (Applause.) And the President and I are grateful for Speaker Paul Ryan and all the House Republicans who stood with us in this effort to begin the end of Obamacare. But as we all learned yesterday, Congress just wasn't ready. You saw it -- with 100 percent of House Democrats -- every single one -- and a handful of Republicans actually standing in the way of President Trump's plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. We're back to the drawing board.\nYou know, Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats in Congress, actually said yesterday was a victory for the American people. But West Virginia knows better. Yesterday wasn't a victory for the American people. It was a victory for the status quo in Washington, D.C. And it was a victory for the disaster of Obamacare.\nBut I promise you that victory won't last very long. (Applause.) The American people want Obamacare gone. And as the President said today, don't worry, America. He just tweeted this morning. Obamacare is going to continue to explode. And when Republicans and Democrats finally decide to come together and to repeal and replace Obamacare, we'll be ready to get the job done. (Applause.)\nAnd as the President promised just this morning, \"we'll all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people.\" We will end the Obamacare nightmare and give the American people the world-class healthcare that they deserve. (Applause.) Until then, I can promise you, President Trump is never going to stop fighting to keep his promises to the American people -- and we will Make America Great Again. (Applause.)\nAnd we're moving forward. Next up, we're going to get back to the President's three-part agenda -- jobs, jobs, and jobs -- for every American, in West Virginia and across this country. (Applause.)\nAnd the great news is we've actually been on that agenda from the very day President Trump was elected. It's been amazing to see jobs coming back to this country -- even since the day after the election. Last month the economy added 235,000 jobs. Construction and manufacturing are booming again. Companies are canceling plans to move jobs and factories overseas -- and they're building them right here in America once again. (Applause.) It's true. Businesses and consumers haven't been this confident in years -- and by some measures, for more than a decade.\nFolks, the era of slow growth is over -- and a new era of American growth and jobs has already begun. (Applause.) And it's all because the American people know President Donald Trump is a man of his word and he's a man of action. In fact, on day one, President Trump went straight to work rolling back reams of red tape that have been killing jobs and small business America across this country. He instructed every bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new regulations out of our nation's capital. (Applause.) He's already taken decisive action to protect American jobs and American workers -- and we will not stop until we end illegal immigration once and for all. (Applause.)\nJust this week, the President authorized the Keystone pipeline, creating tens of thousands of jobs and protecting our energy future. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, we're just getting started. Next up, as the President said yesterday, we're going to roll our sleeves up and we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. (Applause.) Working with this Congress, President Trump is going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan. And we're going to get this American economy moving again. (Applause.) We're going to reform the tax code and make it flatter and simpler and fairer.\nI guarantee you there isn't anyone here, including the Fosters, who can make sense of the tax code. You know, there's an old joke -- there's an old joke about how the tax code in this country is 10 times the size of the Bible with none of the good news. (Applause.) Right? The truth is our taxes makes it far too difficult for job-creators and hardworking people all across this country get ahead and to achieve the American Dream.\nThat's why our tax plan will make American businesses and American opportunities more competitive all over this country. We're going to also cut the corporate tax rate in America. We have one of the highest business taxes in America -- we're going to cut it to 15 percent so American companies will invest in American operations to create American jobs. (Applause.)\nSo we're going to cut taxes for every American, and we're going to cut taxes for free enterprise. But we're going to get this economy moving with less regulation, and more American energy. Let me make you a promise -- right after we dropped our right hands on January 20th, it was official: The war on coal is over. (Applause.) And a new era of American energy has begun. (Applause.)\nFor far too long, politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. have crippled our nation's economy and crippled West Virginia's economy, without regard to the impact that it has on people's utility bills, and the impact it has on jobs of hardworking Americans. Right here in West Virginia, they've pushed mining companies to the breaking point. They jeopardized thousands of good-paying jobs, and cut off a brighter future for countless West Virginia families. It's heartbreaking to think that West Virginia has lost more than a third of its mining jobs over the last few years alone , and that over 130 mines have been shut down since 2009.\nFolks, that's not right. The hardworking men and women of this state have been forgotten for too long -- and they will be forgotten no more under President Donald Trump. (Applause.) From the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has been fighting for West Virginia and fighting for American energy. We're working with leaders in Congress and we're working with the new director over at the EPA Scott Pruitt, to slash through red tape to make sure that unelected bureaucrats can't kill your jobs and cripple your economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nWe're going to bring back jobs. We're going to get Washington out of the way of energy producers and coal miners -- because energy means growth for America, and President Trump digs coal. (Applause.) Our country is going to be stronger, and West Virginia will be stronger and more prosperous because of the President's leadership.\nWhen you get right down to it, President Trump is going to create jobs and opportunity and prosperity in this country like never before. But Making America Great Again isn't just about our economy. It also means protecting our nation and defending our way of life.\nAnd let me tell you, I'm with him every day -- President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. And that will always be true. (Applause.) That's why, from the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has been standing with the men and women in law enforcement all across America. And we always will. (Applause.) We'll work with the Congress to make sure those who protect our families and our communities have the resources and training they need to do their jobs and to come home safe to their families.\nYou know, there's a fair number of law enforcement personnel that are with us today. I know most of you are standing, but would all of you just take a minute to show the men and women in law enforcement here in West Virginia just how much we all truly appreciate the job that they do protecting our families. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump is putting our security first and our safety first. That's why he's strengthening our borders. This President is going to build a wall, enforce our laws, and as he told the Congress, we're acting right now to take \"gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens\" off the streets of West Virginia and off the streets of America. (Applause.)\nAnd as the father of a United States Marine, let me say this, from my heart -- (applause) -- I couldn't be more proud and grateful to say that we have a President who will rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe at last. (Applause.) He's going to do it.\nSo it's about jobs; it's about energy; it's about our national defense. And President Trump is also keeping one more promise I want to mention, and that's the promise that he made to nominate to the Supreme Court someone who will be faithful to our Constitution. By nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump has kept his word to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court who will keep faith with the Constitution and who will uphold the God-given liberties that are enshrined there. (Applause.)\nYou saw it this week. My daughter was off work -- she got to watch CSPAN. She told me she watched a lot of Judge Gorsuch's testimony before the Senate. Three days of powerful testimony before the Senate, Judge Neil Gorsuch made it clear why President Trump nominated him to the highest court in the land, didn't he? He demonstrated temperament and intellect -- explains why the bipartisan praise is rolling in. The truth is America saw this week what President Trump saw when he made that decision. Judge Neil Gorsuch is one of the most respected, qualified, and mainstream nominees to the Supreme Court in American history. (Applause.)\nBut, remarkably, this week Senator Chuck Schumer and the obstructionists in his party in the Senate actually announced that the Democrats plan to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination to be an associate justice. That's something that's never been done successfully in American history.\nSo let me say this to you, West Virginia. If we can get the help of Senator Joe Manchin, and with the help of Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Judge Neil Gorsuch will soon become Justice Neil Gorsuch -- and America and the rule of law will be better for it. (Applause.)\nSo let me be clear. President Trump and I are confident, the United States Senate will confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch, one way or the other. (Applause.)\nIt is great to be in West Virginia. (Applause.)\nMy friends, we've come to a pivotal moment in our nation's history. In this moment, I think we need every freedom-loving American -- we need all of you -- to stand up, speak out, and take time, as you've done today to come and be engaged and be involved. We need you to keep telling your neighbors here in West Virginia we can do better, that we're renewing and restoring this country, that we can put America back on a path to a brighter future. And this I know we will do because I have faith.\nYou know, over the mantel of our home since my first run for office back in the year 2000 there's been a framed copy of a verse from the Good Book. It was in our home in Indiana and it was in the Governor's Residence in Indiana when I served there. And now it hangs above the mantel in the home of the Vice President of the United States. And it simply reads these words: \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.\"\nIn November, the people of West Virginia voted to give America a President -- a President with the strength and the courage and the vision to make America great again. You voted to give us a new leader who would make America prosperous again. And I believe with all my heart, that with your continued support and faith, and with God's help, together we will restore this country, that our best days are ahead, and that, together, we will Make America Great Again. (Applause.)\nThank you, West Virginia. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

In the address, the President referred to NASA astronauts Christopher J. Cassidy and Tracy Caldwell Dyson. He also referred to S. 442, which was approved March 21 and assigned Public Law No. 115-10.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123609", "text": "My fellow Americans, this week, in the company of astronauts, I was honored to sign the NASA Transition Authorization Act right into law. With this legislation, we renew our national commitment to NASA's mission of exploration and discovery. And we continue a tradition that is as old as mankind. We look to the heavens with wonder and curiosity.\nMore than two decades ago, one scientist followed this curiosity and dramatically changed our understanding of the universe. The year was 1995. Taxpayers were spending billions and billions of dollars on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The astronomer in charge had a novel idea. He wanted to use the expensive telescope in a totally unconventional way.\nInstead of pointing Hubble's eye at nearby stars or distant formations, Robert Williams wanted to peer into the void. He aimed the massive telescope at one of the emptiest regions of the night sky. For 10 days, during Christmas of 1995, Hubble stared into the abyss, seeking whatever light it could glean from the darkness. And it was total darkness.\nFellow astronomers didn't know if he'd see much of anything. But Williams was rewarded, and the entire world was struck by the awesome images of our satellite returned. In that tiny patch of sky, the Hubble Deep Field showed thousands of lights. Each brilliant spot represented not a single star, but an entire galaxy.\nThe discovery was absolutely incredible. But the unforgettable image did not satisfy our deep hunger for knowledge. It increased evermore and even more and reminded us how much we do not know about space, frankly, how much we do not know about life.\nWith this week's NASA reauthorization, we continue progress on Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope. It is amazing. The Webb Telescope is set to launch next year. It will gaze back through time and space to the very first stars and the earliest galaxies in the universe. We can only imagine what incredible visions it will bring.\nAt a time when Washington is consumed with the daily debates of our Nation, I was proud that Congress came together overwhelmingly to reaffirm our Nation's commitment to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.\nNASA's greatest discoveries teach us many, many things. One lesson is the need to view old questions with fresh eyes; to have the courage to look for answers in places we have never looked before; to think in new ways because we have new information. Most of all, new discoveries remind us that, in America, anything is possible if we have the courage and wisdom to learn.\nIn the span of one lifetime, our Nation went from black and white pictures of the first airplanes, to beautiful images of the oldest galaxies, captured by a camera in outer space.\nI am confident that if Americans can achieve these things, there is no problem we cannot solve. There is no challenge we cannot meet. There is no aim that is too high. Whatever it takes and however long it will be, we are a nation of problem solvers, and the future belongs to us. We are truly a great place to be. I love America.", "timestamp": "2017-03-25", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123698", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n6:00 P.M. EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good evening to everyone who is here. Just briefly, I just want to remind everyone that this is on background. It's attributable to a senior White House official and is embargoed until 11:00 p.m. this evening.\nWith that, I'm going to hand it over to [senior administration official], who many of you have seen up here before, to talk about energy and environmental policy. So I will turn it over. Those in the room will be able to ask questions. The phone line does not take questions, so following the opening remarks, we will take questions at the end.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. So, as was mentioned, I guess we've been waiting for this for a while. We're going to get the executive order on energy independence out tomorrow. The President will sign it. This policy is in keeping with President Trump's desire to make the United States energy independent. He believes that we can serve the twin goals of protecting the environment and providing clean air and clean water, getting the EPA back to its core mission, while at the same time, again, moving forward on energy production in the United States. The United States is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. We have plenty deposits of coal. We want to look at nuclear, renewables, all of it. And again, we can do both to serve the environment and increase energy at the same time.\nThe policy tomorrow will look back and it will look forward. It will look back in the sense that there are a number of policies from the Obama administration that the President believes should be reviewed. Some of them should be taken off the books immediately, to the extent we can. And it will also look forward to the extent that we will provide the framework, or the beginning framework for a strategy on energy, such that each executive department and agency in the United States government will be responsible for identifying all regulations, all rules, all policies, guidance documents that serve as obstacles or impediments to domestic energy production.\nAnd over the course of about 170 days, there will enter a process with the agencies and various offices within the White House to review the plans that they come up with. And then, after that period, those will serve -- those plans will serve as the blueprint for the administration going forward on energy policy.\nNow, kind of going through the order, there will be a number of, as I said, policies that we think should be taken off the books. There will be a number of executive orders related to climate change that the previous President issued. We believe a number of those orders have already kind of run their course. We also believe that those orders simply don't reflect the President's priorities. And when it comes to dealing with climate change, we want to take our own course and do it in our own form and fashion.\nThere are also policies related to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Council of Environmental Quality, as some of you may know, published guidance last August dealing with climate change. That guidance was widely opposed by a number of different industries. We believe that that guidance goes way beyond what NEPA requires. We will rescind that guidance.\nThere's also language in there on the social cost of greenhouse gasses, social cost of carbon methane and nitrous oxide. The previous administration put out its own estimates, not in a very transparent fashion, and in a fashion that we believe violates longstanding OMB policy. So, as a matter of federal policy, those estimates will no longer stand. We will also take a look at a number of very major regulations announced by the previous administration or promulgated by the previous administration. Probably the biggest one that I think you all care about the most is the Clean Power Plan, and we will initiate a review of that rule. The new plant rule, as well, under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act will also be reviewed.\nThe coal moratorium that the Interior Department imposed, that will also be rescinded. We don't have to go through an EPA process on that. And then the regulations affecting methane on oil and gas production both at EPA and the BLM, and then the BLM's hydraulic fracturing all will be reviewed over the course of time to determine whether those actually reflect the policy priority that's outlined at the beginning of the order, as you will read it tomorrow.\nSo with that, I'm happy to take any questions.\nQ: Can you either maybe list, or if you can confirm that the executive orders that you're going to pull back from Obama are in sync with preparing the U.S. for the effects of climate change and the memo on climate and national security?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's correct.\nQ: Okay, great. And then on the social cost of carbon, you said that the Obama -- that won't stand, are you planning to recalculate your own? And if so --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The language says that to the extent that agencies have to monetize the cost of greenhouse gas regulations that they have to follow OMB Circular A-4, which was the longstanding practice of the federal government, prior to the administration -- the previous administration putting out its own estimates.\nQ: Will the U.S. still meet its commitments to some of the Paris deal?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In terms of the Paris agreement, whether we stay in or not is still under discussion.\nQ: How can you meet your U.S. commitments under the Paris deal if you get rid of the Clean Power Plan?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, the Paris agreement is still under discussion, so you can't really address Paris at this point in time.\nQ: But just following on that, is there a way to abide by the Paris agreement without that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, certainly if you look at the previous administration's INDC that they submitted to the U.N., I mean, we have a different view about how you should address climate policies in the United States. So we're going to go in a different direction. I can't get into what ultimately that means from an emissions standpoint. I have no idea.\nQ: And just to be clear, he's just signing one single executive order tomorrow?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Correct. That's right.\nQ: Do you define \"impediment\"? So if you're having agencies go in and look for rules and regulations that --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Yeah, burden -- it's actually burdens that will be defined in the executive order. You'll see how it's defined.\nQ: And you're looking (inaudible) with an eye towards getting rid of them or revising them?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Could be both. Yeah, it could be revising, improving, updating, or if things are illegal or, again, if they don't conform to the President's priorities. It depends -- it runs the gambit. That's what review is for.\nQ: Have you set up a time frame for the review of the Clean Power Plan?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: No. There's no time frame in the executive order, but I think Administrator Pruitt is ready to hit the ground running on that one.\nQ: -- it took about two years to put in place because they had the whole process with consultation, comments -- responding to comments. Is that true in terms of undoing it as well, that it could take a couple years?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: We will absolutely have to go through the Administrator Procedure Act on that one. There will be notice and comment. I suspect -- I would bet a good deal, I'm sure there will be litigation once the final review is undertaken. So whether that's two years, three years, or one year, I don't know. It's going to take some time.\nQ: For those of us who don't have a factsheet, would you mind going through the list? You said a number of executive orders. Justin just asked a question about how many will he sign. Can you just walk through the number of executive orders, and then number of guidance -- whatever it will indicate are under review?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: So he mentioned two of them. There was a climate change executive order, I think, on adaptation. There was a climate change executive order on national security. And then I think the other documents that we're going to rescind are the presidential memorandums on the Climate Action Plan, for example, which laid out, kind of, the -- this was 2013, where President Obama laid out a whole series of actions. So that, obviously, will be going away.\nThere's also a presidential memorandum on mitigation that came out in 2015 that affects a number of different departments, which we think is sort of additive to what is required under law, so that would be rescinded. I think there's also a document on reducing methane emissions. I believe there's something EPA put out, or maybe it was President Obama put that out as well. That's another document that we will rescind as well. So probably in total, about six of those in the order.\nSo it's both executive orders and presidential memorandum. And then there's also -- you mentioned guidance. So the CEQ: climate change guidance, that will be rescinded as well. That was finalized in August of last year.\nQ: Can I ask you what's the status of (inaudible.)\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: All in process. We're definitely interviewing candidates as we speak.\nQ: Do you have any --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: No.\nQ: What about the report that if repeals in Obama-era guidance on how federal agencies should take global warming into account when doing any EPA permitting? Can you confirm that that's being --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Yeah, that's what I just said. That's -- yes, it will.\nQ: Does it cover the Obama-era flood hazard standard that he implemented in 2015?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Don't believe so.\nQ: And are you -- there's been some arguments around electricity prices and how rescinding the Clean Power Plan could reduce electricity prices. Are you looking specifically at studies or research that shows that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Well, certainly -- our economic consulting (inaudible) Clean Power Plan, the final Clean Power Plan, in their view, was, if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect, I believe that you would see, on average, electricity price increases of 10 percent or more in 41 states.\nQ: Any available finding is not --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Not in the order. Correct.\nQ: Just a question -- (inaudible) -- able to achieve?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Energy independence. That's the goal.\nQ: What would be your policy on carbon taxation?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: We don't have a policy on carbon taxation.\nQ: So do you plan to apply it in the future?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: No.\nQ: No carbon taxation?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: No.\nQ: During the campaign, President Trump -- then candidate Trump promised coal workers their coal jobs would come back. Is it the White House's view that this executive order plans to make good on that promise, or attempt to make good on that promise?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you look at what the previous administration did -- some called it the \"war on coal\" -- we're going to -- I think the President believes that a lot of those regulations were not helpful to the coal industry. And so I think he's going to do his part to try to take a review, and if we need to rescind them, we will. But, yeah, absolutely, I think he made a pledge to the coal industry, and he's going to do whatever he can to help those workers.\nQ: And a number of coal executives came to the White House and afterwards they told reporters that they don't think he can make good on that promise. What's the White House --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL: Yeah, a lot of different -- I mean, it's certainly true that there a lot of different forces that conspire to affect the coal industry, the gas industry, a lot of industries. Certainly, government policy has a role. So to the extent the President can have a beneficial effect on that policy, he's going to take it.\nQ: What about -- keeping on coal -- about the Interior Department's moratorium on the new coal mining leases on federal land?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes.\nQ: Will that be rescinded too?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Absolutely, yes.\nQ: Can you just talk us through a little bit of the timing? Was there any component of this that was just a little bit tricky or took a little bit more time to finalize?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we just -- we wanted to get it right. As I had laid out, there's a lot of pieces to this and it is legally complex, and there is litigation going on with some of these rules. So you just got to be very careful on how you do it. And so we were careful, and I think maybe that's why it took a little bit longer than maybe you all wanted to see it.\nQ: Regarding the legal challenges, does it still require DOJ to ask the D.C. Circuit --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The CPP case?\nQ: Yes.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes.\nQ: -- in the past the President called climate change being a hoax and questioned whether carbon is the main cause. What is the White House position? Does the scientific view of what was climate change -- is that something (inaudible)?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. Yes, I think the President understands the disagreement over the policy response, and that's clear. You'll see that in the order tomorrow. We're taking a different path.\nQ: But he said manmade climate change?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure.\nQ: So this is a different policy response, but do you still feel like you're protecting the environment? And if so, how do you feel you're doing it better -- if you think that you are?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, because the Clean Power Plan is designed to address climate change -- you look at EPA's own numbers, they even admitted that in terms of how it's going to impact global temperatures, it's not. So I think there are plenty of rules on the books already we will continue to enforce that provide for clean air and clean water. And that's what we're going to do. I think the President has been very clear that he wants the EPA to stick to that basic core mission that Congress set out for it.\nQ: So if it doesn't include -- if it includes a potential repeal of the Clean Power Plan, for example, which, as you know is, the answer to the Supreme Court in 2007 and the (inaudible) in 2009, does the administration feel that it's legally obligated to regulate greenhouse gases?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, certainly, there is an endangerment fine -- that endangerment fine was made for -- under Section 202 for vehicles. But I don't believe that there is an obligation under Section 111-B or 111-D to regulate to a different section of the Clean Air Act. I'm sure there plenty who disagree with that, but that's not something we're thinking about right now. We have a massive rule in front of us that was stayed by the Supreme Court, and we need to act on it.\nQ: But so the Supreme Court -- the endangerment finding then was upheld --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, there's a separate endangerment finding under 111-D, as you know, correct? And I don't think the previous administration made one, if memory serves. So, again, we're talking about different sections of the Clean Air Act, and the Supreme Court actually spoke to that in the UARG Case. Go back and read the UARG Case in terms of PSD and what the Court thought of that. So different sections of the Clean Air Act require different sets of actions. And I think the previous administration had a view about their 202-A finding. I think our view may be different on that.\nQ: And just one more. So what is -- you mentioned clean air, clean water, and you mentioned that President Trump agrees that climate change is manmade. So what is the administration's answer to climate change?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think there are a number of different answers. I think, one, you got to make sure you have a strong economy. You got to make sure you got people who are actually working. To the extent that the economy is strong and growing and you have prosperity -- that's the best way to protect the environment.\nCertainly, natural gas is important. Clean coal is important. Nuclear is important; renewables are important. There are a number of different ways that you can address this issue. You can address environmental protection, and that's what we're going to do. I think he's laid that out very clearly. Tomorrow in the order, you'll see that, as well.\nQ: What do you mean if there's a strong economy and people are working, that that's the best way to protect the --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Because -- well, look, globally, I think the more prosperous the economies -- compare the United States to other economies, we have a cleaner, healthier environment than other countries that don't. Look at China.\nQ: Is it fair to say that economic reasons are the main guiding factor in shaping your energy policies? Is that the main consideration, helping American workers?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, right.\nQ: Okay, so is it fair to say that the American workers are more important in your mind than the environment?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I think what we're saying is that the previous administration devalued workers by the policies. We're saying we can do both. We can protect the environment and provide people with work and keep the economy growing. And that's the policy agenda we're going to try to focus on.\nQ: You mentioned clean air and clean water. Will the executive order mention climate change at the --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, climate change will be mentioned because there will be orders that we'll have to address from the previous administration.\nQ: So how would you describe the fight against climate change then for you? Is it a priority? Is it irrelevant? Is it somewhere in the picture?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think it's an issue that deserves attention, but, again, I think the President has been very clear that he's not going to pursue climate or environmental policies that put the U.S. economy at risk. It's very simple.\nQ: What about all the scientists who are saying climate change is going to have adverse economic consequences -- things like rising sea levels, more hazardous hurricanes -- how do you address those economic arguments?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, you'll have to talk to those scientists. Maybe I can talk to you afterward. I'm not familiar with what you're talking about. But again, the President's policy is very clear about addressing -- making sure we're addressing the economy, providing people with jobs, and we're making sure that EPA is sticking to its core mission.\nQ: Are you saying you're not aware that scientists are concerned about rising sea levels or more violent storms might impact the economy --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would want to see the research. Sure, that would be good. Show it to me.\nQ: What about environmentalists threatening to sue the Trump administration to defend the CPP? Does the White House have a --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Say again? I'm sorry.\nQ: Environmentalists threatening to sue the Trump administration to defend the CPP.\nQ: I mean, if we review the CPP I'm sure they will disagree with that. But what's your point?\nQ: What is the White House response if they threaten --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We disagree.\nQ: So are you saying -- back to the previous line of questioning -- are you saying that you don't believe that there are rising sea levels --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I didn't say that at all. I'm just -- I want to see --\nQ: You said you want to see --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I want to see the studies.\nQ: So is there a question?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, it's not a question. I'd like to see it. Send it to me.\nQ: -- sea levels rise, there are a lot of major coastal cities, like New York and Miami -- decrease our GDP --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It certainly could. It certainly could. Absolutely.\nQ: But you said the White House is interested in ways it could protect the environment without harming the American worker. And I realize that's still under progress. (Inaudible) is the type of thing that you're thinking of or interested in pursuing?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sorry, say it again.\nQ: -- the type of ways in which the administration thinks that it could both address environmental concerns and protect the American worker.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, there are -- you know, there are clean air laws on the books that we will enforce, and we will do that. And when it comes to the policies like the Clean Power Plan, which we don't believe provide environmental protections, we'll make sure we review those to protect the jobs that all the analysis shows it will definitely destroy jobs over the long term. So, again, there are laws on the books. We're going to enforce those laws. But when it comes to laws or regulation like the Clean Power Plan, we're going to go in a different direction.\nQ: Is there anything the administration could do to address climate change that doesn't harm American workers?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I mean, I was just talking about it -- whether it's clean coal, whether it's nuclear power, or whether it's renewables, allowing all those to flourish, that's a good way to address the issue.\nQ: What is the messages you want to send to countries like India and China on clean energy and climate change? Those are two major --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I mean, I think the United States is going to continue to pursue its interests as it sees fit. I mean, I think the President has been very clear about having an America First energy policy. We have a lot of energy in this country and the President wants to continue to remove any obstacles so we can produce it. I mean, that's --\nQ: That's fine, but something is happening climate-wise in China also has an impact on the United States, too, right?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I suppose. Yes.\nQ: Are you saying that all the countries should pursue this as they see fit and --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think they do. I mean, I think they already do.\nQ: -- the Paris deal --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not getting into good or bad on Paris because that's still under discussion.\nQ: But do you think that they should be coordination because these countries on climate change --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That is true. But again, I think -- again, I'd just go back to where we stand on these critical questions about energy production, about jobs and keeping EPA to its core mission. And that's what's in this order. That's what I'm focused on right now. You're talking about a much bigger issue than --\nQ: And finally, President Trump has spoken with a lot of\n-- met a lot of foreign leaders in his two month period. Has climate change been a part of that discussion with them?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know. I could follow up with you on that, but I'm not in those discussions.\nQ: So you said the President believes in manmade climate change. Is he making sure that everybody in the White House working on this also believes in manmade climate change?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I think that it's not a controversial statement. I guess the key question is to what extent, over what period of time. Those are the big questions that I think still we need to answer. Again, we're focused on this order for tomorrow. We believe that this order, again, is going to do what the President set out to do in terms of his priorities, whether on energy production, protecting jobs, and making sure that we're getting EPA back to its core --\nQ: Can you say that people who are working on this right now in the White House, all of them believe in manmade climate change?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I haven't talked to everyone in the White House.\nQ: Do you believe in manmade climate change?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's not relevant what I think.\nQ: I think it's pretty relevant, you're talking about it.\nI mean, can you answer the question? Do you believe in manmade climate change?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, sure, I do.\nQ: Yeah, so?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: But that doesn't say much, does it?\nQ: Well, it's pretty important if you're talking about it. Are you convinced --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, the issue really is as to what extent and how serious and the magnitude of it. And there are a lot of other questions that flow from that statement that I think are still unanswered and we still don't know the answers to.\nQ: So do you ultimately foresee the administration agreeing to an inside-the-fence regulation of power plants? Or is that even sort of too much to sort of --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, that's way too early to get into sort of what is next --\nQ: -- essentially a settlement in (inaudible.)\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I mean, the environmentalists could sue or petition the agency to try to force them to do something along those lines. But whether or not -- how that ends up in court, I don't know -- or what the administration -- what we do in terms of petition -- it's way too early to get into that.\nQ: Thank you.\nEND 6:26 P.M.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123625", "text": "James S. Brady Briefing Room\n1:34 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I hope everyone had a great weekend, seriously. It's Monday, so I brought a special guest.\nFirst, I'd like to have the Attorney General come up to the podium to make an announcement regarding immigration enforcement with respect to sanctuary cities. When the Attorney General is done speaking, we'll have time for a couple questions and then I'll continue with the briefing. So if your question is not germane to sanctuary cities, keep your hand down and we'll get to it after we go through the events of the day.\nSo, with that, Attorney General Sessions, come on up.\nATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS: Thank you, Sean. The Department of Justice has a view to enforce our nation's laws, including our immigration laws. Those laws require us to promptly remove aliens when they are convicted or detained of certain crimes. The vast majority of American people support this commonsense requirement. According to one recent poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities. Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate this enforcement of immigration laws. This includes refusing to detain known felons on the federal detainer request, or otherwise failing to comply with these laws.\nFor example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor ICE detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime. The charges and convictions against these aliens included drug-trafficking, hit-and-run, rape, sex offenses against a child, and even murder. Such policies cannot continue. They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. We all remember the tragic case of Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman who was shot and killed two years ago in San Francisco as she walked along a pier with her father. The shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions.\nJust 11 weeks before the shooting, San Francisco had released Sanchez from its custody, even though Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had filed a detainer requesting that he be held in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up for removal. Even worse, Sanchez admitted the only reason he came to San Francisco was because it was a sanctuary city.\nA similar story unfolded just last week, when Ever Valles, an illegal immigrant and a Mexican national was charged with murder and robbery of a man at a light rail station. Valles was released from a Denver jail in late December, despite the fact that ICE has lodged a detainer for his removal.\nThe American people are not happy with these results. They know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators.\nDUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang rapes, crimes against children, and murderers -- countless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended. Not only do these policies endanger lives of every American -- just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these policies also violate federal law.\nThe President has rightly said, disregard for the law must end. In his executive order, he stated that it is the policy of the executive branch to ensure that states and cities comply with all federal laws, including all immigration laws.\nToday, I'm urging states and local jurisdictions to comply with these federal laws, including 8 U.S.C. Section 1373. Moreover, the Department of Justice will require that jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department of Justice grants to certify compliance with 1373 as a condition of receiving those awards.\nThis policy is entirely consistent with the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Program's guidance that was issued just last summer under the previous administration. This guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants.\nIt also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants.\nThe Department of Justice will also take all lawful steps to claw back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates 1373. In the current fiscal year, the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Program and Community Oriented Policing services anticipates awarding more than $4.1 billion in grants.\nI strongly urge our nation's states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws, and to rethink these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe -- public safety, as well as national security, are at stake -- and put them at risk of losing federal dollars.\nThe American people want and deserve a lawful system of immigration that keeps us safe, and one that serves the national interest. This expectation is reasonable, just, and our government has the duty to meet it, and we will meet it.\nThank you.\nQ: In Montgomery County, right up the road, there was a rape in Maryland at Rockville High School. Has anyone from the Department of Justice had any conversations with anyone in Montgomery County or Rockville, as they describe themselves as a sanctuary county and city? And there's also a boatload of federal government in Montgomery County.\nATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS: Well, you know, Maryland is talking about a state law to make the state a sanctuary state. The governor is opposed to that, I'm glad to hear. That would be such a mistake. I would plead with the people of Maryland to understand that this makes the state of Maryland more at risk for violence and crime. It is not good policy. And as a former prosecutor for many years in state and federal law in jurisdictions, I just know the historic relationship different federal agencies have with regard to honoring detainers. It's just a fundamental principle of law enforcement that if you have a person arrested, and another jurisdiction has a charge, then they file a detainer. And when you finish with the prisoner, you turn them over to the next jurisdiction for their adjudication. That is why it should be done --\nMR. SPICER: Major.\nQ: Mr. Attorney General, so listening to you carefully, it sounds like you're applying the standards and the policy that the Obama administration put forward on compliance with underlying Justice Department rules. Are you taking any additional steps? And have you asked the President to maybe talk about other federal funds that are not necessarily under your control as a way to punish sanctuary cities or states?\nATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS: Well, that's a good question. What I'm saying today is that essentially the policies of the Obama administration that were issued last July make clear that you should not be receiving certain federal funds if you're not in compliance with 1373. We believe that grants in the future could be issued that have additional requirements, as every grant that's being issued in America today usually has a requirement that if you qualify for this grant, you have to meet certain requirements. So we'll be looking at that in the future, and we'll continue to pursue it. But fundamentally we intend to use all the lawful authority we have to make sure that our state and local officials, who are so important to law enforcement, are in sync with the federal government.\nQ: Some officials in cities, for example -- bigger cities -- have said, despite the lack of federal funding, they will continue to be sanctuary cities; that they don't care that they're losing money, essentially. What recourse does the Department of Justice have in those cities that look at what you're doing and say, we don't care, we're going to continue to implement this policy?\nATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS: Well, that's very disheartening, but I hope that the American people and their constituents in their own cities will communicate with them. And as we continue a dialogue and a discussion, and as we continue to ensure that monies that go for law enforcement only go to cities who are participating in an effective, collegial, cooperative way with the federal government, that that would also send a message. We have simply got to end this policy. Thank you all.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. You guys ready to continue?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: Good. Before I get into today's schedule, I wanted to read -- I know there's been some interest in the State Department's statement regarding the arrest of hundreds of protestors -- peaceful protestors -- that occurred in Russia.\nThe statement that the State Department put out says:\n\"The United States strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protestors throughout Russia on Sunday. The detention of peaceful protestors, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to essential democratic values. We are troubled to hear of the arrest of the opposition leader upon arrival at the demonstration, as well as the police raids on the anti-corruption organization he heads. The United States will monitor the situation, and we call on the government of Russia to immediately release all peaceful protestors. The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve a government that supports an open marketplace of ideas, transparent and accountable governance, equal treatment under the law, and the ability to exercise their rights without fear of retribution.\"\nNow, with respect to events for the day, this morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President participated in a roundtable with women small business owners. The President is hosting a group of women business owners as part of the White House's full calendar of Women's History Month events.\nAt the roundtable this morning, Vice President Pence, SBA Administrator McMahon joined with other senior administration officials to hear from these amazing female entrepreneurs and small business leaders about their firsthand experiences, successes, and challenges. As the President said, \"Empowering and promoting women in business is an absolute priority in the Trump administration because I know how crucial women are as job-creators, role models, and leaders all throughout our communities.\nThe women in attendance this morning have incredible stories, including many who have started businesses from scratch with very limited resources, and, through hard work and determination, turned their dreams into reality. Between them, they provide hundreds of jobs to Americans across the country. The President is dedicated to continuing to remove the unique barriers that women face in our economy, including access to capital, markets, and networks. This administration will continue to advocate for policies that support working family, including a national initiative to promote women business leaders and entrepreneurs that his daughter, Ivanka, is helping to lead.\nIn honor of Women's History Month, the White House has been hosting events all throughout March. Just to name a few, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Systems Administrator Verma held a roundtable with Women in Healthcare, which the President attended. The First Lady held a Women's Empowerment lunch on International Women's Day. Earlier this month, Second Lady Karen Pence joined women from all five military branches for lunch at Fort Meade, and last week hosted military women at the Vice President's residence to thank them for their service. Under President Trump, the American economy is a place for everyone, regardless of their gender, to thrive.\nFollowing the roundtable, the President had lunch with the Vice President and Secretary of State Tillerson. And at three o'clock, the President will sign House Joint Resolutions 37, 44, 57, and 58 -- all of which use the powers of the Congressional Review Act to roll back job-killing rules. Before this administration, only one time in the nation's history had a President ever signed a bill that used the Congressional Review Act to cancel a federal regulation. In just his first 66 days as President, he will have signed six resolutions to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome rules.\nHouse Joint Resolution 37 rolls back the so-called \"blacklisting\" rule, which manufacturers identified during their meeting with the President as one of the most significant threats to growing American businesses and hiring more American workers. The rule simply made it too easy for trial lawyers to go after American companies and American workers who contract with the federal government. The President saw that workers, taxpayers, and businesses were the ones who truly suffered under this rule, and he is glad to be signing legislation to eliminate it.\nHouse Joint Resolution 45* [44], 57, and 58 cancel federal power grabs that took decision-making away from the states and local governments who know the unique challenges of their own populations. The President firmly believes that Washington is not always the solution to these problems, and that these bills return the power to the people by putting more decision-making in the hands of states.\nHouse Joint Resolution 44 removes a Bureau of Land Management rule, known as \"Planning 2.0,\" that would have centralized federal and land management in Washington, diluting the concerns of local citizens who have a right that is protected by law to be involved in this decision-making process.\nH.J. Res. 57 and 58 eliminate the Department of Education regulations which limits states' flexibility in how they assess the performance of schools and teacher preparation and programs. Removing these additional layers of bureaucracy will make it easier for parents, teachers and communities, and state leaders to address the needs of their students.\nThe President will continue to work with Congress and the rest of the federal government until every unnecessary regulation that stands in the way of success for American business and American people is taken off the books.\nAdditionally, the President spoke with German Chancellor Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Modi earlier today to congratulate them on their parties' success in recent elections. We'll have readouts on those calls a little later for you both.\nThe President also will announce the establishment of the Office of American Innovation. The Office of American Innovation will apply the President's \"ahead of schedule and under budget\" mentality to a wide number of government operations and service, enhancing the quality of life for all Americans. The office will have a particular focus on technology and data, hearing back from leaders in the industry.\nAs some of its first priorities, the office will focus on modernizing the technology of every federal department, identifying transformational infrastructure projects, and reimagining the VA system so that it can better serve our nation's heroes. The effort will be led by Assistant to the President and Senior Adviser Jared Kushner.\nTomorrow, the President will sign an executive order to strengthen the nation's energy security by reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles that restrict the responsible use of domestic energy resources. This order will help keep energy and electricity affordable, reliable and clean in order to boost economic growth and job creation.\nAnd finally, before I came out today, Senate Democrats continued their obstruction to the President's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court with the Judiciary Committee seeking a one-week postponement on its decision.\nOver the weekend, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer defended his decision to mount a filibuster against the President's unquestionably qualified nominee. If Senator Schumer gets his way, this would be the first successful filibuster against a Supreme Court nominee in American history. He argued, quite misleadingly, that the Senate has \"required\" a 60-vote threshold of \"every\" Supreme Court nominee. That's simply not true.\nAnd as I've said before, only three Supreme Court Justices have faced a filibuster in the last half of the century. Senator Schumer cited four justices confirmed under President Bush and Obama, but in fact, among those four, only one faced an attempted filibuster -- that was Justice Samuel Alito. And it was President Obama who, then as a senator, voted to filibuster Justice Alito, and later publicly expressed his regret for that.\nThe fact is, an attempted filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee is rare, and to do so in this context, with such an eminently qualified and brilliant judge, is nothing short of obstructionism. That's why Senator Pat Leahy, the former Democratic Chairman of the Senate Judiciary, said he is \"not inclined to filibuster,\" even if he ultimately may not vote to confirm the Judge.\nThe fact that the former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee won't stand by the Minority Leader exposes the Leader's efforts as nothing but obstructionism that undermines decades of Senate tradition. Through four days of extensive hearings, Judge Gorsuch demonstrated his judicial philosophy, his sterling academic credentials, and a brilliant legal mind. He deserves a fair up or down vote.\nAnd with that, I'd be glad to take a few of your questions. Jonathan.\nQ: Is the President serious about working with Democrats going forward after what happened with healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. In fact, starting Friday afternoon through late yesterday, he's received a number of calls, as well as other members of the senior staff that had been working on healthcare, from members of both sides, saying that they would like to work together, offer up ideas, and had suggestions about how to come to resolution on this and get to a House vote on this.\nQ: But --\nQ: But wouldn't this require a --\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, John, this isn't a free-for-all. Jonathan is asking the question.\nQ: But wouldn't this require a serious course correction for the White House? I mean, the President branded Chuck Schumer a \"clown,\" worked entirely with Republicans on this bill. Wouldn't this require a serious change of course for the President?\nMR. SPICER: To some degree, sure. And I think the President talked about that. I think we learned a lot through this process. I think we're obviously looking at ways that we can improve not only how we handle healthcare, but other things -- how we do everything. And I mentioned it to some of you in the course of things. I think one of the traits of a successful organization is to always examine how you do things, but I think that there's been a lot of outreach from members of both sides with ideas, and the President is willing to listen to these individuals. And if they can come to a resolution on a way forward, obviously we're willing to listen and to move forward.\nBut there are a lot of folks that came forward with these ideas. And with all due respect, to the beginning of your question, I don't think it's a one-way street some of the comments that have been made. I think some of the Democrats. who now say they weren't involved, early on in the process said that they wanted nothing to do with this process, there was no way that they would engage in any discussion to repeal. So I think it's a two-way street, and I think that we have been willing to listen to folks and their ideas. And the President's advice is that if we can come up with resolution on a way to move forward, we'll certainly entertain that.\nQ: Where does the buck stop for this failure? Does the buck stop --\nMR. SPICER: Just so we're clear, look, we're at the beginning of a process. I don't think we've seen the end of healthcare. As most people have noted, I think the Obama administration, from beginning to end, it ultimately took about 17 months and went through a series of fits and starts. And it wasn't until Scott Brown was elected, denying them the 60th vote in the Senate, that they finally jammed something through. And, frankly, a lot of the reason that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has some of the powers that they do is because they had to jam it through. But there were several failures, when Obamacare went through, during the process. And ultimately, they tried to go through a single-payer process, and they got rebuffed on that by some of their own members.\nSo, look, we're not saying it's the end of healthcare. But I think that we are looking to look for a way forward, and I think that a lot of the members -- and again, on both sides of the aisle -- have reached out not just to the President, but to members of the team, willing to share some ideas both that will make -- that they think would make the bill stronger. But ultimately, the goal is to get to 216 and potentially 218, depending on where we are with special elections.\nAnd so we're going to look to see where we can get those 218 votes. And there may be other opportunities to work with people across the aisle that get us to 218. But that's the name of the game, and we're going to continue to pursue that.\nJim.\nQ: Sean, the last Congress passed significant tax reform, it took about five years, and that was 30 years ago, in 1986. After the failure or defeat of the American Health Care Act on an issue where there was broad GOP consensus, what makes the President think he can pass significant tax reform this year?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think it's been 30 years. I think people -- we have a series of -- we have an economy that's evolved, especially in the technology area; they just made a lot of things change. And I think our tax code is outdated. And, frankly, on the business side, we're uncompetitive. There's a reason that companies are leaving America to go to other places, because the same reason sometimes companies move from state to state. Our corporate and regulatory system has become unattractive for a lot of companies that want to either manufacture here, grow here, or begin here, or want to return jobs here.\nI think the President recognized that, and business leaders from around the country. It's not a partisan issue. I mean, you go out to the tech sector, out in Silicon Valley in particular, there's a lot of these companies out there that admittedly weren't with the President during the election, or continued not to be, and I think recognized that we are not as competitive as we can be when you consider the tax and regulatory climate of other countries around the world. And we need to be more competitive.\nAnd then I think you look at the individual side of the House, and I think especially when you talk to middle-income Americans, especially in the context of health premiums skyrocketing up, they recognize that they need some relief. And so we've got to do what we can to address that.\nJon-Christopher.\nQ: Thank you. Historically, since healthcare has beguiled many Presidents, all the way to Harry Truman, and certainly when Hillary Clinton came to Washington, she went to the Hill and thought that she could get it done. I'm sure there are many lessons you can learn from previous Presidents and perhaps previous First Ladies. Has the President thought about reaching out to Hillary and finding out how she maneuvered and some of the best practices or some of the pitfalls that she came to?\nMR. SPICER: And I think that you know -- I mean, he's met with Dr. Zeke Emanuel and others -- it's not been a -- he's reached out to several people throughout this process to gauge both their policy ideas and strategy ideas. And I think the President noted on Friday afternoon that we learned a lot, on several fronts, about strategically how to handle this, as well as some of the members that we thought we would have with us. And we're reexamining that on a variety of bases.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thank you. We got some guidance from the White House earlier about Chairman Nunes's meeting on the White House grounds, involving (inaudible) any idea that questions about the meeting should be referred to the Committee Chairman. But I wanted to ask a slightly different question, which is, does the White House know now what absolutely happened? Do you have issues with the idea that someone, perhaps in the executive branch, shared information from the White House grounds without you knowing about it? Or are you investigating this? Do you believe there was a leak? Or was it, in fact, someone on the White House staff or NSC staff, or on loan to either, who provided the information and therefore it's not leaked?\nMR. SPICER: So, obviously, all of what I know has been available through public comments. I know that Chairman Nunes confirmed that he was on White House grounds Tuesday. And, frankly, any questions regarding who he met with or why he was here should be referred to him. I've seen some of the comments that he's made to your outlet in particular about who he met with. And I would refer you to his comments that he's made. I'm not going to get into who he met with or why he met with them. I think that's something that he had made very clear, and I'll let him answer it. He is the one who has discussed what he is reviewing. And so I will leave it up to him and not try to get in the middle of that.\nQ: Can I just follow up, just to close the circle on it? I'm asking a slightly different question, or at least I'm trying to ask a slightly different question, which is, does the White House know what happened now, beyond public accounts? And are you satisfied that you don't have an inappropriate leak in the executive branch?\nMR. SPICER: No, we're not concerned about that. I know that he is -- again, everything that I know about what he has done is through public reports that he has made on the record to different folks when he said he has multiple sources, he had met with different folks to gather things as part of his review of the situation. And so all I know, and what I'm willing to communicate, is what has been made available through on-the-record comments that he has made.\nQ: But to come to White House grounds you have to be cleared --\nMR. SPICER: No, not necessarily. I don't know that members of Congress need to be cleared.\nQ: Wouldn't the White House want to know?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think there's a difference. He's doing a review, and it's not something that we're going to necessarily get in the middle of or get in the way of. Part of it is to let him review and have conversations and look at things that he thinks are relevant.\nQ: Sean, a clarification on your answer to Margaret. You said, I don't know that members of Congress have to get cleared in. There was some question about that. Who in the White House signed him in, essentially, to be able to --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that you have to. I'll be glad to check on that. I'm not sure that that's how that works. But I will follow up on that point.\nQ: Okay, and my second question is -- and it's related to this -- I understand that you're not going to speak about some of the swirl surrounding this issue with Chairman Nunes. Does the White House believe that he can still lead an impartial investigation? Or would the administration support some of these calls now for an independent committee to investigate this?\nMR. SPICER: First of all, I would question what \"this\" is. Because as I've mentioned countless times from this podium, there's two issues at hand -- there's multiple. Number one, there's any action with respect to Russia itself. And every single person that's been briefed by Director Comey in particular, and the FBI, has said there's nothing there. What he is looking into are two things that we are aware of because of the pleas that we have made. One is the leaks of classified and other information that have come out. And two is whether or not there has been people that have been unmasked, and whether or not there was surveillance -- I don't know why -- we stand by the original request that was made. And I think Director Comey, in open testimony the other day, talked about what the FBI is looking into.\nSo I think we have a lot of people looking into this whole situation.\nQ: Will the administration pursue, will the White House pursue a leak investigation into whoever is giving Chairman Nunes this information, if it's in the executive branch?\nMR. SPICER: At this point, we're letting his -- the review of this situation proceed. And we can address that after he decides to be clear about that.\nQ: Why is this leak okay, but other leaks are not?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a difference between a leak and someone pursuing a review of a situation that they have determined. There's a difference between a leak -- someone leaking out to reporters for nefarious -- to take classified information and share it with people who aren't cleared. Chairman Nunes is cleared; he's the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Someone who is cleared to shared classified information with somebody else cleared is not a leak.\nZeke.\nQ: I have two for you. Just a quick housekeeping note. At the beginning of the briefing, you read out that the State Department stated on the protests and arrests in Russia. Does that reflect the White House's views?\nMR. SPICER: That reflects the view of the United States government.\nQ: Okay, just wanted to clarify that. And secondly, back on -- you mentioned there were lessons learned off of what went down last week, the last several weeks, around healthcare. Can you give us some specifics on what some of those lessons are in terms of the President talked a lot about he learned a lot about loyalty, I think is one of the lines he stated on Friday? Does he believe that some members of his party are no longer loyal to him? Will you go through what are some of the lessons that --\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not going to detail, go through -- I mean, obviously this is an internal thing. But I will say that we look at things like -- everything from who we met with and when we met with them, to whether or not we should have -- how everything was rolled out and what organizations were met with, what commitments were met and when. But there's a lot that goes into this. And you look at whether or not that's applicable to another situation, whether that's unique. But obviously, yeah, you do look at some of the individuals that you met with, both in terms of timing, in terms of commitment, in terms of substance, and evaluate just the process itself, but then also, to some degree, the individuals and whether or not that is someone that --\nQ: Who's leading that review?\nMR. SPICER: There's several folks. Again, it depends on the aspect of it. There's a legislative affairs team, there's a public policy team, there's a comms aspect to this. But we all internally talk about what went well, what didn't. And we do that not just with the bad, but the good.\nI mean, I think Jonathan asked it somewhere at the beginning, but I think most organizations -- whether or not you do something really well or not as well -- it's usually incumbent upon you to think, what did we do well so that for things that we did really well, we sustain those kinds of aspects of something -- because there's always something to improve -- and even when you don't do as well. But there's part of things that you did that you did well and you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water. So there's an ongoing piece to this.\nMajor.\nQ: Just a quick follow-up on Chairman Nunes, and then I have a question about Jared in a second. So, yes, members of Congress may not need to be cleared in, but to get access to a SCIF, I do believe that requires some cooperation from the executive branch, because there are intelligence places on Capitol Hill that are secure, that his meeting could have taken place. So it creates the impression that Chairman Nunes came over here and, with some degree of cooperation with this White House, was able to carry out this meeting and then make the announcement that he did, which is perceived by some -- most of them Democrats, I'll grant you that -- that it was trying to be helpful to this President and this administration. So it appears there was some degree of cooperation in this process that the White House granted Chairman Nunes, making it not just an investigative action, but a cooperative one.\nMR. SPICER: Right. So I would refer you to two things. Number one, we've asked both of these entities, both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees, to undertake this review. So it is partially at our request that they're looking into this.\nNumber two, based on the public comments that he made to Margaret's organization, he has said, from my understanding, on the record, that he did not meet with White House staff. So, again, I think you're trying to making something that he -- is himself, from what I've read, not actually been the case.\nQ: That's not what I asked you. I asked you about cooperation to have access to a SCIF, which is something that has to be carried out with your --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. I will be glad to take a look at that and figure out whether or not that is an accurate statement or not.\nQ: Okay. Let me ask you about Jared. There is an understanding that's trying to be worked out, as we understand it, between Jared and the Senate Intelligence Committee. Is that a testimony? Is that something that the committee has requested? Has he volunteered? Does he believe he has something to explain to that committee and, more broadly, the American public about what he did on behalf of the transition with whom he met with, and some of the meetings that he took that are raising questions about Russia and folks that he met with that are outside of diplomatic channels but have other aspects to their Russian business deals that may cause some stir?\nMR. SPICER: So, throughout the campaign and the transition, Jared served as the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials until we had State Department officials up. Once we assumed --\nQ: (Inaudible) request?\nMR. SPICER: That's correct. And so given this role, he volunteered to speak with Chairman Burr's committee, but has not received any confirmation regarding a time for a meeting or anything.\nQ: And is this going to be a private meeting, or is this going to be --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. Again --\nQ: What is he trying to accomplish with that?\nMR. SPICER: I think based on the questions that surround this, he volunteered to go in and sit down with them and say, hey, I'm glad to talk about the role that I played and the individuals I met with. But again, remember, given the role that he played both during the campaign and during the transition, he met with countless individuals. That was part of his job. That was part of his role. And he executed it completely as he was supposed to.\nQ: And so he doesn't believe he owes the American public an explanation?\nMR. SPICER: For what? Doing his job?\nQ: I'm just asking.\nMR. SPICER: But you're acting as though there's something nefarious about doing what he was actually tasked to do.\nQ: Well, it's not every day that someone in a senior position like Jared's volunteers to go talk to the Senate Intelligence Committee about an investigation dealing with meddling by a foreign power in an American election.\nMR. SPICER: And I think based on the media frenzy around this, he --\nQ: I'm just asking.\nMR. SPICER: And I'm answering it. And I'm just saying to you that based on the media frenzy that existed around this, he volunteered to make sure that they -- he said, hey, we've made some contacts, I'd be glad to explain them, let me know if you'd like to talk. Plain and simple.\nQ: Just to be clear, just to kind of follow up on what everyone has been asking about Chairman Nunes -- so the White House does not -- does the White House have knowledge of the information that Chairman Nunes received when he came to the White House the first time? And if that's the case, or if that's not the case, is your position that the White House is not going to look into where he got the information from or who gave him the information until his investigation is complete?\nMR. SPICER: I think that -- I'm not aware of where he got it from. I know in his public statements he's talked about having multiple sources. And so I don't know how he derived the conclusion that he did. And I think that at this point, the goal would be to wait until the review that he is undertaking is completed.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Why would Nunes need to brief the President on documents he viewed on White House grounds?\nMR. SPICER: Because that's a big assumption that you're making that that's the only thing. As I said just a second ago, he had multiple sources on multiple topics. We don't know what he briefed him on in its totality. And so to jump to that conclusion is, frankly, irresponsible.\nQ: One more question. When will the White House resume releasing visitor logs?\nMR. SPICER: We're reviewing that now.\nAlexis.\nQ: Just to follow up -- I have two questions. One is on taxes. But last week you were advising the press corps that it didn't make sense for Nunes to come to the White House to brief the President on something that he had obtained from the White House, from the administration. So my question to you is -- I know what you just said, but can you say factually, absolutely flatly, that it is not possible that Chairman Nunes came to brief the President on something that he obtained from the White House or the administration?\nMR. SPICER: I can't say 100 percent that I know anything what he briefed him on. What I can tell you through his public comments is that he has said that he had multiple sources that he came to a conclusion on. So to the degree to which any of those sources weighed on the ultimate outcome of what he came to a decision on, I don't know. And that's something that, frankly, I don't even know that he discussed with the President.\nQ: So it's possible? As far as you know right now, it's possible?\nMR. SPICER: Anything is possible.\nQ: Okay. Here's my question on taxes. The President has said in the past that he thought maybe tax reform would flow over into 2018 -- calendar year 2018. And we know from the President's admiration of the 1986 tax reform, that took more than two years. Can you answer two questions about tax reform? Does the President anticipate that it will take that long, going into 2018 or beyond? And who is going to write the tax legislation? Who is going to devise the plan that the President wants to put his name on?\nMR. SPICER: Well, so on the first one, I know that Secretary Mnuchin has talked about August as a target date. And I think it depends. I mean, as you point out, these are big things. There's a lot of groups that are going to want a ton of input because of the very nature that it's been 30 years. But I think part of this is going to be dependent on whether -- the degree to which we can come to consensus on a lot of big issues. But I know that we have a goal and it will depend on a lot of these issues, both on the corporate side and on the individual side, how that process evolves.\nSo to predict it -- I know the Secretary would like to have it done. He'll play a huge role in this. Gary Cohn will play a big role in it. I think our legislative affairs team will play a role in it. There's a lot of folks on the team -- Secretary Ross on the Commerce side. There's a lot of individuals -- he's assembled a world-class Cabinet that has a lot of interest in helping to grow the economy to attract jobs, create a more favorable tax climate here in the country, but also provide tax relief for middle-class Americans.\nSo we're not there yet.\nQ: So will it would be the Trump plan?\nMR. SPICER: What?\nQ: Will it be the President's plan?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, obviously we're driving the train on this. So, I mean, we're going to work with Congress on this. But I think the President, as you've heard multiple times the President be very clear -- this is a huge priority for him and something that he feels very passionately about. And so we'll have more on that later.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, the documents that Chairman Nunes saw here at the White House complex are described by his office as being executive branch documents. In the early days after the President sent out that tweet, the White House was digging around for anything to corroborate what the President had tweeted out. Why did it take the Intelligence Committee Chairman coming here to the White House to view executive branch documents to uncover this information? Why couldn't the White House?\nMR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned I think to Margaret, I'm not going to -- I will stick to what the Chairman has said publicly. And my understanding from his public comments are that there are certain systems that he doesn't have access to. That was his explanation, and I'm going to -- I think you should follow up with him on that.\nQ: Did the White House ever search the same documents that the Chairman searched?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what he found, so therefore it would be hard to say -- to make an assessment of what he was briefed on or what we know. So that's a really hard question to answer at this point.\nQ: Is it possible that these documents were merely surveillance reports that were --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into hypotheticals, John. I don't know what he found. And to start to say what's possible, what's not, I don't know.\nQ: Well, let me just finish, if I could. Is it possible that these were surveillance reports from security clearances that were collected after people had filled out Standard Form 86?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I don't know what he -- I honestly don't know what he's got on his systems and what the intel community has on theirs that he wouldn't have access to. So I don't know what he would have had access to already.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On tax cuts, it looks like you guys got a little bit of political cover from the House Freedom Caucus over the weekend to do this without paying for all of it -- that is, adding to the deficit. What's the right number from the White House's perspective to add to the deficit in order to do tax cuts? How high are you willing to go in terms of deficit?\nMR. SPICER: It's a really early question to be asking at this point. I think the question is, as we construct this both on the corporate side and then on the individual side, I think part of it is it's going to be an equation that isn't just driven by that, but more what's going to attract jobs, what's going to help us build, what's going to grow the economy. I think we're growing around -- potentially, growing around 2.6, and the President really would like to see that growth right up in the high 3s, 4s, and 5s. And so there's a question about what part of tax reform, especially on the corporate side, will help us spur the economy and grow jobs.\nAnd I think that's an ongoing discussion. I think that's more of the driver of this. And then I think as it evolves we'll have the score and we'll know more.\nQ: Are you comfortable entirely adding to the deficit? Or do you think something needs to be offset, maybe some other spending cuts somewhere else?\nMR. SPICER: You're asking really early in the process to make that kind of analysis before we have a policy set forth or have any kind of notion of what a score would look like.\nOlivier.\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, Sean. There's been an escalation of the American role in the war against the Islamic State. You've seen Marines come ashore in Syria. There have been changes to rules of engagement. I'm trying to understand the relationship between that change and the President's ISIS strategy review. Has he personally signed off on all the changes in America's posture in the field since January 20th? Is that something that's left up to the commanders in the field? I don't understand the relationship between --\nMR. SPICER: Well, it depends on which mission you're talking about, specifically, or --\nQ: Marines left in, I think, October. They obviously went ashore much more recently than that. So did he have to sign off on that?\nMR. SPICER: I think it depends on -- I mean, he speaks with General Mattis, his national security team very regularly. I'm not going to get into some of the details of what comes up in those settings. But I will say that, as I've noted in the past, I think philosophically the President has made it very clear that he wants to give the commanders on the ground much more flexibility to execute their mission, especially when it comes to defeating ISIS. That's a very big change in philosophy, but I think it also depends on the magnitude of the mission, the number of ground troops in particular. And so this is an ongoing discussion that he has with Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford and others.\nQ: So, on the review, are you waiting -- is the President waiting until the review is complete before you announce sort of a new posture and new strategy? Or is it as conclusions come in you're adapting day to day?\nMR. SPICER: I think some of it is an ongoing discussion that he's having with both Chairman Dunford of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary Mattis of DOD. At certain times when they meet they'll update him on certain things and give him an update on where they're headed right now. As the review is ongoing, there's certain events that are part of -- will be part and parcel of the review in terms of where we're going, and so they'll update him on that and talk to him about the tweaks.\nGabi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. President Trump has sent out two tweets now criticizing members of the House Freedom Caucus for preventing Planned Parenthood from being defunded by opposing the AHCA. Is that something that he would want to see tacked on as a rider to next month's spending bill?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that he's made very clear what his position is on Planned Parenthood, and obviously this was an opportunity to defund it. But I don't want to get ahead of our legislative strategy. We'll look at other opportunities. But this is definitely one that was a way to make that happen.\nSteve.\nQ: On that legislative strategy and the idea of working with Democrats, there's a school of thought in this town that last week proved that the President is lacking in political capital. So I have two questions. One is, what's in it for Democrats to work with the President now? And two, if fully pursued and to get things through the House, Democrats and Republicans work together, wouldn't that tend to undermine the job security of Speaker Ryan if the House Freedom Caucus is frozen out?\nMR. SPICER: Well, so two things. Number one, I think the message that sends to the American -- as I mentioned to, I think it was Jonathan, at the beginning, it's a two-way street. We heard -- when you see whether it's Judge Gorsuch, which they're throwing down decades of Senate tradition by saying we're just going to filibuster this guy -- I don't think there's anyone in America that can honestly look at his qualifications and suggest that he's not qualified as a jurist on the Supreme Court. I mean, there's nothing that anyone has seen or laid a glove on him through these four days that suggests that he's not qualified to serve.\nAnd I think that it's a -- and again, with Obamacare, repealing and replacing it, several of the leading Democrats came out from the get-go and said, we have no interest in doing that. So I think there's a point at which both parties can look back and figure out whether or not it's worth engaging. I think the President, as I mentioned, is eager to get to 218 on a lot of his initiatives, whether it's tax reform, infrastructure. There are a lot of things. And I think that he is going to be willing to listen to other voices on the other side to figure out if people want to work with him to get these big things done, to make Washington work, to enhance the lives of the American people, then he's going to work with them.\nI think he had a great meeting with the CBC the other day, for example, where he talked about infrastructure. He talked about loans and small business lending, education. There are things that he is willing to engage individuals with -- or groups or caucuses -- to get to 218 and further advance his agenda.\nSo it's not about undermining anybody. It's about moving the agenda forward and getting things done.\nQ: It's Speaker Ryan who puts bills on the floor, not the President. So what's in it for Speaker Ryan?\nMR. SPICER: Getting things done. I think there is still a sense of doing what's in the best interest of this country that exists. So I mean, let's just make sure that we understand -- I think that his goal -- he came here to get things done. And I think as was pointed out, there was a level of disappointment that he expressed on Friday. He wants to get things done. If people want to work together -- and I think what this event on Friday did was, frankly, draw more people into the process, to saying, okay, let's figure out if we can actually come together with some consensus ideas to get to 218, whether or not they come from one side of the aisle or the other, to pass this bill and make a better system.\nHe understands -- and frankly, I think a lot of Democrats do -- that there's an opportunity here. With healthcare being such a big issue, with Obamacare being such a looming disaster, that we have an opportunity to do some stuff. And if Democrats want to join in, then that's great and we'll do that.\nMike.\nQ: You've talked quite a bit up there about the wide latitude that Secretary Price has to dismantle Obamacare from this spot. Is that still the case? Will he continue to try to dismantle Obamacare while you're trying to work with moderate Democrats on healthcare reform? And also, the healthcare bill would have repealed almost all those Obamacare taxes. Do you want to see those repealed as part of the tax reform bill?\nMR. SPICER: I think Secretary Price is up here today. There's a lot of meetings that are already taking place internally with the team. There's a lot of options that are on the table in terms of -- especially when it comes to what we call phase one and phase two, trying to get some of that stuff out the door. And as we look back on -- talking about lessons learned, I think one of them is to try to get some of the phase one and phase two meshed together and pushed out.\nHow we do that, whether we wait for the revival of legislation before we put it up -- remember, I think -- just so we're clear, and I mentioned earlier on this -- Obamacare had a ton of fits and starts during its process. It was left for dead multiple times, but they pressed forward. I don't think that that's necessarily a model to look for in terms of how they jammed it down, but I do think that we have to recognize that we were 17, 18 days into this process.\nI think the President has made very clear it's not over, there are people coming to the table, but he's going to listen to all good ideas across the spectrum to figure out what it takes to get to 218. And we'll see where we go from there.\nJohn.\nQ: The tax question, to follow up on the -- the healthcare bill would have repealed those Obamacare taxes?\nMR. SPICER: And I think that's part and parcel of that discussion, is how we look at both the taxes and some of the phase one stuff. But we're not ready to announce anything now.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Yeah, as far as Jared Kushner's offer to meet with Chairman Burr and talk with the Senate Intelligence Committee, is there any particular reason why the White House would not be opposed to the idea of Jared Kushner testifying, under oath, before that committee?\nMR. SPICER: Again, Jared volunteered to meet with the committee. They haven't even confirmed having a meeting yet, so to get ahead of what they've even asked for would be a little silly.\nQ: But does it set, in the White House's view, a dangerous precedent in having a senior aide to the President going up? Ordinarily, we see, sometimes, the White House invoking executive privilege. Why haven't you done this in this particular case?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think Jared did a job during the transition in the campaign where he was a conduit to leaders, and that's until we had a State Department -- a functioning place for people to go. Remember, we had a delay in some of these things, and that was his role. And he wants to make sure that he's very clear about the role that he played, who he talked to, and that's it.\nJim.\nQ: Is Obamacare repeal dead?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think it's dead in the sense --\nQ: Or it would have to be dead if you're going to have Democrats working with you to address the Affordable Care Act.\nMR. SPICER: Why? No, no, no, I don't know that that's true because I think it's --\nQ: Why would they work with you if --\nMR. SPICER: Because it's dying.\nQ: -- you're still trying to repeal it?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think part of it is, is there's a recognition that it is failing. It's dying on its own. It will be dead soon.\nQ: A lot of Democrats say it's not dying.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, well, then a lot of Democrats need to get more money, because --\nQ: There are repairs that need to be made, they say, but to kill the whole thing might not be the route they want to go.\nMR. SPICER: I understand what they want, but I think there's a difference. I think that we recognize that premiums continue to go sky-high, deductibles are going sky-high, choices are going down. By Leader Pelosi's own metric, this is dying. She's the one who crafted the metric. She said that there was a three-pronged system to determining its success. It is an abysmal failure. If they want to come back to the table and recognize how we can do it in a more responsible way to achieve the goals that Obamacare set out to do -- but do so in a way that is going to do the opposite of what Obamacare actually did, which is to increase choice, drive down cost -- we're willing to have that discussion. But right now --\nQ: They say repeal has to be put to the side.\nMR. SPICER: Right. But, Jim, one of the things that I mentioned -- I just want to be clear on this -- is we have to figure out how we get to 216, 218, depending on where the number is that given day. That doesn't mean we need the entire Democratic Caucus. That means we need some responsible Democrats who want to sit down and have a discussion about how to do that. And I think that there may be enough of them that are willing to do that, but I understand where the Democratic leadership is, and that's one thing.\nI mean, they continue to stake out a very, very far-left position. That's not where all their members are. And I think that we can -- based on the calls that have come in over the last 50, 60 hours, I think that there might be some room to have a conversation with people who want to engage in a constructive conversation on how to move forward.\nSo let's see how that evolves. I don't know that we're ready to jump into this today, but I think as the calls come forward, the President's view is, if you all want to get together and start coming to a way that we can come to resolution, we're willing to listen. But right now, we've got an agenda to continue to pursue.\nQ: There might be a middle ground there you think?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to jump ahead, but I will say that we believe that there is something that could still be done at some point, and I think the further along we go, where premiums continue to go up, more and more people will be drawn into this discussion because there is going to be a continued cry from people in terms of the impact that it's having on their pocketbook and on their ability to see people that -- a doctor of their choice or a plan that's just not seeing them anymore.\nQ: A real quick follow-up on Chairman Nunes. Do you reject that there is any kind of perception problem whatsoever in having the Chairman over here the day before he comes out publicly and says, by the way, there's this information that's helpful to the President?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the Chairman has made very clear through his public comments what his goal was, and I think anyone who wants to -- I mean, you can't ask someone to do a review of the situation, and then sort of create inferences because they're reviewing a situation that there's something that's not right about that. He is reviewing a situation. He did exactly -- and I think he's been fairly open with the press as far as what he was doing, who he spoke to, and why. And I think, you know, from our standpoint, that's what we had asked to do, is a review.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, several topics. One --\nMR. SPICER: Shocker. (Laughter.)\nQ: Don't be. You heard the question that I lobbed at the Attorney General about the hate crime that happened in New York -- the white supremacist who went to New York and targeted a black man. Hate crimes are on the rise. What do you say? What is this White House saying about this obvious apparent hate crime?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I mean, you yelled at the Attorney General a specific case, if I'm --\nQ: The White House in the past had talked about this. And you talked about issues of hate crimes --\nMR. SPICER: I'm glad to talk about the issues. I just want to be very clear that I am not going to reference any specific case before the DOJ right now. I will say that the President has recognized that we need to bring the country together. He wants to unite this country. He wants to bring people together. He had a very long conversation with respect to race in itself, which I think is somewhat -- if I'm not correct in your question --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Okay, I just want to be clear. Thank you. And I think that was one of the topics that he talked about with the CBC. Some of the issues, with respect to crime and education, and some of the solutions that they suggested that could be done during their meeting. And I think those are the kind of things that I think we can continue that conversation.\nQ: Sean, unfortunately there has been a rise in hate crimes when it comes to different groups, to include anti-Semitic crimes. You've commented from that podium -- this is clear -- this gentleman, in his jailhouse, gave a statement to a reporter talking about he wishes the man were younger and he was a thug that killed. So what do you say to this? This is clear -- it's racism at its ugliest.\nMR. SPICER: Two issues. Number one, I think hate crimes, anti-Semitic crimes of any nature should be called out in the most reprehensible way. There is no room for that in our country, and I think the President noted that in the Joint Address, that there is one issue that, despite policy, should unite us -- and that is calling out hate, that is calling out divisiveness based on the color of one's skin, one's religion, one's gender.\nThe President has been very clear on that, and he's called it out before. With respect to certain particular situations, he made it very clear. At the opening of his Joint Address, that's what he led with -- is a call to denounce hate no matter where we come from politically. He's also talked about it the night that he took the stage on that Wednesday morning around 2:40 a.m., about how one of the things that he needed to do and wanted to do as President was unite all Americans.\nBut I think that there's one other piece to this, April, that I just want to be clear on. While we unequivocally -- no question about it -- need to call out hate, anti-Semitism where it exists, there is another thing that we have to do, and, in your case in particular, while I don't know all of the details, and I don't want to reference any specific case -- but I think we saw this the other day with some of the anti-Semitic behavior that was going out with respect to people of the Jewish faith, is that we saw these threats coming into Jewish community centers, and there was an immediate jump to criticize folks on the right and to denounce people on the right and ask them to condemn them. And it turns out that, in fact, it wasn't someone on the right. And it was -- and the President, from the get-go, had said, I bet you it's not someone -- and he was right. And yet --\nQ: I'm not calling this --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, I understand that. And that's --\nQ: -- saying he's a white supremacist.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think, in those cases, there's no question -- black and white -- we need to call out all instances of this.\nThat being said, while we're on the topic, I do think that there has been a rush to judgement in a lot of other cases when it comes to -- in particular, some of the anti-Semitic discussion -- where people have jumped to the conclusion about denouncing people on the right and asking for this. And in that particular case, we saw that the President was right and that this rush to judgment by a lot of folks on the left was wrong, and none of them have been held to account on that. And that is something that equally needs to be called out.\nWhen people are charging something of someone that is not true, there has been nothing to go back to those individuals -- nothing -- on the left who came and asked for everyone on the right to denounce something that they weren't guilty of. And I think that there needs to be an equal -- go back in time and call out those individuals for rushing to judgment and calling out those individuals.\nQ: And my second topic, and I'm done. Someone who was in the room -- you like talking about the CBC meeting that happened last week. Someone who was actually in the room, at that meeting, said that the issue of HBCUs came up -- and that's a very sensitive subject right now in the black community and here at the White House. The issue of HBCUs came up, and Omarosa said that she would be the one heading the HBCU Office at the White House, and the President did not make a response confirming or denying. Will this be the case? Is this the case?\nMR. SPICER: We don't have any announcements to make. I assume that you're referring to the executive order, and we don't have anything to announce on that subject at this time.\nKristen.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Given that the Freedom Caucus blocked the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, does the President still believe he can work with the Freedom Caucus on future pieces of legislation?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's going to depend on what legislation --\nQ: So not necessarily?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I'm not going to -- it's not a question of -- we're going to work with anybody who wants to work with us on achieving the goals the President set out. I don't think -- we're not putting anyone and saying, \"We'll never work with you again.\" It is that balance --\nQ: Has he written them off?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't think he's written -- no, I think, as he mentioned, he learned a lot through this process about loyalty. And it's not just a bloc, it's certain individuals. And again, I'm not going to get into naming names, but I think the President learned a lot through this process.\nAnd one of the things that's interesting is, when you look back -- and I know there's been a lot to make of this -- the President also recognizes when there's not a deal to be made, when to walk away. That's one of the traits -- it's not just about making deals, it's knowing when to walk away from deals, and knowing when there's a bad deal that's the only solution.\nAnd I think the President understood that while you can get a deal at the time, that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal. And I think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had, and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at hand.\nQ: Let me ask you about this tweet over the weekend. Does he regret tweeting to his followers that they should tune in to Judge Jeanine only to tune in, and then have her call for House Speaker Paul Ryan to step down?\nMR. SPICER: He's a fan of the show. That's it, plain and simple. I mean --\nQ: But does he owe Speaker Ryan an apology then?\nMR. SPICER: He and Speaker Ryan talked extensively over the weekend.\nQ: Did they talk today?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know if they talked today. I think they talked both Saturday and Sunday at length. But again, he is a fan of the show. He tweeted out support of it. That's it, plain and simple.\nQ: A lot of people say it's a lot more than coincidence.\nMR. SPICER: I know what a lot of people say, Kristen. I just said it.\nQ: So does he owe the House Speaker an apology?\nMR. SPICER: No. He doesn't -- he has spoken -- for what? For supporting a show on Fox? No.\nDave.\nQ: And does he still have confidence they can work together, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Dave.\nQ: Two questions. One on the President choosing Jared Kushner for this new Office of American Innovation to reform government across the government. Obviously, Jared Kushner has 60-some days of experience in Washington -- never had a prior government job. Does the President view that, somehow, as an advantage in this case?\nMR. SPICER: In some cases, when you look at the individuals that he's bringing in. Again, I think one of the things that Jared -- and again, they may talk more about this later -- but one of the things that Jared is looking at is some of the procurement -- the technology aspects. And if you've ever really dealt with the government and recognized how outdated and un-modernized some of this is, it is not serving the American people, it is not serving the constituents that many departments have. And I think looking at how we procure different things and procure technology in particular is important.\nIt's an important way -- I mean, I think when you look at the VA, in particular, and recognize how it handles certain things -- there are certain things it does really well, by the way. It buys prescription drugs really well. It buys them in bulk -- gets the job done. But there's certain things that it may not do as well in terms of how it keeps its records and how it serves veterans, how it lends money, et cetera -- that we can look at and figure out is there a better way.\nGovernment is not business, right? We recognize that there are certain things that business would never do in terms of what government has to do, because we serve all of our people. But there are certain practices that we can put in place that can help us deliver a better product, a better service to the American people in some of these key areas. And I think that when you look at some of the business acumen that Jared and some of the other individuals who he is bringing into this process can really -- I think it is a great service to this country.\nThere are so many individuals that Jared has talked that have done so well and been so blessed by our nation that have wanted to give back in some way, shape, or form, and are using this opportunity to help our country and serve our country in ways that they believe they can use their expertise to do.\nQ: On healthcare, this review that you've talked about -- what went right, what went wrong -- I know you don't want to name names, but would it be fair to say, at this point, that the President has written off some people?\nMR. SPICER: I just -- I think I answered that question. It's not a question of written them off, it's a question of understanding -- there's sort of an understanding of how you deal with certain people and how they dealt with you. But it's not a question of writing them off. We're going to need to get to -- as time goes on, we'll get to -- I'm just going to keep saying 218, it's easier. I won't screw that one up down the line.\nBut I think that we recognize that as we go down this path of a big, bold agenda that the President has, that we're going to need every vote we can, and hopefully grow the vote in some cases to well beyond that. But we're not writing off anybody, but we do recognize there are some lessons learned form this process, and the President made it very clear on Friday.\nThank you, guys, very much. I'll see you tomorrow. Enjoy the day.\nEND 2:38 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

In his remarks, he referred to White House Director of Strategic Communications Hope C. Hicks.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123646", "text": "The President. Good morning, everybody.\nParticipants. Good morning.\nThe President. Thank you very much. It's my pleasure to welcome such incredible women—including my daughter and Dina and Hope—[laughter]—and unbelievable entrepreneurs and small-business leaders to the White House. And also, Linda, thank you very much. You've been doing an amazing job; I hear working 24 hours a day is what the word is, huh? [Laughter] Good. I'm not surprised.\nSmall Business Administration Administrator Linda E. McMahon. Just trying to keep up with you. [Laughter]\nThe President. I'm not surprised. And I want to thank Linda for joining us today. She's doing a fantastic job leading the Small Business Administration, and she herself, as you know, is a great, great success story and a woman entrepreneur at the highest level. So thank you very much, Linda.\nEmpowering and promoting women in business is an absolute priority in the Trump administration because I know how crucial women are as job creators, role models, and leaders all throughout our communities.\nAs we conclude Women's History Month, I am thrilled that we can meet to discuss how we can continue this important mission. You all have incredible stories. Many of you started businesses from scratch, with very, very limited resources—sounds like I'm right about you, Lisa, right? [Laughter] But you had the grit and the determination to make your dreams become a reality, right?\nCeleebrate Us, Inc., Owner Lisa Phillips. Yes, yes. That's right.\nThe President. That's fantastic. Now you're providing hundreds of jobs across our country—and thousands of jobs. And you're really an inspiration to everybody—and that's men and women, believe me. A lot of men out there, they're not doing what you're able to do. [Laughter]\nToday, women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households with children under the age of 15. We're also—know that companies that promote women to senior leadership roles realize significantly better profits, according to statistics, than their competitors. I wouldn't have known that. Dina, how does that work? Tell me. [Laughter] That's pretty impressive.\nDeputy National Security Adviser for Strategy Dina H. Powell. It is very impressive.\nThe President. We must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive. We will continue to address the barriers faced by women professionals and entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and access to networks. We will make it very easy. It's going to be a lot easier. You're doing an amazing job. And for a while it was a very, very tough—almost impossible—job. My administration will also continue to advocate for policies that support working families, including making childcare more affordable and accessible. That's something that Ivanka Trump—and now Ivanka Trump Kushner—[laughter]—that you really have been working on and feel so strongly about—my daughter. I actually talked about it a lot during the campaign, and Ivanka was right up front. I also want to recognize Ivanka for helping to lead a national initiative to promote women business leaders and entrepreneurs. And the Chancellor of Germany is going to—has asked Ivanka to go to Germany, and she'll be working on similar issues with Chancellor Merkel. So that will be very exciting for you.\nIvanka M. Trump. Very much looking forward to it.\nThe President. That's going to happen very soon. It's a very great honor.\nI look forward to hearing your stories and discussing how we can work together to help all of your dreams come true and make it easier for those dreams to come true.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. And thank you, Mike, for being here.\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to thank all these business leaders for taking time for a conversation with a President who I think is going to be the best friend that small business in America will ever have. And I believe President Donald Trump is the best friend that women in business in this country will ever have. It is remarkable to think, here at the close of Women's History Month, of the impact that women-owned businesses have on our economy, Mr. President: more than 9.4 million firms, employing 8 million Americans, and annual revenues of $1.5 trillion.\nWomen business owners and women-owned enterprises are an enormous force in the American economy, and I know this President is committed to continuing to promote the kinds of policies that will make it possible for your firms to grow and for more women-led businesses to be born and to thrive all across America. The President is advancing an agenda of less regulation, less taxes, and investments in infrastructure, fair trade, and addressing health care costs to make health care affordable, not only for small-business owners, but for employees across the country.\nMr. President, I'm particularly pleased to be able to welcome a fellow Hoosier—[laughter]—to this conversation. Ms. Shirley Ann Perry, the owner of HydroTech is with us today, and she herself has a remarkable success story.\nBut, with that said, it's a privilege for me to be alongside the President today to listen in and to learn how we might better partner with each one of you and with women-owned businesses across the country to grow and thrive in this economy. And one of the great women business leaders in the country is helping the administration accomplish that, and so let me turn it over to Ivanka Trump.\nMs. Trump. Thank you, Vice President. And thank you all so much for being here. It's the perfect culmination of Women's History Month to have all of you around the table sharing with us both your successes and also the unique challenges that you face as women entrepreneurs and small-business owners.\nI feel very blessed to have met so many of you over the course of the past several months—Lisa in Baltimore; right here in DC, Claudia—and hear your personal stories and your journeys of how you became job creators. And you truly exemplify women's economic empowerment. So we're grateful to have you join us today. And maybe we'll launch right in. Claudia, if you want to start us off and tell us a little bit about your personal experience.\nAkorbi Chief Executive Officer and Cofounder Claudia P. Mirza. My personal experience. Thank you very much for taking the time to listen to us. It means a lot as small-business owners. Akorbi is a company with 930 employees. I started it from—[inaudible]—after I lost my job. We provide multilingual business communications around the world to empower global corporations to do business abroad.\nThe President. Great. And you've done a great job.\nMs. Mirza. Thank you.\nThe President. Good. That's—thank you very much. Lisa.\nTechnology Partners, Inc., Chief Executive Officer and Cofounder Lisa Nichols. Lisa Nichols, I'm the CEO, cofounder of Technology Partners. We're an information technology staffing and solutions company working across the Nation. We will celebrate our 23d birthday May the 4th. And just feel very, very blessed to be a part of this roundtable. Thank you so much for—I'm very thankful.\nThe President. Thank you very much. And I hear that Lisa Phillips has an amazing story to tell. [Laughter] Can you tell it in front of all these cameras? [Laughter]\nParticipant. You're famous here.\nThe President. I hear that you have one of the really amazing stories to tell.\nMs. Phillips. Wow.\nThe President. So do you want me to ask the press to leave? I will. [Laughter] Go ahead.\nMs. Phillips. I just hope I don't cry. So thank you, Ivanka, Dina, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. Thank you for this platform. I'm Lisa Phillips. I'm the owner of Celeebrate Us—gift baskets and parties. I celebrate families.\nI provide working families with very elaborate events that they otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. And my own personal story: I manage and help train homeless youth because I was once homeless myself. And I really, really, really was almost to the point of hopelessness. And so—but what a great country we live in. This is a country of chances. And I've been given chances, and so I employ people that need a chance. And so, in May, I'll be receiving my MBA, and you're all invited to my graduation.\nBut one of the things that is required for this country is hard work. And if you are willing to work hard, you'll get that chance. And so I'm a product of hard work, and so that's what this country was built on. And thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for giving us a seat at the table, because what we do is, we're going to take this back to people that couldn't be here and give them the information and empower them.\nThere's a dress owner at the store next to me, and I'm wearing one of his outfits. So I'm going to take pictures, and he's going to send these pictures back to India, to his family. And so that's how we help one another as business owners. We give someone else a platform. So thank you again.\nThe President. Thank you. Great job. You've done a fantastic job. Thank you, Lisa. Ms. Trump. One of the things that I was so amazed in your story—and everyone around this table—is not only the incredible job that you've done in building your businesses, but also the impact you're having within your communities in terms of the work you're doing to empower other men and women and children. So it's really remarkable.\nMs. Phillips. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Because the worst thing you can feel is hopeless. And so the youth that I train, the homeless women, women dealing with breast cancer, I'll do a workshop and empower them that, hey, that no matter where you are, that you can be elevated. Just look around, you're going to find someone that's willing to cheer you on. And so we just graduated a group of youth from our homeless unit in Baltimore—our homeless program—and now they're working at one of the local hospitals. And one of the hospital officials actually called me and said, can you send us some more? [Laughter] So—but kudos to those young people——\nThe President. That's great.\nMs. Phillips. ——that they really want to be able to elevate.\nThe President. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you very much. Amy?\nEntrepreneur Amy Pope-Wells. That's a great story. My name is Amy Pope-Wells, the owner of LINK Staffing, but I also own another company called Tire Diva. It's not too many females in the tire business, and it's a really tough place.\nThe President. Great name, actually. [Laughter]\nMs. Pope-Wells. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, coming here today, I was thinking about what I would say, and my businesses are my passion, but we would never have a place at this table if it wasn't for you. Opening up your new administration is doing so much, and I need you to know that we're taking that to our communities.\nOne of the things that happened for me was, part of my story is, I was a nurse by graduation, and I spent years. And that was the status quo in the community that I lived in, but something inside of me wanted to do more. And I'll never forget, my first job was an executive job, flying across the United States, going hospital to hospital, looking at the challenges and the problems, and I did that for 15 years, and it just felt like I was banging my head up against a wall, but I knew there was so much more opportunity.\nSo I went and started my own company. I said, you know what, I'll just be a boutique firm. But you can't keep that inside. So I started my business and grew it. Started partnering with companies like Walmart and Starbucks, and just working myself to the bone to service them. And everybody was, like, why are you doing that? And it's like, because it's the right thing to do. I'm giving hundreds of people jobs.\nAnd that led those relationships over to starting Tire Diva. But what I did was, I took that, and I started the Women's Empowerment Foundation 3 years ago, and I would bring—I bring 75 to 100, give or take, women that come, and I want them to have that inspiration. And sometimes, it's difficult. But being here at this table gives me the inspiration to keep going——\nThe President. Yes.\nMs. Pope-Wells. ——because I want to share that and make people feel empowered. It's—you always have to work hard, so there's no quick, easy way to do it. But if you can provide a guide, that's where it's at, you know? The President. Good job. Really.\nMs. Pope-Wells. Thank you, sir. Thank you.\nThe President. Really. Great enthusiasm. Good. Thank you.\nYes, Lili.\nCIEN+ Cofounder and Chief Executive Officer Liliana Gil Valletta. Yes, first of all, thank you so much, Ivanka.\nParticipants. Yes. Thank you.\nMs. Valletta. You've been a facilitator for us. I know that you, at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, have been instrumental in getting four of us Latinas around the table. So I'm proud to be one of them and bring forward the issues and challenges that we face. I'm an immigrant from Colombia, and I came to this country with a suitcase and a student visa and a pocket translator, without speaking a word of a English—at the word—at the age of 17.\nAnd then fast-forward, and after a successful corporate career—I was at Johnson & Johnson for 10 years—passion drove me to quit my corporate job, which was very comfortable. But what drove me was the shifting demographics of this country. If we are quickly becoming a majority minority nation, we have the advantage—economic advantage—of diversity. So what I do for a living with CIEN+ and CulturIntel, our big data analytics company, is helping the corporate leaders and Fortune 500 companies understand how to turn shifting demographics into money—[laughter]—into ROI, into growth.\nAnd that's why I'm here. I'm so delighted to share more about my journey as an immigrant. We are there, working hard, and the American Dream is real.\nParticipants. Yes!\nMs. Valletta. So thank you for the opportunity to share with you, with Mr. Vice President as well the Administrator. I can't wait to find solutions for us to work together positively forward.\nThe President. Thank you, Lili, very much. Thank you.\nYes.\nHydroTech Operations Manager and Owner Shirley Perry. Hi, I'm Shirley Perry. I'm from Anderson, Indiana. I'm in a very small environmental firm engaged in environmental cleanups and environmental consulting.\nI have seven employees, so I'm little. We started it 30 years ago, and I became sole owner in 2013. I'm a WBE. And we just do what we can for the environment. We clean up around gas stations, dry cleaners. We do testing of asbestos and mold. And it's just a good business to have, and it's a wonderful thing to be here. I'm excited.\nThe President. You've done a great job. Thank you very much.\nMs. Perry. Thank you.\nThe President. Linda, would you like to say something?\nAdministrator McMahon. Well, I'm just delighted to be here this morning. And I know what it's like for women who are often working in a male environment. Goodness knows, I can recognize that. [Laughter] But it's just great to hear all of the stories from all of you, and I'm really excited to be at SBA, because we do have our Women's Business Centers. We do have those centers to help guide, to help give advice, to help you do business plans. And we have them all over the country.\nSo we welcome you to come in, or for people you would like to send to our centers, we'd like to be helpful in any way we can—helping to provide more access to capital. And I think we were talking about, Amy, just sometimes you just need a little wind beneath your wings. So we're going to help provide hard information, but also a little wind beneath your wings.\nSo thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.\nThe President. Thank you, Linda. Great job.\nAdministrator McMahon. Thank you, Ivanka, Dina for setting this up. I'm really pleased to be here.\nThe President. Thank you. Thanks so very much.\nLa Cocina VA Founder and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Funegra. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Ivanka. That feels like a second date, right? [Laughter]\nMs. Trump. I feel very fortunate.\nMs. Funegra. We got together a little more than 10 days ago through the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and I'm proud to represent immigrants and Hispanics today. I'm also an immigrant. I moved from Peru 10 years ago to work in international development for a multilateral organization here. And I also quit my job and used my savings to start La Cocina VA, which is \"the kitchen.\" It's an organization that provides vocational and technical education and jobs to unemployed and underemployed immigrant women, in partnership with local governments, with higher education institutions, with private sector, and help this population to start businesses.\nSo when Lisa mentioned how important it is to make our dreams come true, I have a unique position: I help others make their dreams come true with vocational education, empowering women to believe in the possibility of success and open businesses. So the model that we are ready to replicate now in other cities and in other communities integrates governments, integrates private sector, and all the power and resources that that represents in order to really make impactful results in our communities. And we're—low-income communities. Thank you, President.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.\nSRD Legal Group Managing Partner Suzie Scanlon Rabinowitz. Hello.\nThe President. Hi.\nMs. Scanlon Rabinowitz. My name is Suzie Scanlon Rabinowitz. I am cofounder and managing director of an alternative legal model. We have a national network of more than 20,000 well-credentialed attorneys who are immediately available to support any legal department on a full-time or part-time engagement basis.\nAnd how we're making a difference is, the legal industry has historically really been challenged in working with women on a more flexible basis and also the diversity and inclusion issues. And so my businesses are helping to allow women who are returning to the profession after leaving to raise a family or take care of an aging parent come back and work on a more flexible basis.\nAnd also what we're doing is, we provide lawyers on an engagement basis to help Fortune 500 companies. And we're able to address some of the unconscious biases that exist by promoting women and minorities in roles that typically wouldn't go to women and minorities. And when our clients see how terrific our lawyers are, we give them permission to hire them directly. And it's really making an impact on promoting women and minorities at the highest level.\nThe President. Well, that's great. Great.\nMs. Scanlon Rabinowitz. Thank you.\nThe President. Where are you based?\nMs. Scanlon Rabinowitz. So we're a virtual platform, but based in New York and Connecticut.\nThe President. That's fantastic. Great job, thanks. Thanks, Suzie.\nMs. Scanlon Rabinowitz. Thank you.\nTrumbull Unmanned Chief Executive Officer and Founder Dyan Gibbens. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Dina, Ivanka, Administrator McMahon, it is an honor and pleasure to be here as part of this process.\nI am Dyan Gibbens; I lead Trumbell Unmanned. We're a Houston-based, a Forbes Top 25, veteran-founded company, and we provide critical data to the energy sector. And we fly drones in challenging and austere environments.\nNow, we primarily support oil and gas in environmental efforts, and we're all engineers, UV operators, and pilots. You know how you learn if someone is a pilot? They'll tell you. [Laughter] So they'll tell you that. A personal passion is promoting STEM for the next generation. And we've partnered with BP for drone camps at Rice University. We've partnered with Intel for a global STEM initiative. We hope to reach thousands—tens of thousands with that. We've also partnered with Microsoft for an online drone academy that we hope to reach millions of people.\nSo my goal today is to help change this meeting and create a movement. And it—thank you for your time.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you.\nOkay, folks, thank you. [Laughter]\nThe President. Oh, Jessica! Almost most important——\nJohnson Security Bureau, Inc., President Jessica Johnson-Cope. Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning, Mr. Vice President, Ivanka, Dina——\nThe President. Stay for Jessica. [Laughter]\nMs. Johnson-Cope. Yes, please—Administrator McMahon, my name is Jessica Johnson-Cope. I'm the president and CEO of Johnson Security Bureau. This week, Johnson Security will celebrate its 55th anniversary. We are a third-generation, family-owned and operated security services firm based in the South Bronx of New York City. The President. Good.\nMs. Johnson-Cope. And we provide security guard services, as well as armored car services to protect people, places, and valuable property across the New York metropolitan area.\nAnd I really relate to your story. I relate to your working closely with Ivanka and working side by side, because I took over my firm's—my family's business once my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. And we worked in the trenches until he passed away. And so I really respect what you two do together and hope to be able to continue our family legacy and to help other family-owned businesses as a result of our conversation today.\nThe President. Great job. Great job, Jessica.\nMs. Trump. Thank you so much, Jessica.\nThe President. Thank you.

And thank you, everybody, for being here. I want to welcome many State and local leaders; and we've had them all over the White House today, and it's a great honor—including Governor Eric Greitens of Missouri; Governor Gary Herbert of Utah; Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton of Kentucky—we're all at the White House, and we're all doing something very, very important today.\nI'm signing four bills under the Congressional Review Act. Before this administration, only one time in our history had a President signed a bill that used the CRA to cancel a Federal regulation. So we're doing a lot of them, and they deserve to be done.\nFirst, House Joint Resolution 37 rolls back the so-called blacklisting rule. When I met with manufacturers earlier this year—and they were having a hard time, believe me—they said this blacklisting rule was one of the greatest threats to growing American business and hiring more American workers. It was a disaster, they said. This rule made it too easy for trial lawyers to get rich by going after American companies and American workers who contract with the Federal Government, making it very difficult. Do you all know what I'm talking about, right?\nParticipants: Yes, sir. Absolutely.\nThe President. Does everybody agree? [Laughter]\nThe next three bills I'm signing cancel three Federal power grabs that centralize decisionmaking in Washington away from States and local governments, another big disaster.\nHouse Joint Resolution 44 removes a Bureau of Land Management rule that took control of land-use decisions away from States and local decisionmakers and gave it to Washington, and that's not good. That's never good. [Laughter] History has proven that's not good. Is that right?\nParticipant. Right.\nThe President. Even though you're from Washington, you know that. [Laughter] Even you will admit. Right?\nSenator Ronald H. Johnson. I'm from Wisconsin. [Laughter]\nRepresentative Virginia A. Foxx. No, we're not.\nThe President. Why not! You—that's right.\nRep. Foxx. We work in Washington.\nThe President. Definitely from Wisconsin, as opposed to—you have your choice.\nThe other two bills—House Joint Resolutions 57 and 58—eliminate harmful burdens on State and local taxes on school systems that could have cost States hundreds of millions of dollars. So it's the States and local tax—school systems, and that was very important. Parents, teachers, communities, and State leaders know the needs of their students better than anyone in Washington by far. So we're removing these additional layers of bureaucracy to encourage more freedom and innovation in our schools. I will keep working with Congress, with every agency, and most importantly, with the American people until we eliminate every unnecessary, harmful, and job-killing regulation that we can find. We have a lot more coming. It's going to be happening—[inaudible].\nThank you. Where are those bills? Bring out those bills. Put them right here. Perfect. Thank you.\nThis one you all know—joint resolution.\n[At this point, the President signed H.J. Res. 37.]\nThe President. Oh, that's going to save a lot of jobs. [Laughter]\nParticipant. There we go. [Applause]\nThe President. Who gets this pen?\nRep. Foxx. I do. [Laughter] Now, thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. That's okay. Thank you.\n[The President signed H.J. Res. 44.]\nThe President. Okay?\n[Representative Elizabeth L. Cheney spoke briefly to the President and took the pen from his hand, followed by laughter from the participants.]\n[Inaudible]—the other night. Your father looks—he's going to be around a long time, your father.\nRep. Cheney. I hope so.\nThe President. He's doing great.\nRep. Cheney. He is. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. He's doing great. He's a great guy. He endorsed me out of nowhere. I said that was a great endorsement. [Laughter]\nRep. Cheney. He has good judgment, Mr. President.\nThe President. I was very honored. Thanks, Liz.\n[The President signed H.J. Res. 57.]\nThe President. Okay? I'm going to give one to John back here because he's been so great, been my friend through thick and thin, right?\nSen. John A. Barrasso. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Even if it doesn't apply to you, I think I'm going to give you a pen. [Laughter]\n[The President signed H.J. Res. 58.]\nThe President. So I just want to thank everybody. It's an honor. This was a lot of work for a lot of people to get this done, but it's going to lead to a lot of good jobs and a lot less regulation. And it's going to be good for many, many, many people. So thank you all very much. Thank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2017-03-27", "title": "Remarks on Signing Legislation Under the Congressional Review Act"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123627", "text": "James S. Brady Briefing Room\n1:04 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: I know the pool is gathering at 1:30 p.m., so I'm going to try and keep this on the short end.\nThis morning, the President held a listening session with the Attorney General and the Fraternal Order of Police with the Vice President to discuss law enforcement issues related to terrorism and inner-city violence.\nThe Fraternal Order of Police is the world's largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, with more than 330,000 members. They represent those who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving. They advocate for improved working conditions for law enforcement officers and for the safety of our communities.\nThe President thanked the FOP leadership for their support and reaffirmed his pledge to have our back. The President also remarked that his highest duty is the security of our people and pointed to several actions that he's already taken to enhance our domestic security, including the creation of a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime; an Inter-Agency Task Force to Dismantle Criminal Cartels; and historic action to secure our borders and remove criminals from our country.\nThe group held an in-depth discussion about the rise of violent crime in some parts of the country, the disturbing increase in members of law enforcement being targeted in ambush style attacks, and the need to address the country's opioid epidemic.\nAttorney General Sessions told the FOP leadership that he looks forward to continuing to work closely with them to tackle the challenges facing law enforcement as they work to keep our communities safe.\nThis afternoon, as I mentioned at the top, the President will sign an executive order on energy independence at the Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters. The President strongly believes that protecting the environment and promoting our economy are not mutually exclusive goals. This executive order will help to ensure that we have clean air and clean water without sacrificing economic growth and job creation.\nFirst, it directs all agencies to conduct a review of all regulation, rules, policies, and guidance documents that put up roadblocks to domestic energy production and identify the ones that are not either mandated by law or actually contributing to the public good.\nIt also rescinds a number of the previous administration's actions that don't reflect this administration's priorities. The full list is laid out in the executive order, which will be provided to you later today, after the President signs it.\nNext, the order directs the EPA to take several actions to reflect this President's environmental and economic goals, including a review of the new performance standards for coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants that amounted to a de facto ban on new coal plant production in the United States.\nThis is great news for states like Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and others.\nFinally, the order establishes a directive for agencies to use the best available science and economics in their regulatory analysis moving forward.\nFor too long, the federal government has acted like a barrier to energy independence and innovation. By reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles, we'll free up American energy companies to responsibly use our vast energy resources, protecting the environment while creating well-paying jobs throughout the country.\nAmerican electricity producers have already done an amazing job of adapting and utilizing new technologies to deliver clean power to the United States. Under President Trump, the federal government is going to acknowledge that progress and adjust its policies accordingly.\nMoving on, later in the afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly. And this evening, the President and the First Lady will host a reception here in the White House for senators and their spouses. This will be the first time that President Trump has invited all current senators to the White House, and he looks forward to this opportunity, as well as to speak with some of the senators about the places where they can come together and make this country better.\nOne of those places that he hopes to find common ground with Senate Democrats here tonight is the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Yesterday, many Senate Democrats began declaring support for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's partisan filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch. And as I've said, these senators should get -- if these senators get their way, this would be the first successful filibuster of a nominee to join the Supreme Court.\nLeading Democrats have lamented these tactics as recently as last year. Senator Schumer, in fact, wrote last year in an op-ed in the New York Daily News -- and I quote -- \"At a time when Americans want to move forward, the last thing we need -- the last thing is a new recipe for gridlock at the Supreme Court.\"\nDemocrat nominee Hillary Clinton said of the Supreme Court confirmation progress -- \"[It] should not be an exercise in political brinkmanship and partisan posturing,\" and that nominees deserve a \"full and fair hearing followed by a vote.\"\nSenator Claire McCaskill of Missouri tweeted \"[T]he constitution says the Senate shall advise and consent. And that means having an up-or-down vote.\"\nSo who are Senate Democrats going to enact this on in extraordinary lengths to block? It's an individual, frankly, who their body, including Senator Schumer, unanimously confirmed for a seat on the 10th Circuit not too long ago. This is a judge who received a unanimous \"well qualified rating\" by the American Bar Association, was a Harvard Law graduate who received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service at the Department of Justice. So it can't be their qualifications they're taking issue with.\nJudge Gorsuch is, frankly, a mainstream judge. Here are some figures and facts to point that out. Number one, in 98 percent of the cases in which he issued the opinion, he received the unanimous support of all of his colleagues. Second, in divided cases over the last five years involving both Republican and Democrat-appointed judges, Judge Gorsuch sided with the Democrat-appointed judge one in three times.\nWhen the shoe was on the other foot, when a Supreme Court nominee for a Democratic President went through the confirmation hearings and meetings with senators from both parties, neither Justices Kagan nor Sotomayor faced an attempted Senate filibuster. Both received Republican votes in support of their confirmations.\nIn fact, during the Kagan nomination, on the Senate floor, when Senate Leader Harry Reid planned to file a cloture motion to bring Kagan to a vote, it was then-Senator and now current Attorney General Jeff Sessions who stopped him and said, \"I have a high standard before I would attempt to block an up or down vote,\" and asked Senator Reid to proceed with a vote without the need for overcoming a Republican filibuster.\nJudge Gorsuch has met with most of the Senate Democratic caucus. He has gone through days of hearings and answered probing questions. He is eminently qualified and deserves the deference and consideration from the minority Senate Democrats that President Obama's selections were given once they had gone through the confirmation process.\nA few things I want to highlight. Last night, the President announced his intent to nominate Makan Delrahim to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Anti-Trust Divisio) at the Department of Justice.\nAnd this morning, we announced the President's declaration that a major disaster exists in the State of Nevada and ordered federal assistance to supplement recovery effort in the areas affected by severe storms, flooding, and mudslides this past February.\nAnd finally, this morning, the President was pleased to see that Ford announced $1.2 billion investment in three manufacturing facilities in Michigan, just two weeks after automobile executives came to the White House and met with the President. This adds to the growing wave of positive news -- jobs news under the President and continued the investment from Charter Communications, and his approval for the Keystone XL pipeline on Friday.\nIn addition, Energy Transfer Partners reported Monday that the Dakota Access pipeline has been filled with oil as they enter the final stages of preparation that will finally put this into service.\nAccording to data released by the Conference Board, in March consumer confidence \"soared\" to its highest level in 16 years. And from individual announcements to significant boosts in both consumer and CEO confidence generally, it's clear that the President's economic agenda is what America's businesses have been waiting for. These businesses have spent years being held back by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape, and what we're seeing now is just the taste of the heights our economy can reach once those burdens are removed.\nAnd lastly, I want to make a comment on a false report regarding former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. As a matter of fact, I'd like to walk you through the sequence of events just to make sure that everyone is abundantly clear on what happened.\nOn March 14th, Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff invited Sally Yates to testify on March 28th. On March 23rd, Sally Yates's attorney sent a letter to the Department of Justice asking for their consent to testify without constraints.\nOn March 24th, the Department of Justice responded the President owns those privileges to discuss the communications they were requesting to talk about and referred them to the White House.\nAlso on the 24th, Ms. Yates's attorney sent a letter to the White House Counsel requesting that consent, specifically stating that if they did not receive a response by March 27th at 10:00 a.m., they would \"conclude that the White House does not assert executive privilege over these matters.\" The White House did not respond and took no action that prevented Ms. Yates from testifying.\nThat's the story. That's what the documents show.\nAnd with that, I'm glad to take some questions.\nQ: Can I follow on that, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Of course you can, John Roberts.\nQ: I'd like to follow on that. There are reports that even though the hearing that was set for the 27th was not scheduled, it was cancelled by Devin Nunes to prevent this White House from publicly invoking a claim of executive privilege. Could you speak to that?\nMR. SPICER: I hope she testifies. I look forward to it.\nIt was never -- let's be honest, the hearing was never -- we actually never notified. If they choose to move forward, great. We have no problem with her testifying. Plain and simple. The report in The Washington Post is 100 percent false. The letters that they, frankly, publish on their website all back up everything I just read. All of the letters are available on their website -- I hate to give them the traffic -- but the reality is, is that they specifically say, if you don't respond, we're going to go ahead. We didn't respond. We encouraged them to go ahead.\nBut to suggest in any way, shape, or form that we stood in the way of that is 100 percent false.\nBrian.\nQ: A couple of things you said earlier, a couple of quick follow-ups. You said you want the agencies to use best available science. Does that meant there's going to be no further scientific research, you don't want to fund additional scientific research? And number two: What other issues do you like to see the President reach out to Democrats?\nMR. SPICER: So on the first one, best science is best science. And that's whatever --\nQ: Best available is what you said.\nMR. SPICER: Right. Well, if it's not available, it's tough to use it. Just as a matter of practicality.\nQ: Well, but is that a code for not using --\nMR. SPICER: No, it's a code for it's got to be available. That's it, plain and simple. You shouldn't read anything into that. And I think the President will speak more to that at today's signing at 1:30 p.m. -- at 2:00 p.m., rather, I'm sorry.\nQ: And are Democrats --\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a whole host of issues. I talked yesterday about healthcare. If they want to come together on infrastructure, tax reform, we'd love to have as much support as possible.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. A couple questions. One on coal. Your actions today, the White House is saying that they're going to reverse President Obama's so-called \"war on coal.\" But a lot of people in the coal industry suggest that jobs are just not going to come back in that industry, based on the way the industry has changed, technology and other things. Does this administration have an estimate of how many jobs will be created as a result of the actions it's taking today?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of one, an estimate. I know that the President has already met with some of the coal miners the other day, and Senators Manchin and Capito, in particular, from West Virginia, and others from Kentucky that were here when we did that EO signing a few days ago. I will tell you that from a mining perspective, the miners and the owners are very, very bullish on this.\nSo the people who are actually in the business applaud this effort, believe that it will do a lot to revive the industry. It's obviously a private industry so I'm not going to get into who does what. But I know that the industry itself said so.\nSteve.\nQ: On the court announcement, you just said that the announcement today comes two weeks after the automakers met here at the White House. Did the White House or the President do anything in that meeting that led to this announcement today?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's been some regulatory effort and some commitments on the regulatory efforts going forward in the future that I think may have played a role. I would ask Ford on that. I think it's a continued sign of it. I think we have seen a number of industry leaders, union leaders, truckers, truck companies come in, talk about burdens. And I think there's been several cases where meetings in the White House -- or, frankly, we went to Michigan and held that roundtable out there as well -- that meetings that we have have a very positive follow-up in terms of a commitment from a company or an industry to create jobs, to invest more in this country. But in each of these cases --\nQ: Is the White House, then, going to get political credit for this announcement today?\nMR. SPICER: I'll leave it up to Ford to make that determination. I think that we're obviously pleased with more Americans getting jobs throughout various sectors. And I think that we'll continue, and the President has made it very clear that he continues to fight to bring back jobs and manufacturing here in the country.\nSteve.\nQ: Sean, as you begin looking seriously at tax reform, could you just go through what is the President's bottom line? Does it need to have middle-class tax relief, corporate tax relief? Can you do it comprehensively, or piecemeal? Do you add infrastructure spending to it somehow? How are you looking at this?\nMR. SPICER: So, on the first two, those are both key components -- the middle-class individual tax piece of it and then the corporate rate has to come down. I think those are guiding principles that the President has laid out.\nAs far as how the process works, there are -- and I don't want to get ahead of the folks in the legislative affairs or the guys on Capitol Hill, but I would suggest to you that there's a prevailing attitude out there that the FY18 reconciliation is probably the most likely vehicle to move some of this.\nAgain, what we want to do is keep a lot of options on the table in terms of do we put infrastructure in, is there another vehicle to drive that. But part of gathering folks together now from Capitol Hill, from industry, from groups, is to begin that discussion, to talk about what needs to go in, what the way forward is. And so that conversation has begun and is continuing.\nQ: And when do you think you'll have some recommendations to take to the President?\nMR. SPICER: Well, internally, the team has been talking to him for a while. I think there's a bigger discussion that has to happen as we branch out with outside groups, industry, members of Capitol Hill, et cetera, that start to formulate some additional listening that needs to happen on this. And again, I think part of it is there's a legislative strategy that needs to tie into this.\nBlake.\nQ: Is the White House currently involved in any renegotiations of the healthcare bill? And if so, in what manner?\nMR. SPICER: Staff has met with individuals and listened to them. So I don't know how detailed you want it. Have we had some discussions and listened to ideas? Yes. Are we actively planning an immediate strategy? Not at this time. I think there is a discussion that began, as I mentioned yesterday, of a lot of individuals on both sides of the aisle reaching out to both the President and key staff members to share ideas and additional ways forward. So there has been a discussion, and I believe there will be several more.\nQ: What would you say to the folks who have a genuine concern that if you could not get healthcare done, how do you go about getting big-ticket items like tax reform and infrastructure done? People say if you can't get one, how are you going to do the next? What would you say to that concern?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think -- I mean, we're going to build a coalition for this. I think each of them have different constituencies. And I think we're going to work with members on both sides of the aisle on both of those big-ticket issues to see where we can find agreement and move forward. But I don't want to prejudge the outcome at this point.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Just as a follow-up question on Blake's. Did the President himself have any discussions with Speaker Ryan or Leader McCarthy or anyone over the weekend about healthcare and making an actual vote on the American Health Care Act? And one got the impression from Speaker Ryan today that he was going to try to pass this with Republican votes, which would contradict some of your statements about reaching out to Democrats all along. Has any of this come up with discussions between each side of Pennsylvania Avenue?\nMR. SPICER: So I think I talked yesterday -- they have spoken a few times about different strategies, different ideas, different policy aspects to the bill.\nQ: Over the weekend?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. At least on a number of -- at least two, maybe three times, they've spoken. And I know several of our staff members have also engaged in discussions, again, to talk about potential ways forward. So those conversations have occurred. I think that's what I mentioned to Blake and I mentioned some of it yesterday. And if we can find a way forward, well do it.\nBut, look, I don't think -- just so we're clear, John, to your question, I'm not saying we've picked a strategy and we're going to go with this group or that group. I think the President was -- several people reached out and expressed an interest. And the President's view is that he's willing to listen to them and hear what their ideas are.\nAnd I made a comment yesterday that was -- that just so we're clear, we have -- let's call it 205, 207, somewhere in there, votes, right? Maybe 210, depending on what it is. The point that I made yesterday is to get to 216, to get to 218, depending on the day of the week, there are certain things that people want that would take what I think the President views as a very good bill that weren't worth doing it because they would make the deal bad. And so the question is, can we add the additional votes in ways that enhance the bill or bring people over that have been previous skeptics? But there's a way in which people are saying, hey, if you bring me on board with these five provisions, then I'm on board -- in which either, A, take people off the bill, or don't make it as strong and make it a bad deal.\nAnd I think that's the balancing act that has to happen. One is, can you add additional folks on without pushing additional folks off. And two is that, what you have to add to the bill, does it make it stronger or does it not? Because I think there are suggestions by some out there that have said we're willing to come along with the bill, but in doing so it would make it a bad deal. And that's an important aspect, is how do you take whatever that number is that we have now and get it up to 216 to pass without making -- without losing people and/or making it a bad deal?\nQ: Sean, does it --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, Glenn, I've already --\nQ: -- done with Republican votes, not Democrats?\nMR. SPICER: However we get there, John.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Yesterday you weren't able to tell us very much about Congressman Nunes's visit to the White House or to the White House grounds to view classified information last week. A Democrat on the committee today said that the White House would have known that he was here. The same Democrat also said that it looked like a criminal cover-up to him. My question to you is, have you learned any more information since we had this conversation yesterday about how he would have even gotten in and how he would have gotten cleared? And do you think that Congressman Nunes should recuse himself from being in charge of the Russian investigation at this point?\nMR. SPICER: Well, number one, on the latter part of that, it's not up to me. He's a member of the House. He's appointed by the Speaker. That is entirely up to the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives. We're not going to start commenting on that kind of stuff.\nI do think that he is running an investigation which we asked for. And I think the thing that's important to note is there is somewhat of a double standard when it comes to classified information. When leaks are made illegally to the press, and you all report them, the coverage focuses almost entirely on the substance of the allegation and that are part of an illegal lead, not on the illegal nature of the disclosure, the identity of the leaks, or their agenda.\nBut when the information that is occurring now, which is two individuals who were properly cleared -- or three, or whoever he met with -- I don't know -- that they are sharing stuff that is entirely legal with the appropriate clearances -- and then there is an obsession on the process.\nAnd it's sort of -- it's a backwards way that when you all report on stuff with sources that are leaking -- illegally leaking classified information, that's appropriate and fine. No one questions that -- the substance and material. When two individuals, or however many are engaged in this process, have a discussion that is 100 percent legal and appropriate and cleared, suddenly the obsession becomes about the process and not the substance.\nAnd I think that it is somewhat reckless and -- how the conversation over classified information is discussed without -- while sort of attempting to press a false narrative that exists. So while it is completely appropriate to share classified information with individuals who are cleared, it is clearly not the case to do that when it is illegally leaked out. And I think that's sort of the irony of how this whole conversation has gone.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, a lot, Sean. Just following up on your statement in regards to The Washington Post story that you say is false. Did the White House Counsel Office ever consider invoking privilege as it relates to Sally Yates testifying before this congressional committee?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And why is that? You certainly would be in a position to invoke privilege. After all, these were privileged communications between the Acting Attorney General and the executive office of the President. That would fall into privilege.\nMR. SPICER: Because I know this will be a shocker, but, again, part of it is that I think that we've been very clear that when you actually get to the bottom of the facts, every single person who has been briefed on this, as I've said ad nauseam from this podium, that they have been very clear that there is no connection between the President or the staff here and anyone doing anything with Russia. And I think that the view here was, great, go share what you know.\nSo, no. And that's why The Washington Post should be ashamed of how it handled this story. It was 100 percent false. The letters that they actually publish back up exactly what we're saying, that she was asked about this information -- her attorney asked the DOJ. The DOJ said that she had to ask the White House. They made it very clear, if you don't do this, we are going to go forward. We had no objection to her going forward. That's it.\nQ: Just quickly following up on that, I have two questions on two different topics. So we're taking what you're saying as assurances that Chairman Nunes's decision to call of that hearing did not have anything to do with any pressure from with White House?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Okay. Thank you.\nOn a different topic, we're seeing more states -- Maine, Virginia, and Kansas, specifically -- moving to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, joining the 30-plus states that have already done that. What is President Trump's message to Republican legislators and legislators generally in those states now that the Affordable Care Act's future is so uncertain?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a reason he explained to Congress, and especially members who have talked about entitlement expansion, why we should have passed this bill last week and why we need to address it now. This is a major issue. It was one of our talking points, so I hope they listen.\nQ: Does he encourage the expansion?\nMR. SPICER: I think he understands that the way that it was handled in terms of the able-bodied provision under that right now are leading to an implosion on that piece of the entitlement, and that there was an opportunity to refocus it, and to push the money and a lot of the authority back to the states to best determine how to handle issues within their states -- both in terms of high-risk pools and individuals that they wanted to cover.\nSo we -- frankly, the bill made it a much more state's rights program and a much more state's rights decision-making process in terms of how to care for the populations that they had to address.\nCecilia.\nQ: Thank you. Just a couple things on the Yates thing. So how and when exactly did the White House encourage her to testify?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the letter that her attorney sent literally says that, if we do not receive a response by March 27th at 10:00 a.m., I will conclude that the White House does not assert executive privilege over the matters with respect to hearings or otherwise. I don't think you can be any clearer than that.\nQ: And so you're saying now executive privilege does not --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I'm not saying anything. I'm literally -- that's what she wrote. The action was, if you don't act, then we will assume the following. Great. I don't think that you can read that any other way. It was very -- she's a, I'm sure, a very talented -- he is a very talented lawyer, and wrote it specifically for it. We read it that way, and chose to not act because we have no problem with her testifying -- plain and simple.\nQ: So executive privilege is not an issue for Sally Yates -- would not have been an issue for Sally Yates testifying?\nMR. SPICER: That's correct.\nQ: Okay, thank you. And following one issue -- do you want to add?\nMR. SPICER: No, I just -- it's interesting, I mean, this is very clearly worded, and yet somehow you're asking me how to interpret that in any other way than literally reading plain English.\nQ: Okay. Interpret something else for me: Does the President still believe that climate change is a hoax?\nMR. SPICER: I think you will hear more today about the climate and what he believes. I think he understands -- he does not believe that -- as I mentioned at the outset, that there is a binary choice between job creation, economic growth, and caring about the environment. And that's what we should be focusing on. I think, at the end of the day, where we should be focusing on is making sure that all Americans have clean water, clean air, and that we do what we can to preserve and protect our environment.\nApril, go ahead.\nQ: All right, thank you. Sean -- don't seem so happy. Anyway, with all of these investigations, questions of what is is, how does this administration try to revamp its image? Two and a half months in, you've got this Yates story today, you've got other things going on, you've got Russia, you've got wiretapping, you've got --\nMR. SPICER: No, we don't have that.\nQ: There are investigations on Capitol Hill --\nMR. SPICER: No, no -- I get it. But you keep -- I've said it from the day that I got here until whatever that there is no connection. You've got Russia. If the President puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that's a Russian connection. But every single person --\nQ: It's beyond that. You're making it--\nMR. SPICER: Well, no -- I appreciate your agenda here, but the reality is --\nQ: It's not my agenda.\nMR. SPICER: No, hold on. At some point, report the facts. The facts are that every single person who has been briefed on this subject has come away with the same conclusion -- Republican, Democrat. So I'm sorry that that disgusts you. You're shaking your head. I appreciate it, but --\nQ: I'm shaking my head and I'm listening, and I'm trying to get --\nMR. SPICER: Okay, but understand this -- that at some point, the facts are what they are, and every single person who has been briefed on this situation with respect to the situation with Russia -- Republican, Democrat, Obama-appointee, career -- have all come to the same conclusion. At some point, April, you're going to have to take \"no\" for an answer, with respect to whether or not there was collusion.\nQ: But my question was how do you change the perception of --\nMR. SPICER: We're going to keep doing everything we're doing to make sure that the President -- that what the President told the American people he was going to do to fulfill those pledges and promises that he made, to bring back jobs, to grow the economy, to keep our nation safe -- that's what he's been focused on since day one. We're going to keep focusing on that every single day.\nQ: But when Condi Rice comes Friday. Condi Rice did not support this President. She did not go to the convention. She comes -- what is on the agenda, and how is their relationship? Has it healed since 2006 when he used a very negative word to describe her?\nMR. SPICER: So, here's what I'll -- hey, it's interesting that you ask those two questions back-to-back. On the one hand, you're saying what are we doing to improve our image, and then here he is, once again, meeting somebody that hasn't been a big supporter of his.\nQ: But he called her that negative name in 2006.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, but you put it -- April, hold on. It seems like you're hell-bent on trying to make sure that whatever image you want to tell about this White House stays, because at the end of the day --\nQ: I am just reporting what --\nMR. SPICER: Okay, but you know what? You're asking me a question, and I'm going to answer it, which is the President -- I'm sorry. Please stop shaking your head again. But at some point, the reality is that this President continues to reach out to individuals who've supported him, who didn't support him -- Republicans, Democrats -- to try to bring the country together and move forward on an agenda that's going to help every American.\nThat's it, plain and simple. So if you're asking what we're doing, I think we continue to do it, which is to bring groups together that have been supportive of him, that haven't been supportive of him, but that to share a goal, which is finding common ground on areas of national security, of personal security, of economic security, of job creation, of safer communities, of education, of healthcare that can unite us as a country and make the country stronger.\nQ: -- about Russia and Tillerson Friday?\nMR. SPICER: I think they're going to -- I'm not ready to\n-- when we're done with that, we'll see if we can have a readout.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, I understand that. We're not at Friday yet. I will have a readout when that's done.\nI know the pool needs to get to the vans for the signing. Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow. We're going to do five days in a row this week, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, guys.\nEND 1:32 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-28", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

Well, you're the greatest people. You keep us safe, right?\nFraternal Order of Police National President Kenneth C. \"Chuck\" Canterbury. Yes, sir.\nThe President. You keep us safe. It's a tremendous honor to welcome the Fraternal Order of Police to the White House. So many of you I know for so long, and you've been friends of mine, and you do a great job. Nobody braver.\nI want to thank your entire leadership team, including your national president, Chuck Canterbury. I also want to thank you for your support during the election. I guess you probably know, the numbers were extremely lopsided, right? I'm just trying to figure out who were the few people that voted the other way. Who are they? [Laughter] Can you find out who they are, please, and let us know?\nAs I traveled the country during my campaign, I had the great privilege to spend time with our amazing police officers, who risk their lives every day to keep us safe. And I made a crucial pledge: We will always support—and you people know that better than anybody, you know me—the incredible men and women of law enforcement. I will always have your back, 100 percent, like you've always had mine, and you showed that on November 8.\nI'm also pleased to have with us our great Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. Thank you, Jeff, for being here. That was a big day you had yesterday too, on sanctuary cities.\nAttorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III. Thank you.\nThe President. That was a very, very important thing you did and, frankly, a very popular thing. So congratulations.\nAnd Jeff is with us—a strong supporter of law enforcement—you know that. He was in Alabama. He was the attorney general. He was a U.S. attorney, and a lot of people don't know that. They know him as the Senator, but the law enforcement people knew him more even as the other. So going to do a great job. Good, Jeff. Great to have you with us.\nSadly, our police are often prevented from doing their jobs. When policing is reduced, the main victims are the most vulnerable citizens of our society, and you see that all over. In too many of our communities, violent crime is on the rise, and in too many places, our citizens have not been safe for a very, very long time.\nThese are the painful realities many in Washington do not want to talk about. They just don't want to hear about it. And we have seen that; we've seen it all over.\nBy the way, who is from the standpoint of New York? Where are my New York guys here? Huh?\nParticipant. No New York.\nThe President. That's terrible. [Laughter] I have one sitting in my office. He's the greatest. He's coming right in. Last year, in Chicago, 4,368 people were shot. Nearly 700 more have already been shot since January of this year alone. I ask, what's going on in Chicago, right? What is going on there? There's no excuse for it. There's no excuse for it. I'm sure you're asking the same question: What's going on in Chicago?\nI also want to thank our Vice President for being with us. Mike Pence has been amazing——\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. ——an amazing Vice President and very much a believer in law enforcement and the job you people do.\nAll of our citizens have the right to live in safety and peace. We will work every day to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminals from your communities, and we already are. They're being moved very quickly. In fact, General Kelly, as you know, has done a fantastic job on the border. Down 61 percent since Inauguration. People coming in down 61 percent, which is a tremendous number.\nMy highest duty as President is the security of our people, the security of our Nation. That is why I've already taken numerous actions to enhance domestic security, including the creation of Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime, an interagency Task Force to dismantle criminal cartels, along with historic actions to secure our borders and remove criminals from our country. We're removing MS-13. We're removing criminals all over the country. They're getting out. We're taking them out. And for that, I thank you folks. I know you're in strict coordination with General Kelly and the Border Patrol and ICE, and you've been doing a fantastic job.\nAs President, I will work night and day to make America safe again. And we've already done a big part of it. You'll see the numbers come out very soon. I just want to thank all of you for your leadership. I want to thank all of you for your expertise, the job you've done. And it's a great honor to be with you today.\nAnd we'll now go around and just introduce yourselves. You'll introduce yourself in front of all this live television. It's always live for me. You know, unfortunately, the other guys, they make a speech and nobody cares; with me, everything is live. One mistake, and it's no good. But we just can't make mistakes, right? So we don't make mistakes.\nGo ahead, Ken.\nMr. Canterbury.

And thank you to our great Vice President, Mike Pence.\nI'm thrilled that everybody could be here with us today. I want to give special thanks to Administrator Scott Pruitt, Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Secretary Rick Perry for your remarks. I told Rick, I said, run it the way you ran Texas—[laughter]—because this is going to be a great operation. And he did a great job, and we're honored to have all three. And I'm really honored to have our Vice President, because Mike Pence has been outstanding. Hasn't he been outstanding?\nTogether, this group is going to do a truly great job for our country. We have a very, very impressive group here to celebrate the start of a new era in American energy and production and job creation. The action I'm taking today will eliminate Federal overreach, restore economic freedom, and allow our companies and our workers to thrive, compete, and succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time, fellas. It's been a long time. I'm not just talking about 8 years; we're talking about a lot longer than 8 years. You people know it maybe better than anybody.\nThanks, as well, to the many distinguished Members of Congress who have taken the time to be here. I want to thank all of our industry leaders who are with us and who share our determination to create jobs in America, for Americans. And, Shelley, thank you very much also. I spotted you in the audience. Thank you.\nThat is what this is all about: bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams, and making America wealthy again.\nI also want to thank the dedicated public servants who are with us this afternoon. You're doing important work to protect our health and public resources. So important.\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the truly amazing people behind me on this stage: our incredible coal miners. We love our coal miners. Thank you, guys. Great people. Over the past 2 years, I've spent time with the miners all over America. They told me about the struggles they've endured. I actually, in one case, I went to a group of miners in West Virginia—you remember, Shelley—and I said: \"How about this? Why don't we get together, we'll go to another place, and you'll get another job; you won't mine anymore. Do you like that idea?\" They said: \"No, we don't like that idea. We love to mine; that's what we want to do.\" I said, \"If that's what you want to do, that's what you're going to do.\"\nAnd I was very impressed. They love the job. That's what their job is. I fully understand that. I grew up in a real estate family, and until this recent little excursion into the world of politics—[laughter]—I could never understand why anybody would not want to be in the world of real estate. [Laughter] Believe me. So I understand it. And we're with you a hundred percent, and that's what you're going to do. Okay?\nThe miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods. They told me about the efforts to shut down their mines, their communities, and their very way of life. I made them this promise: We will put our miners back to work. We've already eliminated a devastating anticoal regulation, but that was just the beginning. Today I'm taking bold action to follow through on that promise. My administration is putting an end to the war on coal. Going to have clean coal, really clean coal. With today's executive action, I am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse Government intrusion, and to cancel job-killing regulations. And by the way, regulations not only in this industry, but in every industry. We're doing them by the thousands, every industry. And we're going to have safety, we're going to have clean water, we're going to have clear air, but so many are unnecessary, and so many are job killing. We're getting rid of the bad ones.\nOne after another, we're keeping our promises and putting power back into the hands of the people. First, today's energy independence action calls for an immediate reevaluation of the so-called Clean Power Plan. Perhaps no single regulation threatens our miners, energy workers, and companies more than this crushing attack on American industry. Second, we are lifting the ban on Federal leasing for coal production. Third, we are lifting job-killing restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas, clean coal, and shale energy. And finally, we are returning power to the States, where that power belongs. States and local communities know what is best for them. They understand it. They get it. They've been doing it for a long time. It was taken away from them and not handled well. And they are the ones that we should now—and will now—empower to decide.\nMy action today is the latest in a series of steps to create American jobs and to grow American wealth. We're ending the theft of American prosperity and rebuilding our beloved country. We approved the permit to finally build the Keystone XL Pipeline and cleared the way to completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline—thousands and thousands of jobs.\nWe've already created a half a million new jobs in the first two jobs reports of my administration. And if you noticed today, Ford—great company—announced massive new spending on three big plants in the State of Michigan, a State which I love very much. Do you remember what happened in Michigan? [Laughter] Remember, November 8. Oh, that was an exciting Michigan evening. [Laughter] And Ford just made that announcement. That's a great announcement. It's a very important announcement. It means jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe are going to continue to expand energy production, and we will also create more jobs in infrastructure, trucking, and manufacturing. This will allow the EPA to focus on its primary mission of protecting our air and protecting our water. Together, we are going to start a new energy revolution, one that celebrates American production on American soil.\nWe want to make our goods here instead of shipping them in from other countries. All over the world, they ship in, ship in—take the Americans' money, take the money, go home; take our jobs, take our companies. No longer, folks. No longer. We believe in those really magnificent words: Made in the U.S.A. Right, fellas?\nWe will unlock job-producing natural gas, oil, and shale energy. We will produce American coal to power American industry. We will transport American energy through American pipelines, made with American steel. Made with American steel. Can you believe somebody would actually say that?\nThis came up a little bit coincidentally when I was signing the pipeline deals. I'm all signing, I've got them done. And I said, folks, where do we get the steel? And they said, I think it's from foreign lands. I said, no good. Who makes it? Who makes those beautiful pipes for the pipeline? Sir, they're made outside of this country. I said, no more, no more. So we added a little clause—didn't take much—that you want to build pipelines in this country, you're going to buy your steel, and you're going to have it fabricated here. Makes sense, right? Doesn't it make sense, Bob? Think so. He knows. Together, we will create millions of good American jobs—also, so many energy jobs—and really lead to unbelievable prosperity all throughout our country. And Rick Perry is going to have a lot to do with that.\nI want to just thank everybody in this room. You're all very special people. In particular, I want to thank the miners. You know, my guys, they'll get enough thanks. These people haven't had enough thanks. They've had a hard time for a long time.\n[At this point, the President greeted and shook hands with a group of coal miners who were on the stage.]\nThey're tough-looking guys too. I'll tell you what—not going to mess around with this group, right?\nAll right. Thank you, fellas. I made my promise, and I keep my promise.\nSo I want to thank everybody in the room. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nCome on, fellas. Basically, you know what this says? You know what it says, right? You're going back to work. That's what it says.\nParticipant. That's good.\nThe President. You're going back to work.\nReady?\nParticipants. We're ready.\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order and distributed some pens as gifts.]\nThe President. Okay. Come on. How about a miner? One of the miners. Who's the miner back there? Only a miner. [Laughter] Come on, fellas. You split it up. Cut it up—[laughter]. Come on, where's Ryan? Where's Ryan? Okay, Rick, you'll split that up with Ryan.\nI want to thank everybody very much. This is a great honor today. Very special, special people. And you're going to see a lot of progress. And Shelley, thank you very much. We—you have been fantastic. Really fantastic. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Policy. (a) It is in the national interest to promote clean and safe development of our Nation's vast energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth, and prevent job creation. Moreover, the prudent development of these natural resources is essential to ensuring the Nation's geopolitical security.\n(b) It is further in the national interest to ensure that the Nation's electricity is affordable, reliable, safe, secure, and clean, and that it can be produced from coal, natural gas, nuclear material, flowing water, and other domestic sources, including renewable sources.\n(c) Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that executive departments and agencies (agencies) immediately review existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources and appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law.\n(d) It further is the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law, all agencies should take appropriate actions to promote clean air and clean water for the American people, while also respecting the proper roles of the Congress and the States concerning these matters in our constitutional republic.\n(e) It is also the policy of the United States that necessary and appropriate environmental regulations comply with the law, are of greater benefit than cost, when permissible, achieve environmental improvements for the American people, and are developed through transparent processes that employ the best available peer-reviewed science and economics.\nSec. 2. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Safe, Efficient Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources, with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy resources.

Thanks so very much. You may be seated. Well, on behalf of the First Family, it is a great, great privilege for Karen and I to welcome you to the White House for what I know will be a very special evening tonight. And as the President of the Senate, it's particularly meaningful for me to welcome Republican and Democrat Members of the Senate to this very special evening.\nI want to give special appreciation to Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer. Thank you so much for both being here tonight. Thank you for your service to the Nation. And also, the President pro tem of the Senate, Orrin Hatch—I think the longest serving member of the United States Senate—is with us. And lastly, a rousing round of applause for the spouses that are with us tonight that make the sacrifices so that the Members who are here can serve. I know the First Family is particularly moved that so many family members could be here this evening. So I thank you all for making time to be with us.\nAnd this will be an inspiring night, and hopefully, it will be an encouraging night. I know the President and the First Lady and Karen and I are well familiar with the sacrifices of public life. And tonight is just, from the First Family to each one of you, a small token of their appreciation for your service to your State and your service to the people of the United States of America.\nSo, with that said, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce our host and hostess for this evening—the President of the United States of America and Mrs. Melania Trump.\nThe President. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Nobody ever told me that politics was going to be so much fun. [Laughter] But we're doing well. It's doing very well.\nWe just had a call—long call—from General Mattis. And, John, I know, is very happy to hear that, but he knows better than anybody, we're doing very well in Iraq. Our soldiers are fighting and fighting like never before, and the results are very, very good. So I just wanted to let everyone know.\nI have some very special friends of—in this room, especially—I must tell you, we have the Republicans, but I even have a couple of Democrats. I said—we had a dinner here about 3 weeks ago, and it was so beautiful. We have these incredible musicians from the Marine Corps and from the Army—incredible, actually. And I said, you know, I'd like to do something special: I'd like to ask the United States Senate, with spouses, to come and hear how good it was. It was just a beautiful evening.\nAnd so here we are. And shockingly, it's semi-bipartisan. A lot of people showed up that people weren't expecting, which is a very good thing. [Applause] Which is a very, very good thing.\nAnd I know that we're all going to make a deal on health care; that's such an easy one. [Laughter] So I have no doubt that that's going to happen very quickly. I think it will, actually. I think it's going to happen, because we've all been promising—Democrat, Republican—we've all been promising that to the American people. So I think a lot of good things are going to happen there. We're going to talk about infrastructure. We're going to talk about fixing up our military, which we really need. There has been a depletion, and we're going to make it so good and so strong. And there's, I think, never been a time where we needed it so much.\nAnd we're going to be doing a great job. And hopefully it will start being bipartisan, because everybody really wants the same thing. We want greatness for this country that we love. So I think we're going to have some very good relationships.\nRight, Chuck? I see Chuck. Hello, Chuck. [Laughter]\nAnd I really think that will happen.\nSo again, enjoy these incredible musicians. They are really something special. And I hope we're going to do this many, many times together as a unit. Thank you all for being here.\nMelania, thank you very much. Our Vice President—did we make the right decision with Pence? Right? Huh? And, Karen, thank you very much. So nice. Thank you.\nThank you, everybody.

On behalf of the President of the United States of America today it is my great privilege and honor to administer the oath of office to the 20th United States Ambassador Israel, David Friedman. (Applause.)\nWe're joined today by his beautiful family, beginning with his wife, Tammy; their five children. (Applause.) And five of their beautiful and highly animated grandchildren. (Laughter.)\nIt is really an honor to have with us David's counterpart, as well, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Ron Dermer. Mr. Ambassador. (Applause.)\nThank you all for being here at this historic occasion. It's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President of the United States of America is a lifelong friend of Israel and the Jewish people, and under his leadership, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this: America stands with Israel. (Applause.)\nOne of the clearest signs of the President's commitment to the State of Israel and to its people is in his choice of David Friedman as America's Ambassador to Israel.\nDavid, you literally were born for this job. It is because of families like yours that the Jewish people are such a beautiful thread in the fabric of this nation.\nYour father, Morris, was a rabbi in New York, and as the Book of Proverbs teaches, he and your mother trained you up in the way you should go.\nAnd so you have. They raised you with the same faith as your forefathers, and instilled in you a love for America and for Israel from your very earliest days.\nAnd that love has been evident throughout your life. In over 35 years as a successful lawyer, you have always made it a priority to support Israel's peace, security, and prosperity. And you've worked tirelessly to deepen the friendship between our two nations.\nOver the years, you have literally traveled to Israel more 75 times. You have been a leader in humanitarian philanthropy to help the people of Israel in their time of need. You've always been quick to rise to Israel's defense from those who would condemn her -- because in your heart you know that those that hate Israel hate Israel not for what she does wrong, but for what she does right.\nDavid, your record of compassion and care for Israel and her people is an inspiration to the President and an inspiration to us all. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has now called on you to represent our nation as the ambassador to our most cherished ally. And this is a critical time for our two nations and our peoples. The challenges we face are many, but our resolve to overcome them has never been stronger.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, the United States will always be a faithful friend to the Jewish State of Israel. And David, the President and I both know that you will help us make the immutable bond between our people and the people of Israel even stronger still.\nSo, on behalf of President Trump, it's now my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.) (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your kind words and your extraordinary leadership. You have been a beacon of moral clarity in a world that increasingly needs such a beacon more and more. Thank you so much.\nMy thanks to President Trump for his courageous leadership, his friendship, and his guidance. I am humbled by the trust he has placed in me, and I will do everything that I can to justify his faith and confidence in my abilities.\nI'm very proud to say that my nomination represents the first time in American history that the U.S. ambassador to Israel was nominated by the President as early as the first day of his presidency. I was nominated on January 20th on Inauguration Day.\nI'm equally proud to say that this is the first time in American history that the U.S. ambassador to Israel was the first ambassador approved by the Senate and given the oath of office. Those facts speak volumes about how highly the Trump-Pence administration prioritizes our unbreakable bond with the State of Israel.\nI've also been deeply inspired by the leadership of Secretary Tillerson, and I look forward to working with him to promote peace and stability within the Middle East.\nA few days ago I left a legal practice that was a great source of professional pride and accomplishment. My deepest gratitude to the partners of what was once called Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman. (Laughter.) And especially to Marc Kasowitz for his deep friendship and understanding.\nI have a few close friends who are here whose friendship I deeply value -- none more so than Eric Hirschman (ph), who has guided my transition from the private sector to public life. Thank you, Eric.\nMy children and most of my grandchildren are here. They are everything to me -- seeing the pride in their eyes inspires me to take on this new task with great energy and enthusiasm.\nMy wife and I have four parents. Our fathers are no longer of this world, and my mother is not well enough to travel. And so I welcome today Bunny Sand, my mother-in-law, as the representative of our beloved parents. And I know that her pride is felt by those who are no longer with us. (Applause.)\nFinally, my undying love and devotion to my beautiful wife, Tammy. As I said at the confirmation hearing without her, none of this would have even been thinkable, let alone possible.\nThank you all very much.

And thank you, KT, for your great leadership on the airwaves and in this administration. We're so grateful to you.

(Applause.)\nAnd it's great to be here during Women's History Month, isn't it?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes, it is.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: The world has celebrated International Women's Day on March 8th since 1911. It was in 1980 that President Jimmy Carter declared the week of March 8th National Women's History Week; and six years later, the National Women's History Project successfully petitioned Congress to expand National Women's History Week into the entire month of March. And today, here in the East Room at the White House, we're continuing a celebration of Women's History Month by really bringing together an extraordinary group of women who are serving this administration with incredible distinction. (Applause.)\nWe welcome you all to this Women's Empowerment Panel. This event is really the tail end of a month that culminates in a series of activities where President Trump has sought to honor women's contributions to the United States of America.\nHe's held multiple listening sessions dedicated to finding solutions to the unique challenges that women face in the workplace and in running businesses.\nHe's signed legislation promoting education and employment for women in the sciences -- in areas that we've been historically under-represented.\nAnd he signed a proclamation declaring that women's \"contributions to our Nation's life, culture, history, economy, and families have shaped us and helped fulfill America's promise.\"\nThe truth of this statement is evident for all to see. This may be Women's History Month, but the fact is that women in America make history every single day. (Applause.)\nToday I'm really looking forward to just sitting in. You're going to hear today from some of the extraordinary women that President Trump has brought in to help lead this administration -- Betsy DeVos, from one of the great, storied business families in Michigan and America. (Applause.) Now the Administrator of the Small Business Administration [sic]. Betsy has already been on the road talking about how we get America moving again for women entrepreneurs.\nAnd of course, one of my two daughters' favorites, she was a governor, now she is the United States Ambassador to the United Nations -- Nikki Haley is with us today. (Applause.) As you can imagine my two daughters -- one in college, who is headed to law school next year, and one who just started her career -- are not very impressed with people in politics. (Laughter.) But both of them said to me, a few years ago when Nikki passed through a challenging time in the life of her state, they said, that Nikki Haley is really cool. And we are so honored to have you in this administration. (Applause.)\nAnd the new Administrator for the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services -- and a Hoosier -- Seema Verma is with us today. (Applause.) This is an extraordinary group of women, and I'm looking forward to hearing their thoughts today.\nAnd it really is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThis is a President who has advanced the interests of women and relied on women leaders at crucial moments throughout his career -- like when he named a woman to lead his campaign for President, and Kellyanne Conway became the first woman in American history to lead a successful presidential campaign. (Applause.)\nThe truth is, American women are making a difference in our administration, in our economy, and in our communities every single day.\nThey're driving our economy through entrepreneurship and innovation. In fact, there are more than 9.4 million women-owned American businesses that employ nearly 8 million Americans with annual revenues now totaling $1.5 trillion.\nAmerican women no doubt inspired by the leaders like those gathered in this room today are also graduating from college and post-secondary education in record numbers.\nAnd women leaders are defending our nation and wearing the uniform of the United States of America. (Applause.) I'm proud to say my wife, Karen, has actually spent this month at the direction of Mrs. Trump highlighting the service of women in our armed forces and the spouses that support men in our armed forces.\nAnd American women are leading our country from the halls of government, and you're about to hear from some of the most noteworthy.\nIn the midst of busy lives, American women are also doing those most precious things -- they're making time for families, for communities, and for involvement in religious organizations.\nPresident Trump and our administration I promise you are going to work tirelessly to empower women to be able to climb the ladder of opportunity and contribute even more to America's success in the years ahead.\nAnd I know, under President Trump's leadership, the future for our country and the future for American women is brighter than ever before. (Applause.)\nOne of those great leaders I'm going to invite to the podium -- another great American leader in public life will be our moderator today.

SPICER: Good morning, everyone -- or it's technically afternoon, I guess. Sorry to move it up and screw up the schedule a little, but we've got a couple of events this afternoon so I've got to get through this, get some questions and then got to move on. But we've got two more on-camera briefings the rest of the week.\nThis morning, the President just wrapped up -- or is continuing to -- I know some of the pool just left -- but the President is currently hosting an opioid and drug-abuse listening session with senior administration officials, governors, experts in the psychology of drug addiction, recovery-awareness advocates, and others who have been affected by the opioid crisis.\nDrug abuse has crippled communities across this nation. In 2015, more than 52,000 Americans -- that's 144 people a day -- died from a drug overdose, with 63 percent involving an opioid, according to the CDC. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in our country. As the President discussed with the group this morning, we won't be able to address this academic -- excuse me -- epidemic with a single solution.\nFirst, we must get struggling Americans the help that they need. Too many families have seen firsthand the destruction that drug abuse can bring, and we must also focus prevention on law and enforcement. Cheap heroin is flooding into our communities as drug cartels expand into the country, setting off a chain reaction of addiction that spreads from person to person and from family to family.\nPresident Trump has already taken executive action to strengthen law enforcement and dismantle criminal cartels. He and his team will continue to discuss how best to root out this threat to American communities with drug enforcement experts as we continue this fight. Stopping this epidemic is not -- is an issue that every American, regardless of your political background, can and must get behind. We must work together from the leaders of the most -- from most local and community recovery and support programs all the way to the White House to solve this problem.\nThe White House took a big first step this morning in our battle to combat drug addiction and the opioid crisis by meeting with these individuals, which included New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie, who has been a leader on this issue. Attorney General Sessions, Education Secretary DeVos, Veterans Administration Secretary Shulkin, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, and others were in attendance. A full list of participants has been provided.\nI will say -- I know the pool was just in there -- it is -- some of the stories from some of the individuals who have been involved in this with a family member are unbelievably compelling. Their desire to see and to work with the administration to get this problem addressed is one that is plaguing communities, and I know the President places it at the highest priority.\nThere was a mention by the drug -- the Acting Administrator of the DEA that they have a program where, twice a year, they gather unwanted drugs. Last year they gathered over a million pounds of unwanted drugs. There's 5,000 sites in which people across America can drop off stuff in their medicine cabinet that is no longer used to get it out of their house. The next drop-off will be on April 29th, and I think the DEA will be putting out more information. But when you see some of the action that was taking place in this report, it is truly a call to arms for a crisis that is plaguing our country.\nThis afternoon the President will drop by the Women's Empowerment Panel that the White House is hosting, led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Small Business Administrator McMahon, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma, who will all speak about the unique challenges that women and young girls face today. Vice President Pence and the First Lady will also be in attendance.\nThe President is proud that his administration is full of so many female leaders from who will be on stage this afternoon to those incredibly -- their incredible work doesn't always make headlines, but it's certainly felt across the federal government and across our nation. Women's History Month is coming to an end, but the Trump administration is committed to empowering women in the workplace. The work that we started this month will not end at the end of this month but will continue.\nThe President made women's empowerment a priority throughout the campaign, speaking out on affordable childcare and paid family leave, investing in women's health, and the barriers faced by female entrepreneurs and business owners. In February, he and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada launched the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs. This month the First Lady hosted an event for International Women's Day in the East Wing. CMS Administrator Verma hosted a panel on women in healthcare. His daughter, Ivanka, held a roundtable with women business owners with SBA Administrator McMahon, as well as other -- roundtable with Latina business owners.\nAnd just earlier today, the First Lady joined the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, to present the 2017 Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award at the State Department.\nThe President believes, as the First Lady said this morning, \"Wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them. However, wherever women are empowered, towns, villages, schools and economies are empowered, and together, we are all made stronger.\" The Trump administration will continue to work to ensure that the American economy is a place where women can work and thrive.\nLater this evening, the Vice President will participate in the swearing-in of David Friedman, as the next ambassador to Israel. The President is glad that Ambassador Friedman will be officially on board as we strive for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Mr. Friedman's strong relationships in Israel will be a tremendous asset to the President in furthering that mission.\nFinally, I want to speak about Judge Gorsuch and the blatantly political obstruction of his nomination to the Supreme Court by Senate Democrats. Yesterday, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that next Friday the Senate will vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. We welcome this news. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have begun justifying their opposition to Judge Gorsuch by claiming a 60-vote standard for his confirmation. That standard doesn't exist and these claims continue to be false. A party-line filibuster by the Senate minority is not a fair up or down vote.\nYou don't have to look further than the voices of many of these same Democrats to see why, in 2013, Senator Tom Udall said, and I quote in full, \"Some of us may disagree with Justice Scalia on judicial philosophy, but he was a qualified nominee. He received an up or down vote and he was unanimously confirmed. Likewise,\" he said, \"Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was considered a liberal. The former ACLU general counsel, many on the other side may have disagreed with her views but there was no filibuster. She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3.\" He added, \"A minority in the Senate should not be able to block qualified nominees.\" We could not agree more with Senator Udall.\nUnfortunately, he has now adopted a new party line of obstruction in blocking a fair up or down vote on the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. It's both sad and unfortunate. And we encourage all senators from both parties to fairly evaluate the judge's eminent qualifications and grant him an up or down vote.\nWith that, be glad to take your questions.\nApril.\nQ: Why thank you, Sean. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: How are you today?\nQ: I'm fine. And how are you?\nMR. SPICER: Fantastic. (Laughter.)\nQ: Great. Well, Sean, going back to some issues that are in the news -- Nunes is not going to recuse himself. In the midst of all of this back-and-forth, what does the White House say about that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, April, the White House -- I think I mentioned this yesterday. He's conducting an investigation. He is the elected or appointed -- I can't remember how they do over there, but appointed and confirmed -- or however they -- but by his colleagues in the House and the Speaker. He is the chairman, he's conducting an investigation. It is up to the House of Representatives and the Speaker and the members of the House Republican Conference to determine. There is nothing that I see that is problematic in him conducting an investigation that we asked both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\nQ: What are the conversations the President is having with Paul Ryan about this -- to include Dems and Republicans are talking about what looks like impropriety in the intel chief's handling of this so far, particularly as there's not a hearing right now?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I would take issue with -- I think you're right that there may appear to be certain things, but I don't think there's any actual proof or sustaining allegation about anything that's done. Again -- I mentioned this yesterday -- if you look at what Chairman Nunes has done, he has met with people who are cleared to discuss classified information regarding a review that he is conducting. That's how it's supposed to work.\nAnd again, I understand that when things are leaked out in the media that somehow that is a standard that's acceptable, but when two people who are cleared to discuss classified information, or three, or however many, discuss classified information, somehow that's wrong because it's not being leaked. He is conducting a review, which we have supported, on both sides of the chambers. And I think that they should do this.\nBut I think to start to prejudge where this thing is going -- we have been in support of, as you know -- and I think that let's let that process bear itself out and see what happens.\nI will tell you that I've seen reports in the media that the NSA has documents that they are supposedly trying to get to the House Intelligence Committee that have been requested. We think that's a great thing if that's, in fact, what's happening. But again, I think part of this all gets back to that there's a process. And I get that sometimes it's frustrating to us. I believe that we want this over as much as I think some of you. But we recognize that there's a process that has to take place, and that process is taking place. The Chairman and the House Intelligence, and I know that Senator Burr and Senator Warner are talking about the process that they're going to go on on the Senate side.\nSome of these things take a little bit of time. And to the extent that they are gathering the appropriate documents and looking at those things, then that's part of the process and the review that is being undertaken, and we're fine with that.\nQ: And second topic. Tax reform and infrastructure -- reports are saying you're going to do it together. And ACA -- well, Obamacare, going into Trumpcare, at that time, tax reform and infrastructure were said to be some of the reasons why you did not come up in the budget with eliminating the debt. Do you have cost estimates as it relates to tax reform and infrastructure as of yet.\nMR. SPICER: No, because I think you need to have plans laid out first. And I think part of this is that we're in the beginning phases of both of those. So to have a score on either one of them or a cost when we don't have those formalized yet -- and I think we're in the beginning phases of having those discussions with both stakeholders, members of Congress on both sides, and obviously internally the formulation of those plans is continuing. So until that happens, I don't see us having a formal cost or a score.\nQ: Do you trust CBO now?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of trust. Remember, I want to be clear about what I've said before -- I think when it comes to cost estimates and budget issues, which is what CBO is charged to do, they're the Congressional Budget Office -- and while I think sometimes they're a little off on that, that is what they're charged with doing. And I think there's a score.\nWhere I think -- it's not a question of trust, it's a question of accuracy. And I think that the issue that we previously brought up was when they had scored people and coverage, which isn't necessarily their wheelhouse, they have been way off. And again, I don't think it's a question of us trusting or not. It's literally a question of saying, they believe that 26 million people would be on Obamacare; 10.4 were, and falling.\nI think that's -- that's not a question of whether we trust them or not. It's a question of -- those are the facts, and those facts bear out that they were off by more than 50 percent when it came to counting people. And I just want to be clear that it's not a question of whether we trust them or not. I would ask whether that's really what they're supposed to be doing.\nMajor.\nQ: Sean, a couple of things that we talked about on Monday. On Monday you said to us from the podium you would look into how Chairman Nunes was cleared to be here and with whom he met. Can you give us -- we tried to ask you that yesterday as you walked out. Do you have any information to live up to the commitment you made here on Monday to provide more details about how that happened in a process you just told us yet again is above board and totally appropriate?\nMR. SPICER: I don't have anything for you on that at this time. But again, I don't --\nQ: Have you looked into it?\nMR. SPICER: I have asked some preliminary questions. I have not gotten answers yet. And I think there's -- so, no, I don't have anything further on that.\nBut, again, I would argue, Major -- it's interesting -- and I brought this up the other day -- that there seems to be this fascination with the process. It's: How did he get here? What door did he enter? As opposed to what's the substance of what we're finding. When I get -- not from you, and I'm not trying to be -- but so many times I get these calls that we have an unnamed intel source that says the following substance occurred, do you admit it, do you deny it, whatever -- and we have this argument over substance.\nIn this case, the fascination is with what door did he come in, who did he meet with, how did he get WAVEd in, as opposed to what I think it should be, and, ironically, it's not when it's\n-- when the shoe is on the other foot, is what's the substance. Just yesterday, just to be clear, we started this day with The Washington Post falsely posting a story saying the White House blocked Sally Yates. By the end of the day, it's \"officials blocked Sally Yates.\" They were wrong. And they jumped to a conclusion based on whatever unnamed sources.\nAnd I think that what we're trying to do is argue that there should be a process. The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and others are going through a review. We support that review. And so, as much as I understand that everyone wants to jump to how did everyone get in, what did they do -- they're undergoing an investigation.\nQ: I have a substantive question about that.\nMR. SPICER: Okay.\nQ: But I'm just asking you about something you told us --\nMR. SPICER: No, I said I would look into it.\nQ: Are you going to continue to look into this?\nMR. SPICER: I will, I will look into it and whether or not --\nQ: You'll live up to that obligation to look into it?\nMR. SPICER: I will. But the obligation is I said I would look into it, and I continue to do that.\nQ: Okay. So you said yesterday about Sally Yates \"show what you know.\" Well, one of the reasons that there's this question about Chairman Nunes is he hasn't told his own committee members what he knows, how he learned about it, and what the substantive importance of that is. So we are also curious about that. And among the things that might shed light on that is how he got here and who he met with and what he learned.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: We're trying to figure that out as well.\nMR. SPICER: I understand, and I think those are questions for him.\nQ: Don't you want to know those things?\nMR. SPICER: But I think that, Major, that there's a slippery slope that we're talking about here, because if we start looking into certain things, then the accusation the next day is going to be, you looked into this, can you look into that; why did you ask this person. I mean, a couple weeks ago, there were stories about whether or not we called certain people and we did -- so we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't on this stuff -- because on the one hand, you want certain answers; on the other hand, you want to talk about us being involved. And I think we've tried to keep -- we asked for an investigation, and at the same time, we've tried to make sure that we allow that review to go on that -- both the House and the Senate Intelligence.\nSo we can't cherry-pick every time that you decide that a piece of information is relevant to what you want. I think that we know that they are undertaking a review -- hold on.\nQ: -- is going on, and the members of the very committee themselves say they don't know what is being discussed.\nMR. SPICER: Fair enough. Right.\nQ: How is the process going forward? How is that a workable process?\nMR. SPICER: But what I'm saying is, the answer to that question is, that is a question for Chairman Nunes. I don't have any authority over how the House Intelligence Committee conducts itself. That's a question --\nQ: You have authority about whether he gets into this building and can review secured information on this site.\nMR. SPICER: But how he conducts himself with his members, when and where he shares things, et cetera, are issues for him and the committee and the House of Representatives, not for us. That's it, plain and simple.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, we know that members of the House Freedom Caucus the Tuesday Group, Republican study group are up on the Hill trying to see if they can come to some sort of an agreement to find a way forward on healthcare. How real does the White House think this possibility of resurrecting healthcare is?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President, from the early days of his campaign, talked about repealing and replacing it. It's a commitment that he made. I think he'd like to get it done. But he also understands -- and I don't want to be -- I'm going to be completely consistent with two things. One is, he understands that in order to get to 216, we have to make sure that it does what he says it was going to do -- that it achieves those goals of lowering cost and creating more options. And so we're not going create a deal for the sake of creating a deal that ends up being not in the best interest of the American people. You got to know when to walk away from a deal that is going to end up bad. And he wants to have a good deal.\nAnd so the deal that he's looking for is willing to have members come and talk to him, and engage on this whole area and figure out what it would take, what their ideas are to get there, to grow that vote. And if they can do that and get to an area where we will have a majority of the House and can move it to the Senate, then we're going to engage in that. What we've seen members of both sides of the aisle engage with the White House on ways that are potentially -- ways to get there. And so it's a conversation, and we're not trying to jam that down anyone's throat right now. It's an ongoing discussion.\nQ: Does the White House share the frustration of many Republicans in Capitol Hill and the sentiments that the House Freedom Caucus \"botched\" this?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's comments on this speak for themselves.\nQ: I just have one more, and on the same thing. The President and members of the White House have suggested that maybe we can get some Democrats onboard on healthcare reform. The fact that no Democrat, not one Democrat supported the last attempt, and given the desires of the Freedom Caucus versus what the Democrats were doing, it is reasonable to think that even one Democrat would come onboard this?\nMR. SPICER: No. I mean, I think it is not unreasonable to --\nQ: No, I said, is it reasonable.\nMR. SPICER: I think it depends on how they want to get there. Again, there's a balancing act. It's not about just picking up one; it's picking up enough to get to 216. And it's, what does that take without compromising the principles that you want to achieve. So is it possible -- sure -- that there's a handful or so, or maybe more Democrats that are willing to engage. But it's worth the conversation. But again --\nQ: Isn't this kind of a Boehner tactic, to say, okay, if you're not going to work with us, House Freedom Caucus, we're going to go to the Democrats?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's a tactic to get to -- I mean, it's a math tactic. It's how do you get to 216, in this case. And it's engage with whoever will get you to that number.\nNow, as I mentioned yesterday, I mean, over the course of 17 months, Obamacare failed and started multiple times; it went off on multiple different tracks, including single payer, until it finally came back, and ultimately, upon Scott Brown's election, they jammed it through and did it so quick to make sure that the Secretary of Human Services -- but I get it. And so we're 20 days, 21 days into this process, 22 probably today. So we'll see.\nBut I think the idea that the President has put out there is that if people want to float ideas and suggestions on how we can grow this vote and get to a majority, he'll entertain them.\nTamara.\nQ: Thank you. I have sort of a lightning round about opioids. Is a commission being created? Is Chris Christie the head of that commission? He was sort of talking about it, but I haven't seen anything on it. And what sort of timeline will that commission have in terms of presenting findings? What's the goal of this thing?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's -- I mean, I think it's easier to start with the goal. I think if you see the roundtable -- and I know the pool will have a readout of this afterwards -- the goal is to figure out -- I think Governor Christie has been a leader of this in New Jersey. It's an issue that plagues countless communities more and more. And so whether it's New Hampshire or other places in the Midwest, it's sitting there and figuring out best practices and how can we get it down, and how can we provide the treatment.\nI mean, I think the DEA Administrator was noting in the discussion that we've gotten really good at law enforcement. But the question is, how do we focus on the treatment, how do we focus on the prevention, how do we look at things that happened in the past to deter drug addiction from starting in the first place, and to deter young people in particular from starting with drugs, to now, how do we help families cope with this? There's a lot of it.\nSo I think today is the first step of bringing some of these stakeholders together. But like I just mentioned on the other thing, I appreciate that everyone wants the answers, but I think that there's a reason that you're looking at this as two things -- a whole of government and a whole of person, right? It's looking at, how do we look at people to help them get the recovery, stay clean, not start in the first place, help them get into treatment centers, help them get a job afterwards. I mean, there's a lot of whole of person, but then there's a whole of government.\nAs I mentioned, I mean, you're looking at -- around that table today you've got families and parents and individuals who have been personally affected in one way, shape, or form. You've got Governor Christie who's dealt with it at a state level. You got Pam Bondi who's looked at it from a state level. You've got Secretary Kelly who's looking at it from Homeland Security; DEA, who's looking at partially from law enforcement. Then you've also got Secretary DeVos, who's looking at it from education and prevention. And it is a big, big issue that is plaguing our country, plaguing our communities, and plaguing our families.\nAnd so I wish I could give you an answer and say this is how we're going to solve the problem. But I think the first step is understanding the problem, the magnitude of it, and looking at how we approach it holistically.\nQ: Two very short ones. The timeline for them coming back with findings. And then, the President, when he was campaigning, seemed to endorse the STOP Act, which would prevent fentanyl from being imported -- help to prevent fentanyl from being imported from countries like China. Would he use his presidential bully pulpit to sort of push for that legislation now, which has not really gotten off the ground yet over in the conference?\nMR. SPICER: That was one of the -- not the specific piece of legislation, not the STOP Act in particular, but I think there was a lot of discussion about fentanyl and the rise of it today. And I think the Attorney General brought that up and was talking about the escalation of that from the 1980s to now. And so there is a look at it.\nBut again, as I mentioned, you've got the Attorney General there, law enforcement, education. Part of this is to really look at this and figure out what are the ways that we can address it from coming into the country. And the DEA Administrator was talking about it, especially the flow from the southern border. But then you look at it from a law enforcement issue, a prevention issue and a treatment issue.\nAnd this is a -- I wish I could give you a really easy answer and say here is the silver bullet that's going to stop this. But we recognize the growth of this problem and this epidemic, and how do we solve it going forward.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Yesterday, Prime Minister Theresa May signed the letter that began the process for Brexit. A week ago, on Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is the President of the European Commission, used some unusually strong language about the President, saying that his comments encouraging other Brexits could lead to war among the Balkan countries. And he also said in the end, and is quoted on page one of The Financial Times, that the President does not know a lot about Europe. Was is the President's response to that?\nMR. SPICER: To Brexit, in particular? Or to --\nQ: To the comments by President Juncker of the European Commission on Brexit?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President is very well steeped in world affairs, especially Europe, NATO, all of the issues. He was a leader in the effort to call Brexit, as you know. And obviously, with respect to that, we respect the will of the British electorate and Her Majesty's government in taking steps of departing the European Union. Whatever future the UK-EU relationship looks like, we want the UK to remain a strong leader in Europe, for both the EU and Europe to remain strong leaders globally.\nI think both on the EU and on that, that's -- Ronica.\nQ: Sean, thank you. I have two questions, or topics. But just the first: What's the White House reaction to the shooting today at the Capitol?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it sounds like a very troubled individual. Obviously, I'll let law enforcement read that out, but I don't want to get ahead of -- from what I understand, and what I have seen, it sounds like a very troubling instance. I think -- again, I don't want to get ahead of this, but it looks like law enforcement -- I appreciate the efforts that the Capitol Police and others took. I mean, you literally watched people put their lives in harm's way today to protect tourists and other citizens. And so I want to commend the work of the Capitol Police and the work of law enforcement to continue to protect us.\nAt this time, when Washington is in its glory, with the cherry blossoms out, and so many people are coming here to visit the Tidal Basin and the House of Representatives and the Senate, and walk around Washington, D.C., it's reassuring to know that so many brave men and women are willing to put their lives on the line to make sure that the city stays safe.\nQ: A second topic -- last weekend, the President spent the weekend here, not in Mar-a-Lago. I'm wondering, was that in any way in response to some of the pushback he's received about the cost associated with those trips. And part two of that -- does he plan to be here again this weekend?\nMR. SPICER: So, no. Yes. (Laughter.) He will -- the President wanted to be here last weekend. He wants to be here this weekend. He'll be here, and then I will have updates on where he'll be going forward.\nQ: Does he feel any concern about that pushback?\nMR. SPICER: No, he feels great.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. President Trump is reportedly expected to sign legislation that would allow Internet service providers to monitor Internet activity and sell that information without users' permission. Will he be signing that legislation? And why does think it's good for America? I'm wondering who this benefits apart from ISPs and their executives.\nMR. SPICER: The House and the Senate have just passed that. When they enroll it, then we'll have further updates on that. I'm not -- when we have -- I know that -- I believe we a statement of administration policy on that bill out, and when we have further updates on a signing ceremony, I will let you know.\nQ: Doesn't this erosion of protections create major risks for people to use that information for nefarious purposes? Also hostile nations potentially looking at what congressmen are browsing online -- is that concerning to the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's -- as I mentioned, that we have a statement of administration policy on that bill, that we will have further updates, and when we do -- we sign, I'm sure we'll have further details on why.\nZeke.\nQ: I've got two questions on two topics for you. The commander of CENTCOM was up on the Hill earlier today and testified that the U.S. government believes that Russia has been supplying material (inaudible.) I was wondering if the White House has any response to that testimony, and does it believe that that's a constructive effort.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, who was testifying?\nQ: The commander of CENTCOM. Is that a constructive effort on the part of the Russian government in that region?\nMR. SPICER: I know there is several entities looking into this, and I'm not going to -- I will say that DOD's response speaks for itself. We understand the intelligence on this. The President has been briefed on it. So I'm not really sure what specifically you're --\nQ: -- on the action of the Russians right now.\nMR. SPICER: I think the commander -- the CENTCOM commander's testimony speaks for itself on that.\nQ: And a second topic for you: About a month from now, the government will run out of money without another CR, as I'm sure you're aware. The President talked a lot about it in the campaign, and in his budget request funding for a border wall on the southern border with Mexico. Is that a deal-breaker for the President in any sort of government funding measure in the next month or so?\nMR. SPICER: So on April 29th, the CR expires -- the continuing resolution -- and we are going to be working with Congress on that -- on the FY17 budget that needs to go forward. I know Director Mulvaney has talked about that. I'm not going to get into the specific details. I know that, if you saw the budget they put out, I think it's $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion that he's initially put in the FY17 for the beginning of that wall, and there's $2.5, $2.6 --\nQ: $1.6 billion is in there --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that is our request, and we will continue to work with Congress on how to move forward with the rest of fiscal year 17's budget.\nBlake.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. A couple on healthcare. The President here, last night, speaking to senators, said -- quoting here -- \"I know that we're all going to make a deal on healthcare -- that's such an easy one… I have no doubt that that's going to happen very quickly.\" What is the renewed sense of optimism, and what exactly is \"very quickly\"?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a little bit of sound that needs to go with that. I think he was having a little bit of fun with some previous comments that were made with respect to how easy it would be to get healthcare.\nSo -- but there is a renewed sense because I think the comments and the calls that the President has gotten, as well as the Vice President and other members of the senior team that have come in and said, we believe that there is a path forward, we have some ideas, and we'd like to talk to you about that. I know I've seen some of the reports that have been put out regarding some of the individual members of the Senate and the House that have been up here meeting with our team, and I think there is a lot of people who have some ideas about how to move forward, and we're entertaining those.\nBut I think the interesting thing is, is that despite the setback that we got last Friday, I think there is a renewed willingness from a lot of members who made commitments to the American people and to their voters that they want to see this done, and they understand that not getting this done means that -- as I said, and the President echoed when he went up to the House Republican Conference -- is there's going to be a consequence for this. People need to be taken at their word. There's a lot of members that made a commitment to their voters, to their constituents that they were going to get something done on this and repeal and replace and address the healthcare situation, and that hasn't gotten done. And I think that's a concern for them.\nQ: And let me ask you real quickly -- you say that you embrace the House Intelligence Committee review of all of this. John McCain said earlier today that because of the potential schism within that committee, that there should be a select committee that goes from this. Would you embrace that if that happens, and what would your response --\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- again, and I'm not going to get into House and Senate matters, but I don't -- as I mentioned at the outset to April, I believe that people -- look, all that is -- how they conduct themselves internally is up to them. That's obviously not for us to decide. But I think the question that I still think is outstanding is that what has happened is a review was called for that -- part of it was already ongoing, from I understand, especially on the House side. And the chairman of that committee has gone and sought information and individuals who believed that information to further the review. I'm really not sure how that's anything other than what you're supposed to do, and I think that is consistent what he has talked about.\nDave Boyer.\nQ: Sean, thanks. Two questions. You mentioned Senator Udall opposing the Gorsuch nomination. He was here at the party last night. Did the President try to work with the room, with him and other Democrats, about the nomination last night?\nMR. SPICER: I know he and the First Lady and others spoke to a variety of senators. I'm not -- I wasn't keeping tabs on everybody that he spoke to, but I do know that he had an opportunity to speak to a lot of different senators, and he's talked to a lot on the phone. So I don't know about Senator Udall himself.\nQ: And secondly, two-thirds of the Democratic senators did not attend the party last night. Did that disappoint the President?\nMR. SPICER: I think we were excited to see the one-third that did. I know Senator Schumer was there, Senator Durbin. There were a lot of folks. And again, I think that -- I'm sure the President will continue to do things like this. It was an amazing opportunity to have a moment sort of free of politics and to enjoy some collegial moments with each other in the White House, and listen to the United States and Marine Corps bands play some amazing music and bring people together.\nAnd I think the President has talked about this. You know, he's mentioned this a bunch of times that there used to be a time when you could sit down and share a meal together, go -- and I think that's what he's been trying to do, is bring groups back in, and at least just have a conversation and get to that human side a little bit. And so yesterday was a good start, I think.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sean, the President's got in his inbox a letter from Senate Democrats, and they say -- the Democrats say they are ready and willing to work with the President on improving Obamacare, they just have a couple of conditions. First, the President has to abandon his effort to completely repeal the law and rescind the executive order. This letter is signed by the vast majority of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate. What does the President say?\nMR. SPICER: I think, as the President has noted, we're willing to engage with people. I think they understand his principles. We need to repeal the law and replace it with something better. I understand what --\nQ: But they're saying they want to take full repeal off the table.\nMR. SPICER: I understand what they -- I've seen parts of the letter and I know that 40 of them -- saw that. And I think what we need to do is figure out who wants to engage in a constructive conversation. I understand what they want, but again, it's not just a one-way street. I think the President has made very clear what he wants to do. And I think to the extent that some of them want to have a conversation, we have a 52-seat majority in the Senate. If there are individuals in there that want to have a constructive conversation achieving the goals, we can do it. But I think they also need to understand the President's red lines.\nQ: But they say, as a first step, they want him to repeal that executive order. Is that something he is willing to do?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President is committed to making sure that he continues to go down the path that he's gone down, and there are ways that, if they want to join him, that they can. And I think there are some areas that they may want to engage with him on that we've seen so far.\nAnd so, look, I understand they have a right to put out a letter and draw their lines in the sand. But I think the President is committed to doing -- going down the path he is. And obviously first step is to get to 216 in the House, and then address the concerns in the Senate. But he has continued to have conversations with the Senate, and I think that, as Obamacare continues to struggle -- which it is -- the premiums continue to go up and up -- I think the question is will those 40 people understand that they are the ones who are going to be responsible for owning the current policies that are making so many Americans struggle?\nJim.\nQ: But just to clarify, was he joking when he said that making a deal on healthcare would be an easy one?\nMR. SPICER: I think if you watch the tape, it was a light-hearted moment, Jonathan. And so he was having a little --\nQ: He doesn't think it's easy to --\nMR. SPICER: No, he was -- no. Watch -- he was having a fun time with the senators there.\nJim.\nQ: The other thing that the President said last night was our soldiers are fighting like never before in Iraq. But as you know, Sean, U.S. troops there are in a support role -- an advise-and-assist role. What does he mean? What does the President mean when he says they're fighting there like never before? Obviously --\nMR. SPICER: I think --\nQ: -- that doesn't take into consideration what happened during the Bush administration and the Obama administration --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, I appreciate --\nQ: -- fighting house to house.\nMR. SPICER: Yes, I think that there has been some progress, particularly in Mosul, the way that they have taken back that city. And I think that for a long time there was a lot of concern about Iran moving in and dominating parts of Iraq. And I think with the advice and consent of U.S. military advisors, there's been tremendous progress in moving Iraq forward to an area of civility and to continuing to see the troops there in Iraq stand on their own.\nAnd I think that he is very pleased with the action that General Mattis and our soldiers and sailors, airmen, and Marines are taking to do that.\nQ: I was going to follow up. If you couple that comment with the comment on healthcare, it being the easy one to get that done, it just -- it sounds like -- probably have heard this and come across this notion that he's just detached from reality in making those comments.\nMR. SPICER: First of all, I think that -- I again would respectfully ask you that you review the tape. He was having a light-hearted moment. It's on tape. Everybody watched it. He was poking fun and making a joke. There's been comments before about how he didn't get it, and he was joking about how easy it was, okay? It was a light-hearted moment. It was on tape. I think everybody -- and the idea that there's this -- like you're trying to make it look like he was being utterly serious at the time is a little bit of a stretch.\nQ: And one quick thing on Chairman Nunes.\nMR. SPICER: But I think -- just so we're clear, I'm sorry, just to end there -- that he was very proud of the work that our soldiers and sailors are doing over there in Iraq. There is a lot of work and a lot of progress that is being made in the updates that he's getting from General Mattis on a daily basis.\nQ: But he doesn't think they're in combat, they're engaged in combat?\nMR. SPICER: No, no. But, again, I think the progress that's being made in Iraq and that the fight against is going extremely well -- and he's proud of it.\nQ: And I was just going to ask you very quickly on Chairman Nunes. Do you personally know who the source of Chairman Nunes's information is?\nMR. SPICER: No, I do not.\nJeff Mason.\nQ: Sean, one on both -- on two topics. First on healthcare. Does the President want to start a new healthcare bill or tweak the one that did not go last week?\nMR. SPICER: I think we're starting with where we are and trying to move that forward. I think that is the current vessel.\nQ: And on a separate topic. The President did not mention the Paris agreement yesterday when he went to the EPA. Can you update us on his current thinking about that? Does he want the United States to stay in? And if he does, how does he expect the United States to meet its commitments without the Clean Power Plan?\nMR. SPICER: I think the Paris agreement is still under discussion within the administration.\nQ: Do you have a deadline on when you'll know?\nMR. SPICER: I can try to look into that. I don't have one at this time.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Early voting has begun in the Georgia Sixth Congressional District special election to fill the seat of Secretary Price. Some Democrats are billing this is a referendum on the President, the early days of the presidency. What does the White House think of that? And does President Trump plan to be involved at all in this race?\nMR. SPICER: That's a good -- honestly, I've not even thought about it. I think that if needed, the President has always been very clear that he wants to support the team and help the team. Honestly I've not tried to really focus on -- (laughter) -- tried to shed that previous life a little. So I've not looked into Georgia -- the race in Georgia. I'm sure I'd best refer you to either the RNC or the NRCC on the state of that race.\nThank you, guys, very much. I'll see you tomorrow, Thursday. Take care.\nEND 12:47 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:32 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to White House Senior Adviser Jared C. Kushner; Alvaro D. and Jane E. Vitolo, parents of Ms. Vitolo; Brian \"Bird\" McEnroe, community director and family liaison, A Sober Way Home; and New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Lee A. Solomon, father of Mr. Solomon. Mr. Solomon referred to his mother, New Jersey Board of Utilities Commissioner Dianne Solomon. Ms. Garozzo referred to New Jersey Board of Education Commissioner Kimberly Harrington; and Pam Kolletzki, girlfriend, and Olivia and Felicia Castellanos, and Cathleen Kemp, sisters, of her son Carlos Castellanos, who died from a heroin overdose on December 23, 2016.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123641", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. Thank you for being here with us this morning. During my campaign, I promised to take action to keep drugs from pouring into our country. And I want to just thank Secretary Kelly; he's done an amazing job. Down 61 percent at the border right now in terms of people, and the drugs that are being stopped. It will take longer, and there's great cooperation with Mexico and others. But we're doing a good job.\nAnd we want to help those who have become so badly addicted. Drug abuse has become a crippling problem throughout the United States. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in our country. And opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since 1999. This is a total epidemic, and I think it's probably almost untalked-about compared to the severity that we're witnessing.\nToday we're bringing together leaders from inside our Government and outside of our Government and courageous people who have been affected—and really affected—by this terrible affliction. In a joint campaign, we want to battle drug addiction and combat opioid, and we have to do it—the crisis.\nWe're fortunate to have Governor Chris Christie with us, a friend of mine, a great friend of mine. A very, very early endorser—in fact, an immediate endorser—once he got out of the race. [Laughter] He liked himself more than he liked me. [Laughter] But other than that——\nGovernor Christopher J. Christie of New Jersey. I still do, sir, but that's all right. [Laughter]\nThe President. Other than that, he's been great. And he's a very effective guy, I will tell you, he's—to have you working on this——\nGov. Christie. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. And a great moment, actually, if people remember, was you talking about your friend. That was probably your greatest moment during the campaign for President, and it showed how much you knew about this issue.\nGov. Christie. Thank you.\nThe President. So thank you very much, Chris.\nGov. Christie. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. We'll work directly with representatives from State and local governments, law enforcement, medical professionals, and victims. I especially want to thank Pam Garozzo—and where's Pam? Hi, Pam, how are you?\nMorrisville, PA, resident Pamela Garozzo. Hello, Mr. President.\nThe President. For being here. Pam sadly lost her son, beautiful boy, to drug addiction. And, Pam, we mourn your terrible loss, and we honor your strength and the fact that you're here. Ms. Garozzo. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. And he will not have died in vain, okay? We'll make sure: He will not have died in vain. So thank you, Pam. We appreciate it.\nWe're also thankful to welcome A.J. Solomon and Vanessa Vitolo, both of whom have fought addiction and are now symbols of hope and recovery, right?\nCaldwell, NJ, resident Vanessa A. Vitolo. Yes.\nThe President. Great job. We must get our citizens to help, and we need help. Everybody has to help. And we will not have to go through what Pam has gone through and so many other families in this country have gone through. We want to help people like A.J. and Vanessa, who struggled through the dark depths of addiction. Not easy. Not easy. And they found this bright promise of recovery.\nWe must also focus on prevention and law enforcement, which is why I've issued previous executive actions to strengthen law enforcement and dismantle criminal cartels. Drug cartels have spread their deadly industry across our Nation, and the availability of cheap narcotics—the cheap narcotics, some of it comes in cheaper than candy—has devastated our communities. It's really one of the biggest problems our country has, and nobody really wants to talk about it.\nVice President Pence mentioned this coming into the room. He said, this is a problem like nobody understands. And I think they're going to start to understand it. And more importantly, we have to solve the problem.\nOur Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, is working very hard on this problem. It takes a lot of his time, because this causes so much of the crime that you——\nAttorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III. It does.\nThe President. ——have to solve that problem.\nSo solving the drug crisis will require cooperation across government and across society, including early intervention to keep America's youth off this destructive path. We must work together, trust each other, and forge a true partnership based on the common ground of cherishing human life.\nSo this is a very, very important meeting, and maybe we'll go around the room, and we'll just say hello to everybody so we all know who we are. And then, the press will leave, and we'll start talking. [Laughter] Okay?\nGeneral Sessions, we know who you are.\nAttorney General Sessions. Right here.\nThe President. Keep up the good work. Go ahead.\nSecretary of Education Elisabeth P. DeVos. Betsey DeVos, Secretary of Education.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. David Shulkin, Secretary of VA.\nMs. Garozzo. Pam Garozzo, parent of Carlos.\nThe President. Yes.\nCherry Hill, NJ, resident Aaron J. Solomon. A.J. Solomon. Thanks for introducing me, Mr. President. Ms. Vitolo. Vanessa. Thank you so much for having me.\nThe President. Thank you, thank you, Vanessa.\nSecretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security.\nActing Assistant Secretary for Health Donald J. Wright. Don Wright, Acting Assistant Secretary for Health.\nThe President. Yes.\nDrug Enforcement Administration Acting Administrator Charles P. Rosenberg. Chuck Rosenberg. I run the DEA.\nOffice of National Drug Control Policy Acting Director Richard J. Baum. Richard Baum, Acting Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\nThe President. Great.\nHarvard Medical School professor of psychobiology Bertha K. Madras. Bertha Madras, Harvard Medical School.\nFlorida Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi. Pam Bondi, Attorney General of Florida.\nMajor League Baseball's New York Yankees former pitcher Mariano Rivera. Mariano Rivera, founder of the Mariano Rivera Foundation.\nThe President. Oh, they could use you now. [Laughter] You know, I think you'd make a hundred million a year, right? They'd pay him. I watched for many years, Mariano. I'd sit with George, and George always felt good when Mariano would throw.\nGov. Christie. That's right. [Laughter]\nThe President. He never had to worry.\nGov. Christie. No.\nThe President. He threw the heaviest pitch any time. I don't know—you made the ball like it weighed 30 pounds, right?\nMr. Rivera. Something like that.\nThe President. How about the broken bats? [Laughter] How many broken bats?\nGov. Christie. Too many.\nThe President. Right, those bats, they just used to crack, right?\nGov. Christie. More firewood.\nThe President. Thank you. Great honor.\nMr. Rivera. Thank you, sir. Thank you.\nThe President. And, Jared, thank you, and Chris. Chris, why don't you say a few words?\nGov. Christie. Well, Mr. President, first, to the President and the Vice President, thank you so much for focusing on this issue. As you know, Mr. Vice President, as the Governor of Indiana for 4 years, this issue causes enormous pain and destruction to everyday families in every State in this country. And that's why, Mr. President, I thought it was so important to bring Pam and A.J. and Vanessa here today for you meet them and hear directly from them their stories. I'm just so honored that the President would ask me to take on this task with the group that we've put together. And I'm thrilled to work with the Attorney General as well on the issues of prevention and interdiction of drugs so we don't get people hooked in the first place.\nBut the most important thing to me is, I think the President and I both agree that addiction is a disease, and it's a disease that can be treated, and that we need to make sure we let people know—the President talked about how folks don't talk about it. We talk about cancer, we talk about heart disease, we talk about diabetes, and we're not afraid to talk about it. But people are afraid and ashamed to talk about drug addiction. And while they don't talk about it, we lose lives, lives of good, good people.\nIn the end, the President ended by saying—talking about life. And he and I are both pro-life. The difference with the President and I is, we're pro-life for the whole life, not just for the 9 months in the womb, but for the whole life. Every life is an individual gift from God. And no life is irredeemable, and people make mistakes; we all have. The people who make the mistakes of drug use—and it is a mistake—we can't throw their life away. The President and I believe that every life is an individual gift from God and is precious.\nAnd I think that's why it was such an important issue to him in the campaign and why I'm so honored to work with a President who understands the value of life and the value of second chances. And that's what this Commission, I hope, is going to be about, to be able to give he and the Vice President the best suggestions we possibly can about how to have a national fight against this epidemic.\nSo, Mr. President, thank you for your confidence in all of us, and thank you for your support.\nThe President. Thank you very much, Chris. Maybe, Vanessa, you can tell a little bit of your story and how it's turned out so beautifully. We're so proud of you.\nMs. Vitolo. Don't put me on the spot, but—[laughter]—so, first of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you so much to bringing this whole platform to a national level. You are literally—everyone at this table is—saving lives. There are people dying every single day, and it's heartbreaking.\nAnd, Governor Christie, I need you to know that I draw so much strength and courage from you, you standing up for people that had nearly given up completely. That's extraordinary.\nI come from a small town in South Jersey. My aunt is a teacher, and she taught me the importance of education. My uncle is a firefighter. He taught me the importance of law and order. I went to a private high school. I was a cheerleader. I went to college, where I joined a sorority. After I left college, I had an injury and was prescribed pain killers, and so quickly, it took off from there. I didn't know anything about heroin. I was never warned, not that it's anybody else's fault; I take full responsibility.\nThe President. So this all began very innocently with an injury.\nMs. Vitolo. Absolutely, yes, with a prescription of pain killers.\nThe President. And what was it? What was the drug they gave?\nMs. Vitolo. Percocet.\nThe President. I see. Ms. Vitolo. And then, from Percocet, it went to oxy. And then from oxy, it went to heroin, because it is definitely, like you said, more accessible and so much cheaper. Very quickly, I lost everything. I was homeless. I chose to be homeless. I was living on the streets of Atlantic City. I was in and out of jail, and I was lucky enough to see some kind of light where I was—became a drug court participant at the court system that we have in New Jersey, which saved my life. They sent me to a long-term treatment facility, Integrity House, in New Jersey, and they saved my life.\nThe President. How hard was that, getting off this horrible stuff? How hard was it for you?\nMs. Vitolo. Physically, it was so hard. And I felt that was the hardest part. But then, a couple of months later, comes the psychological aspect of it, and you still think that you need it, because you're still not as happy when you're happy, you're still not as sad. It's—you have no feelings. It's like you're a shell. And it takes over your whole life—to choose to be homeless instead of live with your parents; to choose not to speak to your family.\nThe President. And what do your parents say during this whole process? They—because I'm looking at you, you're, like, all-American perfect. I mean, you're a perfect person. [Laughter] And I'm saying it's hard to believe that you're living on the streets.\nMs. Vitolo. Well, it was so hard for my family. My mom would drive the streets of Atlantic City begging people to find me. She couldn't find me. I was that lost in every aspect of the word. In jail, like I said, I was sent to Integrity House, and they saved my life. They gave me a second chance at life. And from there, I went to a halfway house, I got a job where I quickly moved up. I'm now a manager. Got my own apartment. I'm graduating drug court this year. And it's amazing the opportunities that have been given to me. I'm sitting across from you right now. [Laughter] Three years ago, I didn't have a place to live, and today I'm here to represent the light that can be born out of the defeat of this darkness.\nIt's—there is hope, and there is a tomorrow, and there is a day after that. You just have to fight for it. And people have to know that there's people fighting for them too, because you give up. You—there becomes a point where you feel as if you have nothing. You already ruined everything, so there's no point to get sober. But I'm here to show you that there is hope. You can get better. There is a better way, and there is a better life. And I wish I could tell you the heartbreak that I feel with the people that are overdosing every day and dying, and the families that have to go through that suffering, because there is no need. We can help somebody. We can change this. And that's the most amazing thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\nAnd I would like to thank each and every one of you for giving me this opportunity. It means the world to me. It is my life. I used to think that being an addict was my downfall. But look at me, I'm here today; it's obviously made me a stronger and better person. That's all I've got.\nThe President. Incredible story. Thank you very much. Amazing, amazing job. Thank you very much, Vanessa. And we'll talk to you in a little while.\nMs. Vitolo. Okay.\nThe President. A.J.? And I know how successful your father is and what a great man he is, so that also put pressure on you in a different way, right?\nMr. Solomon. Yes, well, I didn't end up going into politics, so—[laughter].\nThe President. Don't do it, A.J. [Laughter] Mr. Solomon. So, I mean, Vanessa really spelled it out. But I grew up in a little town in South Jersey called Haddonfield. It's a picturesque town, really good schools. My dad now is a Supreme Court Justice in the State of New Jersey. Thank you for the appointment, Governor. [Laughter]\nGov. Christie. You're welcome. [Laughter]\nMr. Solomon. And my mom also serves in State government. And I grew up, I was a good student. I was an athlete. I found alcohol and other drugs, and I was probably well on my way to having an issue, but then I found OxyContin. My dad got in an accident, and I decided that it would be a good idea to try it. And that's really where my story started. You know, now——\nThe President. Were you immediately hooked? Because I hear so much about OxyContin. Were you immediately hooked?\nMr. Solomon. Yes. When I did my first one, I remember doing it and thinking, this is how I want to live the rest of my life. I was always searching for something outside of myself that would make me feel better. People think the drug is the problem, and to some extent, its accessibility is. But addiction is a disease that I always had, and it just had to be unlocked. And that's what I feel OxyContin did for me.\nAnd when that happened—you know, now I'm a brother and a son and a business owner—I own a treatment center, which is awesome. And I love it. It's—I'm so happy I went that route instead of—I was on track—I was on the Governor's advance team. Not that I didn't love it. [Laughter] But I really enjoy what I do helping other alcoholics and addicts. Back then, I was——\nThe President. Do you have still an alcohol problem?\nMr. Solomon. I don't drink. I don't do any drugs.\nThe President. But that was—you could see you were going to have that problem. But you found this OxyContin?\nMr. Solomon. Yes. And I'm—I was a thief and a liar, and I ended up homeless. Different story: My parents did not want me home. I was living out of my car, and then I ended up going to a long-term treatment center. And I accepted what I was: that I was an addict. And I would rather have died than live with that. So I left. My plan was to kill myself. I wasn't able to get home. So I surrendered.\nAnd a lot of people don't believe this part of the story—and whatever someone's conception of God or a higher power is—I got on my knees on a shuttle back to treatment; I hadn't used. And I said, God, either please just let me die—because my plan was to shoot myself; I didn't have a gun—let me die, or just let me get this. And I swear to you that that obsession—that Vanessa talked about—to use was lifted that day. And my goal now in life is to help another alcoholic and an addict.\nAnd I think back then I would have rather died than had this disease. But now, a normal person can be miserable, and they can be angry and resentful, and that's just how they'll live their life. Me, if I get angry, resentful, if I'm miserable, I'll drink, and then I'll do dope—heroin. And then, I will die. So I'm grateful.\nThe President. But not anymore—not anymore, right? Mr. Solomon. I don't have—I'm not allowed to be miserable. I have to be trying to get the most out of life. Normal people don't have that. They won't die if they don't do that. So I'm grateful that I am what I am. Yes, I guess that's it.\nThe President. That's an amazing story, A.J. Wow.\nMr. Solomon. Thank you.\nThe President. How did you get off it? How did you get—did you go to a center or something? Or what happened?\nMr. Solomon. I did. I went in the mountains in Arizona to this place, and I was only coming off opiates. And they said—it was this tall guy, I'll never forget, his name was Bird—he said, \"What are you coming off of?\" I said, \"Opiates.\" He said: \"You don't need detox. You'll feel like you're going to die, but you won't die.\" And they put me in the center, and I detoxed cold turkey. And——\nThe President. And what was that like?\nMr. Solomon. It's like 20 times worse than the flu, but the anxiety is the worst part, the suicidal ideations crawling out of your skin. It's—I mean, if I had drugs in front of me, I would have done them. It's——\nThe President. So he was right?\nMr.  Solomon. Oh, yes. Yes, he was right.\nThe President. But you got through it? How long did that take?\nMr. Solomon. Two weeks.\nThe President. It was 2 weeks of——\nMr. Solomon. Physical.\nThe President. They used to call it cold turkey, right?\nMr. Solomon. Cold turkey.\nThe President. Do they still do that?\nMr. Solomon. Yes.\nThe President. No way. So you went through 2 weeks of that, and that was hell?\nMr. Solomon. Yes.\nThe President. But then, you knew you were going to get better?\nMr. Solomon. No, then, the mental obsession came, and I wanted to use so badly, but I had accepted what I was, and I knew I couldn't. So I was—I wanted the obsession to stop. It's—I wanted my brain to stop yelling at me to pick up. I didn't want to be that person anymore. So I figured I'd kill myself, and it would stop. But I—my dad—you talked about how powerful he is, he somehow cancelled all my personal credit cards. I still don't know how he did it. [Laughter] And I wasn't able to get on a plane to get home to get what I needed to end my life. And so I got on my knees and prayed, and that was really the beginning.\nThe President. So he did you a great service when he did that?\nMr. Solomon. He did. The President. Smart guy. You have done an amazing job. It's so great. Not easy. Not easy, right, A.J.?\nMr. Solomon. No, not easy.\nThe President. But we're very proud of you.\nChris. [Applause] Very proud of you.\nGov. Christie. And Mr. President, Pam works in the New Jersey State Department of Education. And she's someone who came to the candlelight vigil that I held right before Christmas for addicts in New Jersey and their families. And Pam wants to tell you the story about her son Carlos.\nMs. Garozzo. Yes. First of all, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Cabinet, and guests: This is an extreme honor. I am here, unfortunately, because my son is no longer here.\nAs Governor Christie said, I came to his candlelight vigil celebrating the fact—with our Education Commissioner, who is my boss—that my son was 10 months clean. He had been a year and a half clean before that, before he had a relapse, one of many, one of several. Just celebrating his life and celebrating the lives of everybody who have—who are in recovery.\nAnd then, later in December—actually that—before that, I just want to introduce you.\n[At this point, Ms. Garozzo showed the participants photographs of her son Carlos Castellanos.]\nThis is my son, Carlos. He's wearing a suit because on December 3—this is not his—was not his normal attire as a 23-year-old. [Laughter] On December 3, he was here at my church with my husband Mike and me—Mike, who is seated behind me and to the left—walking me down the aisle on my wedding day, one of the happiest days of my life. Carlos was healthy, happy, thriving, working, getting ready to go back to school, had a job, had a steady girlfriend, had everything together—10½ months clean.\nSo celebrating him at the candlelight vigil, previously having been at our wedding on December 3, and then 3 weeks later, on December 23, two police detectives show up at our door and tell me the news that no parent ever wants to hear. And we just didn't understand. And because this is a disease, you don't understand the dynamics of it. You can't—you're not—nothing prepares you for this journey.\nUnfortunately, my son OD'd after having been clean for 10½ months, OD'd on a drug that was laced with fentanyl. So he died immediately.\nThe President. Which is getting worse and worse I hear, Jeff.\nMs. Garozzo. Yes.\nThe President. Getting just out of control.\nMs. Garozzo. So Carlos started smoking marijuana when he was 15½ years old, and for him—and he'd be the first to tell you this—it's absolutely for him a gateway drug. It led to heroin, cocaine, crystal meth. At 18, when he was a senior in high school, with months to graduate, he had a crystal meth overdose. And by the time I got to the hospital—because his friend drove him there; I didn't even know that he was doing this to this extent—by the time I got to the hospital, the ER doctor came out and said: \"You need to call your family now. We don't think there's anything we can do for your son.\" We managed to transfer him to another hospital. He got the care that he needed. He was in a coma for 3 days and suffered some minor memory loss from that.\nAnd of course, at this time as an 18-year-old, said, oh, I'm never going to touch anything again, I'm going to stay clean. Had him in a program. But less than a couple months later, he's back in the streets not only taking drugs, but got caught smoking pot, ended up in jail. I had told him early on, I will put every penny, every dime I have into your recovery and getting you clean and helping you stay clean and supporting you a hundred percent. But if you end up in trouble with the law, there is nothing I'm doing for you, because you have to figure out the way out of that.\nSo he was in jail a couple of times. He actually went through cold turkey in jail getting clean. When he was clean for a period of almost a year and a half, during that time, he was going back to school. He was at this point around 20 years old—20, 21—was working, volunteering at a recovery house, working with people trying to help them work through their program. Speaking—he spoke regionally at a conference in West Virginia. They selected him because he's a young kid, and they figured he would be a good spokesperson, maybe be able to speak to people's hearts.\nSadly, as I said, he did pass. What—nothing in parenting prepares you to deal with the fact that Mike and I will outlive our son; that his sisters, who he idolized and who were so close to him, won't see him anymore; that there will be empty seats at the Thanksgiving table; that Christmas presents—we won't be able to give. I'll miss his laughter. I'll miss his smile. I'll miss him, his hug. I'll miss his dry, witty sense of humor.\nWhen I asked him if he would walk me down the aisle for our wedding—my wedding to Mike, he asked me, what does that entail? Sure, I think I can do it. But what does that mean? And I said—I explained to him, and he said, oh, but I'm pretty sure—I've watched enough TV to know that I have to take Mike on a fishing trip and see if he measures up. [Laughter]\nHe was constantly—he's just that kind of guy. He was just—I had people coming up to us at the life celebration, saying, your son is amazing. You don't know, your son saved me. Your son was one of the people who came and dragged me out of Philly, the tenement house that I was living in, a flophouse, and took me to his place and gave me money that he really didn't have, just to—and brought me to meetings.\nSo this is why I'm here. I'm here because I'd like to see nationally what's happening—what Governor Christie has managed to have happen in New Jersey, with, of course, the help of the legislators there to make the programs for recovery accessible and affordable to all. Because this is—I was fortunate to have a good insurance plan. But there did come a point where Carlos needed to be in a program that wasn't entirely covered by insurance, and they wanted to exit him in 4 days.\nNow, 4 days in a recovery program—for those of you who have had no experience—you guys know—that's nothing. Carlos begged to stay in. So we scrambled, got the money, and were able to keep him in.\nI'm here so that parents—no parent should have to bury their child. No parent should have to wander—as Vanessa said, I did the drives looking for Carlos at all hours of the day and night. Nobody should have to go through this. This is entirely something that can be dealt with, and I appreciate what you are willing to do in shedding a light on this. The President. If Carlos stayed longer in the program, would he have been in better shape? Would it have possibly saved him? Or not really?\nMs. Garozzo. Well, I think so. He was in a couple of programs, Mr. President, for a period of—one program that was very successful.\n[At this point, a participant coughed.]\nThe President. Do you want some water? Are you okay?\nMs. Garozzo. I'm good.\nThe President. No, I'm just saying—behind you. I think she——\nMs. Garozzo. Oh, I'm sorry. [Laughter]\nThe President. I think she's, sort of, in bad shape.\nMs. Garozzo. He was in a program for 35 days. That was his most successful program. As A.J. mentioned, Carlos had an underlying problem with self-esteem and feeling good about himself. He just never could quite get there, even though he was an accomplished musician. He had a scholarship to a prestigious university. As a freshman going in, he was accepted into an engineering program that normally that didn't happen. He had a lot of gifts and talents, but he just never saw them. He was always looking for how can I escape. How can I—and like A.J., he also thought several times about suicide.\nSo I think it's treating the whole person. It's not just the disease of addiction, but it's what is causing you to go after the drug, to seek it out, to stay with it. And once you're hooked, you're hooked. But what—how can you work within yourself, with help, to feel good about yourself, to feel that you're worthy. Everybody is loved. Everybody should feel loved. As Governor Christie said, every life is a precious life. And I believe, Governor, you also said that every life is worthy of being reclaimed. And unfortunately, Carlos couldn't entirely reclaim his life.\nAnd behind everybody who is trying, who's suffering with addiction or in recovery, there's parents and there's family just like me.\nThe President. Thank you, Pam. Carlos sounds like he was a great guy, and I know how tough it is. So many people go through it, and we appreciate your being here.\nMs. Garozzo. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. Jeff, will you have anything to say?\nAttorney General Sessions. Well, I just want to thank you for sharing your stories, because that's what we're all here about, and we're seeing a surge in drug abuse and addiction.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine had—I think our DEA commissioned it—pointed out that with regard to heroin, we've got more availability, lower price, and much higher purity. That creates more addiction quicker, I think. And it's a very dangerous situation. You throw fentanyl into that too. And I do believe, Mr. President, we took—and when I became a United States attorney in '81, and the President and others led, the Education Department led—and it took 20 years, but we reduced drug abuse in America, addiction, and death dramatically.\nIt's begun now to start back up. And I think if we apply——\nThe President. When did this start again? It's so bad. When did it start, would you say—over the last how many years—where it really took the big spike up? Attorney General Sessions. I think the fentanyl brought the—noticed here—Chuck, maybe—the DEA Director Chuck Rosenberg——\nThe President. You would know that. When do you think it really started spiking up, Chuck?\nActing Director Rosenberg. Mr. President, there have been spikes in the past. We've seen spikes in '05, '06, and '07. I'd say in the last 8 to 10 years, though, the trajectory has been awful. And there's a number of pieces to it.\nOne is that we consume, as Americans, most of the world's supply of hydrocodone and oxycodone. And as these good folks have attested to, once you get hooked on that, heroin is cheaper and more plentiful. And folks just make that transition.\nWe have to change the culture. I think we can. One of the things we do at DEA—and I'm extraordinarily proud of our men and women—we do law enforcement really well. But ever since I was a brand new Federal prosecutor many, many years ago, I never thought we would enforce or prosecute our way out of this. That's part of it. It's a really important part of it.\nBut we've also at the DEA now turned to education, prevention. We talk about those things all the time. I want folks to know, if I may, sir, we do a national take-back program twice a year. The next one is on April 29, and people can drop off at 5,000 sites around the country—courtesy of DEA and our local partners—anything in their medicine cabinet that they don't want. Last year, we took in 1.6 million pounds of stuff. It includes everything.\nThe President. That's great.\nActing Director Rosenberg. But we're going to do that relentlessly twice a year, encourage people to turn in these drugs, and try and break this cycle.\nThe President. So it's been really spiked over the last 8 to 10 years. Would that have anything to do with the weakening of the borders? Because a lot of it comes from the southern border.\nActing Director Rosenberg. A lot of it comes through Mexico. A lot of it's produced in Mexico. I should say this: We've worked closely with our Mexican counterparts. There are a lot of brave men and women down there trying to help us do what we do. Secretary Kelly knows that as well as anyone.\nA lot of it also comes from Asia. I was recently in China; I met with our counterparts there. And a lot of the synthetics, fentanyl and carfentanil, which is even worse than fentanyl, is produced in China. And our Chinese counterparts have added some of those drugs to their banned list, precluding it from—or hopefully, precluding it from leaving China and coming into North America.\nSo there's a lot of work to be done. You've got a lot of smart people around this table. But I can tell you from the perspective of the DEA, sir, law enforcement is crucial. Education and prevention and treatment is equally crucial.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Thanks, Chuck.\nActing Director Rosenberg. Yes, sir.\nThe President. All right, thank you very much, folks.\nOpioid Addiction Prevention Efforts Q. Will you talk about this on the road? Are you going to take this issue on the road, President Trump?\nThe President. Yes, we will. Big issue, very, very big issue. Thank you, thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-03-29", "title": "Remarks at a Listening Session on Opioids and Drug Abuse and an Exchange With Reporters"}

What an amazing audience this is. [Laughter] So many young faces that represent the future of leadership in our country. So true. Melania and I are deeply honored to join you. And, Melania, thank you for being here.\nSo as you know, Melania is a very highly accomplished woman and really an inspiration to so many. And she is doing some great job. In fact, I shouldn't say this, but her poll numbers went through the roof last week. [Laughter] What was that all about? Through the roof. She has to give us the secret, Mike, right? [Laughter] Anyway, I appreciate it very much.\nMy Cabinet is full of really incredible women leaders. Administrator Linda McMahon, who has been a friend of mine for a long time—[applause]—long time. She's done an incredible job in business, by the way. Administrator Seema Verma, Secretary Betsy DeVos, and, of course, my good friend from South Carolina who is a very tough competitor, I want to tell you—[laughter]—Nikki Haley, Ambassador. She is doing fantastically well. And we're also joined, of course, by Florida attorney general, highly respected, Pam Bondi. So I want to thank you, Pam. Thank you.\nElaine Chao, our Secretary of Transportation, who's a real expert. She was Secretary of Labor, but she said, I really wanted to be Secretary of Transportation. That's her real expertise, and she's doing incredibly. She would have been here, but she's celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Department of Transportation right now as we speak. And we're going to work on infrastructure, and we are going to put up one of the big and great infrastructure bills of all time. We're going to get our infrastructure fixed in our country, and we're going to rebuild our country, and that's what we need. Lots of jobs also.\nAnd I want to thank Ford; you saw their big announcement yesterday. And so many others are announcing tremendous numbers of jobs. They're not leaving our country anymore, folks. They're not leaving; they're staying, and they're building right here.\nSo we really have these incredibly strong and dedicated leaders, and they're with me and they're with us. And I'm very happy about it. And I want to thank you as being representative, very much, of our group. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\nAnd I'm so proud that the White House and our administration is filled with so many women of such incredible talent. This week, as we conclude Women's History Month, we honor a great woman of American history. Since the very beginning, women have driven—and I mean each generation of Americans—toward a more free and more prosperous future.\nAmong these patriots are women like the legendary Abigail Adams—right?—who, during the founding, urged her husband to remember the rights of women. She was very much a pioneer in that way.\nWe've been blessed with courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery and went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom, first on the Underground Railroad and then as a spy for the Union Army. She was very, very courageous, believe me.\nAnd we've had leaders like Susan B. Anthony—have you heard of Susan B. Anthony?—[laughter]—I'm shocked that you've heard of her—who dreamed of a much more equal and fair future, an America where women themselves, as she said, \"helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers.\" And that's what's happening more and more. Tough competition out there, I want to tell you. [Laughter]\nFrom the untamed frontiers of the Western Plains to the skyscrapers of Manhattan, American women in every generation have shown extraordinary grit, courage, and devotion. Our present generation stands on the shoulders of these titans—and that's what they were and are—titans. Only by enlisting the full potential of women in our society will we be truly able to—you have not heard this expression before—make America great again. [Laughter] Good expression. [Applause]\nThank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It's been a lot of fun. [Laughter] And we didn't get that one from Madison Avenue, right? [Laughter]\nMy administration will work every day to ensure that our economy is a place where women can work, succeed, and thrive like never before. That includes fighting to make sure that all mothers and all families have access to affordable childcare. We want every daughter in America to grow up in a country where she can believe in herself, believe in her future, and follow her heart and realize her dreams. And we want a country that celebrates family, that celebrates community, and that creates a safe and loving home for every child—every child. That's what we want.\nEarlier this year, I met with a remarkable group of leaders. They were women entrepreneurs from all across the country. They started their businesses from absolutely nothing and today have grown them into successful enterprises that employ hundreds—and in certain cases, even thousands—of people. Just think of what our country could achieve if we unleashed the power of women entrepreneurs nationwide. Think of that.\nSo, as a man, I stand before you as President. But if I weren't President, I wouldn't be happy to hear that statement. That would be a very scary statement to me, because there's no way we can compete with you. [Laughter] So I would not be happy. Just wouldn't be happy.\nOne of the business owners I met, Lisa Phillips, used to be homeless. She's now the owner of an event-planning company, and she trains homeless youth in Baltimore for good-paying jobs. Lisa had a message for all of us. As she put it, \"This is a country of chances . . . if you're willing to work hard, you'll get the chance.\" And she means it, and she's become very successful. She's terrific.\nLisa is right, but we have to fight to ensure that more people have the chance to succeed. To do that, we must believe in each other, and we must dare to dream of a better, brighter, and more prosperous future for all of our citizens. We have no choice. That's what we have to do.\nAnd to be honest, whether you're a woman or whether you're a man, you have that same dream: You want to be able to dream. You just have a big advantage over us. [Laughter] You know why?\n[At this point, the President gestured toward his head.]\nRight there. [Laughter] There's a lot of truth to that, Mike, right?\nThat's what I want for each and every one and each and every one of our daughters and our granddaughters. And I know, together, we will get there. I want every young person in the audience today and watching from home—and they're all over the place; those cameras are all over—[laughter]—to know that the future truly belongs to you. We are Americans, and we will not stop until we have achieved our dreams.\nI want to thank you very much for being here. It's my great honor, I will tell you, to be here. In fact, Melania said, this is something I just have to be at. She feels so strongly about it. [Applause] She feels so strongly about it.\nSo thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

Matt, you had a phenomenal story today. (Laughter.) Get that joke? If you didn't, look it up. A little delayed reaction to that. (Laughter.)\nBefore I get into the events of today, there's a few items I wanted to update you on, things that have happened since our last briefing yesterday.\nThe President spoke with Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq to thank him for his productive visit and meeting on March 20th.\nA readout of that call should have been issued after the pool last night.\nYesterday, he also notified Congress that the national emergency declared Executive Order 13694 regarding malicious cyber-enabled attacks will continue beyond April 1st, 2017.\nAs you all know, this notification is required by statute in order to extend the national emergency that the past administration declared.\nThe President believes that the significant cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to our national security and economic prosperity, and therefore he has determined that it was necessary to continue this national emergency.\nLast night, a federal judge in Hawaii put an indefinite hold on the President's executive order that was issued on national security. The Department of Justice is reviewing the ruling and is considering the best way to defend the President's lawful and necessary order.\nThis ruling is just the latest step that will allow the administration to appeal. Just a week ago, the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia upheld the President's order on the merits. The White House firmly believes that this order is lawful and necessary, and will ultimately be allowed to move forward.\nThis morning, we announced that the President will host President Xi of China at Mar-a-Lago on April 6th and 7th. The President looks forward to meeting with President Xi and exchanging views on each other's respective priorities and to chart a way forward on a bilateral relationship between our two nations. They will discuss the issues of mutual concern, including North Korea, trade, and regional security.\nNow, on to some of the events of today. This morning, the President had a meeting with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. The Secretary, along with the National Economic Council and the rest of the President's team of experts have been meeting with and hearing from stakeholders on all sides of the tax reform debate.\nTax reform has been a centerpiece of the President's economic agenda from the beginning of his campaign. The team is weighing the best option to develop a plan that will provide significant middle-class tax relief and make American businesses more competitive.\nEnacting the first significant tax reform since the 1980s is going to be a serious undertaking. And we are at the first stages of this process, beginning to engage with members of Congress, policy groups, business leaders, industry, constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders.\nTax reform has been a part of the political discussion for years, and, accordingly, lots of people have a lot of ideas about it. We intend to hear from them. He and his team will continue to meet with those who support and oppose the various policy options, as they all are still on the table, because the President is committed to delivering results that the American people and American businesses will be able to see and feel in their paychecks.\nOn the Hill this morning, the President was glad that the nominations of his Secretary of Agriculture-designate Governor Sonny Perdue and Secretary of Labor-designate advanced out of committee. Although he was disappointed to see that Democratic senators who had previously expressed their support for Alex Acosta, the Labor Secretary-designee, nonetheless, while they had previously supported him, seem to have stuck to a party-line vote. The President looks forward to having them officially on the team and in the Cabinet as soon as possible.\nAlso this morning, the Department of Commerce and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) announced that AT&T will build the first nationwide [wireless] broadband, a network dedicated to America's first responders. This step was part of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations on improving the ability of our police, fire, and emergency medical personnel to communicate seamlessly across jurisdictions, which is critical to their missions. It's also a sign of the incredible ability of public-private partnerships to drive innovation and solve some of our biggest problems while also creating jobs and growing the economy.\nBack to the schedule, this afternoon the President hosted a legislative affairs lunch on opioid and drug abuse. The lunch was an opportunity to discuss the goals and agenda of the President's Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, which he established yesterday.\nThe commission, which is going to be chaired by new Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is the next step in the President's promise to the American people that he would take real action to keep drugs from pouring into our country and corrupting our communities. Under Governor Christie's leadership, and working closely with the White House Office of American Innovation, the commission will bring together leaders on both sides of the aisle to find the best ways to treat and protect the American people from this epidemic.\nMany members in attendance at the lunch played a key part in passing the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, also known as CARA, the first major federal addiction legislation in 40 years, which authorized over $181 million to fight the opioid epidemic. Part of the mission of the President's commission will be to ensure that those funds are spent efficiently and effectively. Too many lives are at stake to risk wasting any money on this effort.\nMoving on, later this afternoon the President will welcome Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark for a working visit.\nWe'll have a readout on their bilateral meeting for you at its conclusion.\nA couple follow-ups from yesterday: I know Hunter asked about the House and the Senate passage disapproving of the Federal Communications [Commission's] regulations on privacy rules from last year. So let me just expand on that a little and get to your question.\nThe White House supports Congress using its authority under the Congressional Review Act to roll back last year's FCC rules on broadband regulation. The previous administration, in an attempt to treat Internet service providers differently than edge providers, such as Google and Facebook, reclassified them as common carriers -- much like a hotel or another retail outlet -- and opened the door to an unfair regulatory framework. This will allow all service providers to be treated fairly and consumer protection and privacy concerns to be reviewed on an equal playing field.\nThe President pledged to reverse this type of federal overreach in which bureaucrats in Washington take the interests of one group of companies over the interests of others, picking winners and losers.\nThe President has signed more legislation under the Congressional Review Act, ending job-killing rules and regulations than all previous Presidents combined already, and he will continue to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\nJeff was here yesterday, Roberta is here now -- but following up on Jeff's question, he asked about the administration's position on the Paris climate treaty. We are currently reviewing issues related to the agreement, and expect to have a decision by the time of the G7 Summit, late May-ish, if not sooner.\nBefore I take your questions, I wanted to speak quickly about Judge Gorsuch again and the process behind his nomination and confirmation. From the beginning, I think the President has been clear and 100 percent transparent about his choices, if he had been elected, who he would choose from. As a matter of fact, I'd say that the level of transparency is probably unprecedented in modern times, at least.\nDuring the campaign, he gave the American people a list of 21 judges which he would pick his choice for the Supreme Court from. The American people sent him to the White House to nominate one of those judges -- and he did it. Prior to the President making his final decision, the White House spoke with 29 senators -- more than half of whom were from the Democrat side of the aisle, including every Democrat member of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- to seek their advice and consent on the nomination. The consensus was that the President's pick should be a respected mainstream judge.\nAs I've laid out many times before, from unanimous consent of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to the extraordinarily low rate of majority opinions accompanied by dissent, Judge Gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream, respected judge. He has offered the Senate plenty of material to vouch for that. Since his nomination, Judge Gorsuch met with nearly 80 senators.\nIn response to requests from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch provided the following: over 70 pages of written answers about his personal records in response to 299 questions for the record by Democrats on the committee, the most in recent history, which he submitted within six days of receiving the questions; over 75,000 pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written work going back as far as college; and over 180,000 pages of email and paper records related to the judge's time at the Department of Justice\nIn fact, the Department of Justice provided access to many documents that would normally be guarded by various privileges, in a historically unprecedented move in the spirit of cooperation with Senate Democrats. And the judge sat for three rounds and nearly 20 hours of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he was asked nearly 1,200 questions, almost twice as many as Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or Ginsburg.\nThe White House and the judge did all of this in the hopes that Senate Democrats, many of whom already had announced their intent to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination, would look beyond their political game and see for themselves how eminently qualified he is to sit on the Supreme Court.\nUnfortunately, it looks more and more like Senate Democrats would rather do all that they did in reading and questioning for nothing more than for political theater.\nFinally, before I take your questions, a letter was transmitted just recently to the ranking member and chairman of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that said, \"In the ordinary course of business, national security staff discovered documents that we believe are in response to your March 15, 2017 letter to the intelligence community seeking 'documents necessary to determine whether information collected on U.S. persons was mishandled and leaked.'\" We have and will invite the Senate and House ranking members and Chairman up to the White House to view that material in accordance with their schedule.\nWith that, I'd be glad to take a few of your questions.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I'm trying to gauge the probability of a government shutdown at the end of April. Are your directions to the Capitol Hill to hold firm on the spending cuts that the President wants, or to try to wheel and deal and get a bill that can keep the government open?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that they're mutually exclusive. I think we want --\nQ: You wouldn't want pushback on Capitol Hill from some --\nMR. SPICER: There generally is. But I think that we want both. I think we want to maintain some of the spending priorities as well as some of the reductions in the 2017 budget. We want to do so responsibly and do so within the priorities that the President has laid out.\nI think his funding requests and priorities are laid out in the budget that Director Mulvaney detailed and sent up for the remainder of 2017. There are some key things in that, and I think that it is going to begin a conversation that we will continue to have with the House and Senate.\nBut I don't think both of those goals are mutually exclusive. Obviously, we don't want the government to shut down, but we want to make sure that we're funding the priorities of the government.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to ask about some news that the President made today with a tweet that he put out on Twitter. He seemed to be picking a fight with the Freedom Caucus; and the Freedom Caucus, as you know, has 30 members. Does the President realize how important this caucus is, this coalition is, in terms of passing a replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act and passing the rest of his legislative agenda?\nMR. SPICER: Well, of course he understands that the goal of all legislation is get to a majority in the House, majority in the Senate. But at the end of the day, he recognizes that he has a bold and robust agenda that he is trying to enact that he ran on and told the American people that he would do when he was President, and he's going to get the votes from wherever he can.\nQ: Can he pass that agenda without the help of the Freedom Caucus?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's two questions. One is, I mean, mathematically, yes. But secondly, I think that there's a few members of the Freedom Caucus, both prior to last Friday's vote and since then, who have expressed a willingness to want to work with him rather than necessarily as a bloc. And I think that there continues to be some promising signs with that.\nSo again, I think part of is, is that I think if people are more concerned with voting as a bloc than in what's in the best interests of their constituents and the American people, he's hoping that people will see the bigger picture, the goals that we outlined, and sometimes not let the really good be the enemy of the perfect.\nQ: He seemed to imply in that tweet that he would be in favor of primary-ing some individuals in the Freedom Caucus who oppose his agenda. Is that correct? Did I read that correctly?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to say -- I'm going to let the tweet speak for itself. For those of you who think -- or just for your understanding, it would be improper of me to discuss the election or defeat of any candidate from this podium.\nMatt.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions, if you don't mind.\nMR. SPICER: I want phenomenal questions from you.\nQ: That's what I'll give you. (Laughter.) First, we know now --\nMR. SPICER: You get it?\nQ: No, I got it. (Laughter.) So two White House officials, according to New York Times reporting, provided Representative Nunes with the information that he spoke about last week. And according to the Times, the senior director for intelligence on the NSC, who was hired by Michael Flynn, started going through these documents after the President's tweet -- the wiretapping tweet. So I'm wondering if the White House thinks it's appropriate for national security officials to be conducting what's basically a political task, which is trying to find information that then validates something the President said.\nMR. SPICER: So I read the report, and respectfully I think your questions assumes that the reporting is correct.\nQ: It does.\nMR. SPICER: And so I would just suggest to you that the letter that was submitted earlier to the ranking -- the chairman and the ranking members of the two committees -- two intelligence committees on the Hill, the reason that the White House has asked them to come up is to view that information.\nAnd again, I don't want to get in front of that. As I've said before, we are not as obsessed with the process as much as the substance. And I think that our goal is to make sure that the ranking members of both committees, as well as the chairman, see the information that -- the materials that are important to this, and then worry about the outcome at the end of this.\nQ: And then on a different topic, with Ms. Walsh's departure today, are you expecting any more staffing shakeups in the West Wing?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nCatherine.\nQ: Sean, are you saying that The New York Times reporting today is not correct on whoever was --\nMR. SPICER: I'm saying that in order to comment on that story, would be to validate certain things that I am not at liberty to do.\nQ: For days you haven't been able to tell us who he met with, what the circumstances were.\nMR. SPICER: And I understand that. And again, and I think that there is an assumption, as I've said before, we cannot condone that -- in the same way that you protect sources when I call you and say you've got 18 anonymous sources, and you go, well, I can't reveal my sources; Chairman Nunes in conducting an investigation and a review has an opportunity to have his sources.\nOur view was -- is that the smart move was to make all the materials available to the chairman and the ranking member of the relevant committees. And I understand the obsession with the process piece, but we are focused on the substance of it. And I think the goal is to make sure that people have the substance that are looking into this that we have asked to look into this --\nQ: So the White House did make materials available already?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, we have sent a letter within the past few hours to both of those committees informing them that we wanted to make that available to them.\nQ: And what kind of message do you think this sends to people watching this? Does it --\nMR. SPICER: I think it sends a message that we want them to look into this, that I think that -- as we have maintained from all along, that I think there's a belief that the President has maintained that there was surveillance that occurred during the 2016 election that was improper, and that we want people to look into this and take the appropriate legal responsible steps to both understand it and then address it.\nMajor.\nQ: I want to read to you something you said here at the podium on March 23rd when you were originally asked if the White House might have had any role in providing information to Chairman Nunes. You first said it didn't make any sense to you, and you went to say -- and I'm quoting you here: \"I don't know why he\" -- Chairman Nunes -- \"would brief the Speaker and then come down here to brief us on something that we would have briefed him on. It doesn't seem to make a ton of sense. So I'm not aware of it, but it doesn't really pass the smell test.\"\nThere is now reporting -- which I can't tell if you're disputing or not -- that identifies two people within this White House as the sources of this information. So I'm just trying to put these things together, where you said it \"doesn't pass the smell test\" on March 23rd. Now there's reporting that suggests that it is within the White House, that they were the sources of this. I'm just trying to put those two things together.\nMR. SPICER: All right, so number one, the first quote that you're reading, if you actually go back, I was responding to -- I was very clear that I said, \"Based on what Chairman Nunes has said\" -- the following doesn't make sense.\nQ: Okay, so within that --\nMR. SPICER: But that's an important part.\nQ: -- I'm gathering that you've learned something new since then, so please tell us what you've learned.\nMR. SPICER: Right, and again -- no, no, no, because again, Major, I've commented on this both yesterday and today, that your obsession with who talked to whom and when is not the answer here. It should be the substance.\nIn the same way that when you guys print a story with 18 anonymous sources, your obsession is the substance, it seems now that you continue to look at from a backwards prism, which is, \"What happened? Who drove in what gate? Who did they meet with? What were they wearing that day?\" as opposed to, \"What's the underlying substance of this? Did something happen in the 2016 election? Did leaks occur?\"\nWe are not going to engage actively in that kind of leaking that has been a problem. In fact, if you look at Obama's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around, that they went around and did this. And she said, \"That's why there are so many leaks.\"\nThey have admitted on the record that this was their goal -- to leak stuff. And they literally -- she said on the record \"Trump's team.\" There are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it. And I think that's really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets out.\nQ: But can't the process, from your vantage point, validate the importance of the substance?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a review that we've asked for probably --\nQ: And you've told us that you're willing to look into and ask questions about the process and provide us answers. That's all I'm trying to --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no -- no, don't -- please don't put words in my mouth. I never said I would provide you answers. I said we would look into it.\nThe responsible thing for us to do is to provide the individuals and the committees who are doing the review the materials that they're looking for -- or some of them. We don't know how many -- what they're exactly looking for, what they've seen, and what they haven't.\nOur goal is to be as forthright as possible. They asked the intelligence communities and others in a March letter for information. We are willing to provide them with the information that we have -- the materials that we have come across. And I think that is an important step.\nAgain, it is not -- our obligation is to make sure the review is done both in the House and the Senate as we asked for a few weeks ago, not to make sure that we illegally leak out information to you.\nQ: And when you say \"we have information,\" are you disputing the reports in the New York Times?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not commenting on the reports, Major. I just got asked the same question.\nQ: But you're saying \"we.\" So I'm just trying to find out, they're naming some people that work for the NSC, who work at this White House --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, I'm saying -- no, \"we\" meaning the White House, is not going to start confirming --\nQ: -- who have been named now publicly for the first time.\nMR. SPICER: I get it. We are not going to start commenting on one-off anonymous sources that publications publish.\nQ: If it were wrong, would you tell us?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into it. As I've just said, I get it. How many times you can ask the same question?\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions. The first, President Trump is pushing for a major tax cut, increases in defense and infrastructure spending, and the border wall. Does he think this agenda has to be deficit-neutral, or is he open to plans that might initially add to the debt?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think when it comes to tax reform, he's got three underlying goals. One is tax simplification, two is to lower the rates, and three is to grow jobs and the economy. And I think part of it is, is that if you look at it dynamically, as the plan develops -- and again, as I mentioned earlier, we're not there yet; we are beginning that process of engaging with stakeholders. As the plan develops and there's a cost put on it, that's going to be a decision that gets looked at as well as what are the economic growth and job-creation aspects to it.\nSo to answer that question without knowing what the full scope of it is, is looking at something and answering it in a vacuum.\nQ: And then, just to clarify one thing with the New York Times story, I know you won't identify Congressman Nunes as \"sources,\" but isn't it abundantly clear that at least some White House officials had to be involved in him getting information here because they would need to help them access the complex?\nMR. SPICER: I cannot get into who those individuals were.\nQ: Right, but it was someone at the White House, right?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, it's -- again, if I start going down the path of confirming and denying one thing, that we're going down a very slippery slope. I've made our position very clear on that.\nJessica.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Thank you for announcing the visit of the Chinese President. I have a couple of questions about that visit, if you'd entertain me. Can you talk about the location and how it was chosen for this visit?\nMR. SPICER: There is, as you can imagine, on any trip, no matter who the foreign leader is, there's a lot of discussion that goes back and forth between the White House, the State Department and the equivalents of the other head of governments, their appropriate counterparts. And those are the kind of things that go back and forth in terms of how long, the activities, what will be discussed. Every single thing is discussed on both sides.\nAnd so that was a long and ongoing negotiation with the government of China and with their representatives lasting several weeks now.\nQ: So how did you arrive at Mar-a-Lago as opposed to the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the back and forth. I would just suggest to you that both sides discussed various locations and topics and agendas and length, et cetera, and aspects to the trip. And this is what we've arrived at.\nQ: So what is the goal for the White House to accomplish during the visit?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a few things. One is, I think this is an opportunity for President Trump to develop a relationship in person with President Xi. He's spoken to him on the phone a few times. But we have big problems, and -- I mean, everything from the South China Sea, to trade, to North Korea. There are big issues of national and economic security that need to get addressed, and I think there's going to be a lot on the table when it comes to that over the two days that they will talk.\nQ: And lastly, the Chinese are expecting the White House to provide some sort of framework for the relationship to be viewed for. Are you prepared for that? And can you talk a little bit about what that framework might be?\nMR. SPICER: Can you expand on that a little?\nQ: Kind of put a floor under the relationship, looking for how to view the relationship. Obviously, you had the rebalance and the pivot in the prior administration. Is there a tagline or a vision for U.S.-China relations that you will roll out during this visit?\nMR. SPICER: We'll see. I'm not -- if you have any hashtags, let me know. But I think right now we're not worried so much about slogans as much as progress. There's a lot of big things that we need to accomplish with China, and I think that we will work on them.\nKristen.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Did the President direct anyone in this White House or in his national security team to try to find information or intelligence to back up his assertion about wiretapping?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'm not aware of anything directly. I'd have to look into that in terms of -- again, there's two sides to this. One is the information side, and two is the policy and the activities and the legal piece of what happened. And I don't -- those are big buckets, if you will.\nQ: So it's possible.\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on it.\nQ: And one more. Don't sort of the daily questions about this make it necessary to have some type of outside independent investigation to lift any lingering cloud that there may be?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Why?\nMR. SPICER: I think you have two committees looking into this. The FBI has been looking into this, as they mentioned at the hearing. I mean, how many do you want? I understand that you may not have --\nQ: Do you think the House intelligence investigation is still valid given all of these questions?\nMR. SPICER: How is it not valid? I'm asking --\nQ: There are all these questions about where Devin Nunes got his information from, was it politically motivated to lift that cloud. Would it not be smart to have an outside independent investigation?\nMR. SPICER: No -- well, again, I think you got the FBI, probably other intelligence committees that looked -- 17 of them issued a report earlier in terms of involvement in the 2016 election. And then you've got two congressional committees looking into it.\nSo I'm not really sure the exact need. I think that people are doing -- I understand sometimes there's a need for you guys to have more information and more sources. I think this is being done in a responsible way where people are being discussed -- what they know at an appropriate classification level and information is being shared.\nQ: Can you just quickly talk about the timing of inviting the leaders of this investigation to the White House now? Is it because of this report? Why not do that initially?\nMR. SPICER: I think a couple things. One is, they asked -- they tasked the various committees in mid-March to -- or the agencies, rather, to provide information. We felt we had information that was relevant, and I think there was some -- there's a desire to make sure that both sides of the aisle who are looking into this, as well as both chambers, had that information.\nAnita.\nQ: Eric Trump gave an interview a few days ago to Forbes Magazine in which he said that he would update his father regularly, perhaps quarterly, on the business, including giving profitability reports. So I had two questions about that. One is, have they spoken about the business since January? And two, how does this not violate what the President set out as the protocols for how he would deal with the business?\nMR. SPICER: Well, two things. I don't know if they've spoken. It's not -- this may be a question better directed to the Trump organization. But secondly, I think everything that he's done is in accordance with what the Counsel's Office and the ethics folks --\nQ: Just following up, I believe he said the he wasn't going to talk to his children, his sons, about the business. So how is that --\nQ: Again, I think everything that is being done in terms of reports or updates is being done in a consultation with the Counsel's Office. So I think that's --\nJustin.\nQ: I have two things I want to ask. The first is just to follow up on Major and ask about the substance. It's sort of unclear what you guys are telling the chairman and the ranking members you have. Is it information that would validate the President's claims about surveillance during the 2016 campaign? Or is it information about their broader Russia investigation? I'm trying to --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not here to share that. That's why we've invited them up to view it in a classified setting, in an appropriate setting. It's not to be shared with people that don't have the appropriate clearances and access to --\nQ: But you're not intending to imply that this is the information that Chairman Nunes has been talking about.\nMR. SPICER: No, what I'm suggesting is that there has been information that has been -- material that has been made come to light, and that we want to make sure that the people who are conducting the review have that information, have access to it.\nQ: And then, Westinghouse Center filed for bankruptcy yesterday. I'm wondering if that's prompted national security concerns in the administration, and if there is any effort within the administration to sort of help them navigate this bankruptcy, considering that the --\nMR. SPICER: I'll have to check on that. I think there's obviously a couple departments that would be interested in that.\nSteve.\nQ: Sean, I just want to ask you to elaborate more on what you have so far told us. You said that in the ordinary course of business, the national security staff discovered documents. Can you explain how these documents were uncovered? What does it mean \"in the course of business\"?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- no, I'm not. That's why we've invited them up into a classified setting, is for them to see these materials and understand it. This is not the setting that is appropriate to discuss that.\nQ: So who in the national security staff, then, uncovered the documents?\nMR. SPICER: Good question. That is not -- again, as I've mentioned multiple times, we're not here to go through the process. Our job is to get to the substance of this and to make sure that the people who have the appropriate access and authority to look into this matter, and then take appropriate steps.\nQ: Are you in a position right now to deny or rule out the possibility that members of the national security staff have already informed the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into any further details on this. I would just suggest to you -- again, if I can go back for a second to something that the Obama administration's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense noted very clearly on the record, that they were engaged in an effort to spread information about Trump officials that had come up in intelligence. That's not -- that is several networks. Evelyn Farkas made that proclamation about what was going on during the Obama administration regarding the Trump team. So that is something that they made very clear on the record.\nJohn.\nQ: A couple of things, Sean. First of all, on the Freedom Caucus, in response to the President's tweet, Congressman Amash of Michigan responded on camera, saying, most people don't like to be bullied -- in response to the President -- also saying that sending out such tweets is constructive in the 5th grade and it may allow a child to get his way, but that's not how government works. Could you take a moment to respond to Congressman Amash? Was the President trying to bully the Freedom Caucus?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think this is consistent with everything that he has said since Friday of last week. And I think that he is looking for members on both sides of the aisle, who want to be constructive, to achieve the goal of a patient-centered healthcare system. That's it, plain and simple.\nAnd I think that his comments and his tweets speak for themselves with respect to how he feels and why.\nQ: Following on that, is this a divide-and-conquer strategy?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's a math strategy, which is to get to 216 and pass an effort, and continue to move the agenda forward.\nQ: And then if I could, following on what Major said, you've accused people in this room several times of being more interested in the process than actually in substance of things. But when information is discovered by the Intelligence Committee Chairman in the House, at the White House, that is potentially exculpatory to what the President has tweeted out, and it's reported that one of the people who was involved in uncovering that information is a White House staff member who was kept in his position over the request of the National Security Advisor by the political leadership here at the White House, does the process not then take on some relevance?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the process in the sense that we are -- as I've noted, we have invited the chairman and the ranking members who are looking into this and reviewing the matter up here. That doesn't mean that we allow uncleared members from the media to come in and look at it. That means --\nQ: I'm not asking that question.\nMR. SPICER: No, you are. You said --\nQ: No, I'm not asking that question.\nMR. SPICER: But I think it is, because --\nQ: That's not what I asked. What I asked was, when you have that connection of dots all the way along, does the process, the prominence of this information not become relevant to the overall investigation?\nMR. SPICER: It's for the people who are conducting the review to decide that, not for the people in this room to decide it. It is up to the people who are cleared to look at that information and that material, to look at it and make their evaluations. And I think they are conducting their review. You've seen very clearly, both on the House side and then starting today on the Senate side, them looking into this matter. That is the appropriate venue, forum, and personnel to be reviewing it, plain and simple.\nQ: Sean, a quick follow up on that.\nMR. SPICER: Zeke.\nQ: You mentioned a couple of times --\nMR. SPICER: Zeke.\nQ: Thank you. Has the President already been briefed on this information --\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.\nQ: Has the President been briefed on this information that you're now inviting the congressional committee chairs to come in and view? And when was he briefed on it?\nMR. SPICER: I will look into that. I'm not entirely sure when or what the status of that is, but I can follow up on that.\nQ: So then why would you brief -- why would the White House brief congressional --\nMR. SPICER: I understand the question. Like I said, I will look into whether or not -- where that stands.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, thanks. A couple on taxes. The timeline here had been healthcare first, tax reform second. There was a Fox poll out, released yesterday, that said 73 percent of Americans want tax reform to happen this year. With healthcare now at least being on hold, is healthcare the number-one priority for this administration -- is tax reform the number-one priority for this administration at this point, or is healthcare still kind of taking up some of the oxygen?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't know that it's taking up oxygen. I think there's plenty of oxygen for both to go on. I think the President would still like to see it done. But I think there's no reason that we can't -- I mean, if you look at the timeline for tax reform, you're talking several months, and so I think the process is beginning on that, and I think you can have a dual-track strategy. It's not an either/or proposition.\nQ: And you described what was going on with the meeting today as the first phase. Can you lay out to us what is somewhat entailed with that first phase? Is the President being given detailed strategies? Or is it broad principles? What is involved in this first phase?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's a little of both. They're talking about the process that they intend to partake -- how this is going to lay out, who they're engaging with, how they're going to begin that process, and then some of the guiding principles in making sure that any updates that he has or any principles that he wants to suggest are incorporated into that plan as they begin to meet with stakeholders. But part of this is to level-set with him as to what they intend to do and how they intend to do it.\nQ: And you just mentioned a dual track between healthcare and tax reform, but then there's also infrastructure hanging out there. So can all of those go together?\nMR. SPICER: Lots of tracks. I mean, again, remember they're not all the same people; some of them overlap, some of them don't. But I think part of this is, is that you got to remember that some things can happen sooner than others because of the legislative calendar. Some things are going to take longer because of both the legislative calendar and because of the number of individuals involved and the complexity of the situation. But there's a lot of things that can be moving at once because of how they'll play out.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Turning to the foreign front, yesterday, Vladimir Kara-Murza, the twice-poisoned Russian dissident and vice-chairman of the Open Russia Movement, testified before a Senate appropriations subcommittee, backing continued sanctions against Russia. He also called on Secretary of State Tillerson to meet with Russian civil society members --in other words, anti-Putin dissidents like himself -- when he makes his trip to Moscow next month.\nMr. Kara-Murza also said he was meeting with many members of Congress of both parties, but he would be very happy to meet with any administration officials. Are there any plans for the President or anyone in the White House to meet with Mr. Kara-Murza? And will Mr. Tillerson meet with the Russian civil society?\nMR. SPICER: I would suggest to you -- I'm not aware of anything. Both the National Security Council, as well as the State Department are probably more appropriate for you to address that to.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, can I ask a question -- but before I do, get some clarification on the answer that you gave to Hunter and to Major? I thought it was just yesterday that you said that when you were asked who cleared in Chairman Nunes, that you had asked some preliminary questions and not gotten answers, and that you would continue to ask.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: So my question today is, you know the answers to that and you are saying you will not answer that question today? Or you don't know?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that's not -- right. So what I'm saying to you is, is that the decision that has been made is to bring in all the relevant individuals that are reviewing the situation and make them available; that getting into sources and process is not the proper way to conduct this review. And we want the people who are conducting it to understand more fully the materials -- not necessarily who came in what time and whatever.\nQ: So you're -- just to clarify again, you asked the questions? You were not given answers?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, that's -- I'm just saying that --\nQ: You said yesterday you asked that -- wait, let me finish. You said yesterday that you asked, you didn't get the answers. And so what you're telling us today is you are never going to get the answer -- you, yourself -- you are never going to get the answer to who cleared in Chairman Nunes?\nMR. SPICER: What I'm saying is, is that the decision was made -- it's supposed to focus on the process, to focus on the substance, and that the decision was made --\nQ: You're not answering my question.\nMR. SPICER: I let you ask the question, so let me answer it, please.\nAnd the answer that I'm giving you is that the decision was made internally to focus on the individuals who are doing the review, both Republicans and the Democrats, House and Senate, and have them come in and look at the materials. That's what the focus should be, Alexis.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Wait, wait, wait, here's my bigger question. The President has expressed his affirmation, his support for the finding that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. That is the centerpiece of the investigation at the FBI and the Senate Intelligence Committee. My question is -- can you update us, what is the President doing now in the administration to respond to Director Comey's testimony that that interference is not just election-year-based but continuing?\nMR. SPICER: You're talking about the executive order, is that correct?\nQ: I just asked, can you update what is the administration doing to prevent that, to --\nMR. SPICER: So okay --\nQ: -- to respond to that preliminary finding already, that we already know, that it is continuing?\nMR. SPICER: Well, so the executive order that the President signed that continues the national emergency deals with looking into malicious attempts and cyber attempts to come into the United States. That's what the executive order that he signed was.\nQ: That's the sum total of the response so far?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get into what's being done behind the scenes in terms of the intelligence and law enforcement community. But the bottom line is that there was an emergency declared with respect to challenges that the United States faces from a variety of actors outside the United States to come in and use cyber techniques to hack the United States. The national emergency will continue under the President to address the threats that we face from abroad and from a variety of places.\nApril.\nQ: Sean?\nQ: Wait, no. I was just going to --\nQ: Sean?\nMR. SPICER: April.\nQ: Yes, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: We'll get to you. (Laughter.)\nQ: He called on someone else? I'm sorry. Go ahead, and then come back to me.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, I'll do Kaitlan and then April. I'm sorry.\nQ: She can go first, but I'll just go after her.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: Okay, thank you, Kaitlan. So, Sean, what is the ultimate goal of the leaders coming in to get this information? And will it be information that Nunes received plus? Or will it just be basically a synopsis of a synopsis of what Nunes received?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's going to be the materials that are relevant to the discussion in the area that they're reviewing. And that's up to them to decide the relevancy of that. I think we have, from the National Security Committee, has gone into -- come upon some materials that they want to share with them. It's up to them to make a decision about the relevance of those documents and what they would lead them to believe.\nBut there's two issues here. One, April, is what do they see, and then what do they want to see in addition to that or as a result of those materials. Right? So, in other words, they may see things and say, hey, this is interesting, I wonder if there's a pattern; this is interesting, I want to see more. Or they may come to a conclusion right away.\nBut that's part of the idea of -- to the first part of your question -- in sharing information with them is to allow the members of both of the committees on a bipartisan basis to come in to review materials that we think are relevant to the issues that the President talked about with respect to surveillance, the masking -- unmasking of individuals, the handling of it, et cetera, et cetera. And then it's up to those members to decide what to do with that information, how to explore that more in depth.\nQ: So, ultimately, in their questioning, they could actually wind up reviewing what Nunes received, possibly? If they do, even ask different questions, just sitting in the intelligence meetings like the President does -- if he decides to give more he'll give more?\nMR. SPICER: It depends. I think that's possible. I don't want to prejudge what they ask and what comes in response to it. It also has to do with what documents we have. They may go down a particular trail and have to follow up with an agency and say, we saw this, can we see a follow-up on that. As you saw from many reports the NSA has been asked to provide documentation to the House. My understanding from the reports is that that was ongoing. And maybe some of the materials that they see prompt them to ask additional questions.\nBut that's part of providing it to them. It's an ongoing review. And what we want is for them to see these materials and come to conclusions, or need more information to come to conclusions. But this is part of that review process.\nQ: Are they allowed to -- the type of briefing, with their ranking and who they are -- no matter if they may be head of the Intel Committee, are some of these other members allowed to see the same things that he sees? Even though they are not head of -- I mean, are they allowed to see that?\nMR. SPICER: My understanding would be that they would.\nQ: Okay. And lastly, Sean, do you know who allowed him to come in?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: You don't know?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nKaitlan.\nQ: I have two questions for you. One is did anyone in the White House ever raise the possibility of a Cabinet position or a top intelligence post later on in the administration for Devin Nunes?\nMR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware.\nQ: And secondly, will the President hold a press conference so he can answer questions on the surveillance claims and all these intelligence revelations himself?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not good enough?\nQ: Not that you're not good enough, but he's the one who made the claims. You didn't make the claims, he made the claims.\nMR. SPICER: I will convey your request to him. I know that as I've said before, we'll see. I'm sure that at some point -- he enjoyed the last one so much --\nQ: Tomorrow?\nMR. SPICER: Is that what you'd like, tomorrow?\nQ: That works.\nMR. SPICER: Does that work for you? (Laughter.) Okay, well, let me see what I can come up with.\nCecilia.\nQ: I just want to clarify, do you believe -- from what you know about these materials, do they validate the President's wiretapped claim?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I have not seen the materials. It is members of the National Security Committee who have come across these documents that want to make them available to the members who are leading the review.\nQ: And why not just be more forthcoming about this entire process of who let Nunes in? If this was enough -- if the President of the United States could tweet this claim about wiretapping, doesn't the American public have a right to know more?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, they do. And I think that's why we're going through a process. And I say this respectfully -- I understand that you want all the process answers -- what day did they come in, what were they wearing, what door did they come in. The relevant questions are about the substance of this. And it's interesting -- I don't get the same thing when I see these unpublished stories with anonymous sources. You don't ever tell me who your sources were, who --\nQ: Because you're --\nMR. SPICER: Glenn, I'm actually asking Cecilia's question -- if you could be as polite as not to interrupt her.\nQ: I'm sorry.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nDo you accept his apology?\nQ: One hundred percent. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: That's very --\nQ: In fact, I will cede the floor to Glenn.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. That's not how it works, though.\nBut I would argue that you guys have -- when you write a story, and you call and say, I have four anonymous sources that say whatever, and I say, okay, well, who are the sources and where are they coming -- you go, sorry, I'm not revealing anything to you, but the substance that I'm asking you to respond to -- well, when the shoe is on the other foot you're all about the process.\nThe bottom line is that there are two congressional committees that are conducting reviews of this situation, and those committees are looking at the relevant information and talking to the relevant people.\nTo your point about the process, we have made individuals available and encouraged individuals to testify or to meet with or to discuss that have been approached. So I think that what we are doing is frankly -- and I know you probably disagree, but I think we are doing the responsible thing by making sure that documents and materials are shown to people with the appropriate classifications in the appropriate settings, and that the people that the different committees would like to discuss these matters with are made available to them. I think that's the responsible way of handling this.\nQ: Sean, thank you very much. I have two questions, one on Venezuela and another one on climate policy. With respect to Venezuela, because today the Supreme Court of Venezuela said they would take -- try to take over the Congress powers and the opposition said a coup is underway. Do you consider there is a coup underway in Venezuela, and what can we expect the United States to do?\nAnd the other question is on climate change, because President Obama signed also the bilateral climate deals with Brazil, China and India. And what do you have to those?\nMR. SPICER: Well, on the first one, respectfully, I would send you to the -- I would refer you to the State Department. The only Supreme Court I'm really focused on right now is ours and getting Judge Neil Gorsuch confirmed by the Senate. So I'd be glad -- I think the State Department is more of an appropriate venue to discuss the activities over there.\nAnd second, I think when it comes to things like the Paris treaty, as I mentioned at the outset, that is being --\nQ: Those are separate --\nMR. SPICER: I understand, but I think that there are things that we will have updates for on all of these things as we move forward. Right now, I've got nothing on that subject.\nYes.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that the Trump administration is proposing more modest changes to NAFTA. Like, for example, they're leaving the arbitration panel that deals with trade disputes in place, et cetera, et cetera. Is the White House backing away from some of the more sweeping changes to NAFTA that the President proposed during the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: I would just argue that Robert Lighthizer isn't even nominated yet. That is not a statement of administration policy at this point. There is nothing in those documents that we are confirming -- or in that report, rather, that we are confirming. That is not a statement of administration policy. That is not an accurate assessment of where we are at this time.\nAnd I think our goal is to get Robert Lighthizer appointed as the next ambassador and U.S. Trade Representative, and then when we have that we will have plenty of updates on where we go with respect to NAFTA and the rest of our trade agreement.\nWith that, I'm going to say goodbye. I will see you tomorrow. Thank you -- oh, I'm sorry, I promised two days in a row.\nQ: Thank you. I've got one on foreign policy and one on domestic policy. First one is, many Republicans were very critical about how President Obama had handled the Iranian Green Revolution about six years ago. So my question is, if mass protests across Russia develop into a movement, is this something that -- what does the administration feel its role should be regarding that?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- that's a hypothetical question to talk about what would happen and if --\nQ: No, it's not --\nMR. SPICER: I know, but when it comes to protests we obviously encourage, as we did last Sunday, the peaceful protest -- the government of Russia to allow the peaceful protest of individuals throughout their country. We obviously support the people to have a voice in every government throughout the world.\nQ: And on the subject of partisanship and obstructionism, whose responsibility does the President feel it is to put an end to partisanship? And who needs to be reaching out to whom collectively?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's a two-way street. I think part of it is that we -- the President and the First Lady extended an invitation the other night for everyone to come. I think we were excited to see a third of Senate Democrats come. I wish we had seen more. There's an opportunity I think to engage in a discussion about some of the issues and come together.\nBut I would argue that when you look at this fight on Gorsuch, there are -- I don't disagree with the fact that if you're a Democrat you probably don't necessarily agree with some of the rulings and some of the philosophies of Judge Gorsuch. I get that. But at the end of the day, they have always agreed -- in fact, in most cases, the filibuster has never been the norm. It hasn't. And it is odd to see that these individuals who have -- it's one thing to vote no; it's one thing to say that we don't agree. But to now turn to filibustering or threatening to filibuster Senate -- unbelievably qualified people, and there is nobody that I'm aware of, even on the left, that is suggesting that Judge Gorsuch isn't qualified to serve as a Supreme Court justice.\nRepublicans in the past have allowed Democrat Presidents to have their nominees voted on up or down, and for the most part, when you go back to President Obama, President Clinton, they have been -- Republicans have joined with Democrats to allow people who are qualified to go onto the Court. And to see this new precedent be formed by Leader Schumer is disappointing because this is a huge, huge crack. I think there was a column -- one of the papers today I think -- you are really fundamentally changing how the Senate is going to operate by doing this.\nAnd I think that's an important -- they can disagree with him philosophically, I get that. But when you have an election you can assume that a Republican President is going to choose Republicans for appointments and for federal judgeships, and the Democrats will do the same with their time in office.\nBut it was Obama's nominees that got through, all with Republican support. And it's difficult to understand why when you've got someone as eminently qualified as Gorsuch, that this is the state that they want to drive. And I think it further sets a partisan divide in our country when we can't allow people who are qualified and universally so to get on the bench.\nQ: Should it not be done from the President's side to try to --\nMR. SPICER: I think so, sure. But I think it's a two-way street. I would ask you what is -- I remember a few years ago there was all this talk about, from the get-go, of Obama -- Democrats [sic] made hay about how they wanted to see him as a one-term President. I've seen a similar tactic from Democrats now about how they want to defeat him, they want to stop his agenda, and there's no sense of them wanting to work with this President.\nSo at some point, I think we have shown a willingness to bring them together. It's amazing how many senators, when you talk to them over the course of the last almost 70 days, have said, you know, I've been to the White House more in the last 70 days of a Trump administration than I was during eight years of an Obama administration. And I think that that speaks to the President's desire to bring people together and to find common ground on areas of mutual agreement where we can move the country forward.\nThank you. I'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:37 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-30", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123696", "text": "James S. Brady Briefing Room\n2:50 P.M. EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to continue kind of moving on a quick pace, because we do have -- we've got multiple events happening today, and we got a hard stop today at 3:15 for this. So I'm going to be very brief. Just a couple of ground rules for this. This is going to be a background briefing on the release of the financial disclosure forms. That will happen later today. The embargo for this briefing is 5:00 p.m.\nI would like to introduce two individuals, and they can give you their full titles when they come up here. But [senior administration officials] are with the White House Counsel's Office. What they're going to do is walk you through the process, exactly what these individuals had to go through, and give you kind of a broad brush of what you will see once these records are released later on this evening. And, hopefully, if you can keep your questions to the process, I think we'll be able to get through this more quickly and with more useful information.\nBut with that, let me introduce [senior administration officials]. If you'd like to take the podium.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks very much. We've both been working pretty hard for a while on putting together the financial disclosures that are going to be made available online this afternoon and this evening. And so we thought what we'd do now is take an opportunity to walk through both what it is that you're going to be seeing, what it represents, and also how it fits into the process so that as you're analyzing the financial disclosures, you have a sense of what it is that you're looking at, where we have gone from the time when we've received the information that we're releasing, how this process continues going forward and gives you the opportunity to ask the kind of questions, and doing it in a way that is based on the facts and what it is that we have.\nSo what I want to make sure that we're talking about is that everyone understands how the information that you have, that we're going to be releasing this afternoon is developed. And just a process point at the outset: We're going to be putting live, later this afternoon, on our website the ability the enter a form -- it's called a 201 form, which is a legally required form that, if you're requesting financial information, you say what your name is, you identify a little bit of information and your email address, who it is that you're seeking financial information on, you enter that. And then later this afternoon or this evening, we're going to be sending out to everybody who went online this afternoon and asked for a specific person, we're going to actually send you the PDF of the full 278 form as we have it in the current form, which is going to then give you the opportunity to follow up with the press office as to any additional questions. But we want to make sure that you understand what it is that you're seeing.\nAnd the other piece that I want to make sure that we're talking about is to understand that the documents that you're going to be seeing, which are comprehensive financial disclosure documents that talk through salaries, assets, commonly held assets with spouses -- it's a very comprehensive set of documentation. Understand that the documents, though, that you're going to be seeing, which are going to be listing lots of assets and lots of holdings, are going to be the starting point, the documents that we receive -- as people come into government, they would fill out this form, and they would identify all of their assets and all of their information.\nThis is then the information that we -- and my colleague is going to talk through it, because he's really been taking the laboring more on meeting with every single one of our commissioned officers, talking through how we handle the issues, talking about what potential conflict of interest there might be, and then helping everyone work through what the ethics agreements are going to be as folks have been migrating through the process.\nBut understand that when you see lots of assets on these forms, these are not the current holdings that everyone has today. These are the holdings that everybody had at the time when they came into office. So you're going to see a lot of people that are holding a lot of assets that one would say, well, gee, isn't a conflict of interest if this person has this asset today, what are we supposed to make of that? And we want to make sure that everyone is cautioned here against simply writing a story that says, \"This person holds this today, there must be a conflict of interest.\"\nThis, as I said, the starting process is we looked at this information as it came into us. It's the basis that we used, then, to have a sit-down meeting with every single one of the public filers. The public filers is every single commissioned officer and every single civilian White House employee who is making over $161,755. So every commissioned officer and everyone who is making above that is a public filing disclosure, and is going to be subject to your inquiry.\nAnd so what we did is, once we identified this information, sat down with them, said, look, we have identified these assets, there's a process now to how you're going to be divesting yourself; you can't hold this asset and do the job that you're tasked with doing here, how are we going to go through the process of selling it? And there's a very sort of complex process of getting what's called a certificate of divestiture -- and my colleague can talk through a little bit about that.\nAlso, there's a lot of information that the Office of Government Ethics puts out. They actually put out a very hand document that we have some copies of, of what the certificate of divestiture process works with. We hand this out to our folks to say, before you can sell the asset that might be a conflict, you have to work with us and the Office of Government Ethics to make sure that we've gotten the proper certificates before you unwind the assets.\nAnd so that entire process is what we're going to turn over, and I'm going to let my colleague speak to. But there's one or two other just points that I wanted to speak to, the first of which is I want to highlight the incredible complexity and the sophistication of the assets and the financial structures that this White House is going to present.\nThese are incredibly successful individuals, very high net worth, very sophisticated, complex asset structures, numerous sub-LLCs, trusts and other items, all of which have to be worked through. Very helpfully, the Office of Government Ethics prepared a report analyzing the sophistication of this incoming White House versus the preceding administration, and they created a fairly helpful document. We've got some copies of it for you that's, again, created by the Office of Government Ethics that talks through -- under the Obama administration these were simple ones, moderately difficult, complex. And for those who are fans of \"Spinal Tap,\" these were the \"elevens\" out of ten on the scale. And you can see how the complexity relates from the folks that were in the previous administration to the complexity that we've been dealing with here.\nAnd I would invite anyone to go from this to make sure you're also talking to the Office of Government Ethics if you want full sort of feedback on what the nature is of how this process works. They're going to talk to the sophistication and the complexity of what we're doing.\nThey're also going to tell you that this is a process that it is very common, extraordinarily common, for there to be changes even from here going forward as we work through with people making sure we're characterizing the documents properly, and that it's not at all unusual if you see something that you download today, and that, 20 days from now, there might be a minor change to it -- you're going to get to see those things, but that that's not going to be an indicator that maybe something was amiss or that someone was hiding something.\nAnd I'd refer you to the Office of Government Ethics. I think they're going to be pretty happy to share that with you.\nBefore I turn it over to my colleague, I wanted to do one other thing, just to talk about how the timeline here all works. As somebody comes into the administration, they have 30 days to fill out this form. So the documents that you're going to be seeing are the documents that were filled out by people within 30 days. They're entitled to two 45-day extensions. We had very few of those. Everybody who was there on the first day has the 278s originally filed and into us.\nFrom the time that the person files, we in the Office of the White House Counsel have another 30 days to really look through and review all of these documents before the public has the opportunity to request these documents. That's pretty much where we are now for folks who started at the beginning.\nI did a little bit of research to see when the preceding administration did their sort of release of everyone. I think I found some Washington Post articles from April 3rd, 2009, saying last night on a Friday the White House released all this information. So we'd point out today is the 31st, a little earlier than the April the 3rd.\nAnd what happens then with respect to our most senior filers -- the assistants to the President, deputy assistants to the President -- is there's actually an additional review process that happens with the Office of Government Ethics. That is going to be an ongoing process. We are going to continue working with them as they will then review and then provide feedback to us, and they can talk about how that works.\nSo again, this is an ongoing process. The documents you're going to be seeing are a snapshot in time -- an entry snapshot in time. And we want to make sure that everyone understood what it is that you're looking at.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, who can talk through sort of the process that he went through.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. So this all started prior to day one for most folks in the administration that had been appointed to the White House, where, day one, they begin filling out these forms. And a lot of folks started working directly with OGE, the incoming White House Counsel staff. And then post-day one, we assisted all of the commissioned officers with preparing the reports. And that takes some time.\nAs the reports get complete, we have to make sure they're accurate, they have to be submitted by each individual filer. They have to certify that they're accurate to the best of their knowledge. We assist them through the process to make sure that it's clearly -- the assets are clearly delineated in the particular forms.\nAnd at that time, we start counseling immediately, because the ethics laws apply day one. And we begin counseling immediately as to potential conflicts, what they should be recusing themselves from, what they should consider divesting from, and what they need to resign from. And those are kind of the three components. It's resign, divest, and then recuse, in that order.\nSo folks who were in other jobs or other positions, so to speak -- and it doesn't even mean paid positions -- have to resign from those positions prior to beginning government service, and everyone did. In the case of, I think, two very good examples that I'm going to use today -- Gary Cohn and Jared Kushner -- for instance, Jared Kushner had 266 positions that he had to resign from. He began early on in January, maybe even prior to January, in starting to prepare to get into this process. Gary Cohn did the same thing. He resigned from all his positions immediately and worked through it.\nThe divestiture part pertains to assets. So that relates to assets that they may be involved in. Obviously Kushner had a number of different assets with a number of different companies; he's in the process or has divested and has divested from most of those that may have created a conflict of interest coming into this job.\nNow, both of those individuals had very broad responsibilities, so it's very important that we're in tune to the fact that these broad responsibilities -- and we are recusing from the issues that they need to recuse from -- but divestiture is the most important thing. And Gary Cohn, within 90 days, for his liquidated stocks, interests, and within 120 days for his Goldman Sachs interest will be fully divested. And he's far ahead of that process now.\nAs that process goes on, we move to the ethics agreement portion of it. Every single commissioned officer in this administration will have an ethics agreement. That means it's an agreement that the White House Counsel's Office and the individual has agreed upon what they're going to divest, what they're going to recuse from, and that will all be delineated in writing, so it's very clear as to what they need to do going forward to be both in compliance with the ethics laws and the pledge -- the ethics pledge.\nSo that's kind of the process that we go through. At this stage, everyone has filed -- that started day one, January 20th -- everyone has filed. We are in the process -- some have ethics agreements that's are prepared, some don't. We've counseled everyone. I've sat with every assistant to the President and given them personal counseling. I've been managing a team of lawyers -- because I think it's roughly 180 folks that have come through the process -- a team of lawyers who have been meeting both on phone calls and in person with each one of the commissioned officers in this administration.\nSo that's kind of a flavor for it. In terms of divestiture, I talked a little bit about Gary and Jared. And another person -- another good example is Reince. He was a lawyer and worked at the RNC; he resigned from the RNC, resigned from his law firm. But not only that, he divested from his interest in his law firm. And that is a story that's told all the way across the board with this administration, because it's so important that we're able to -- that they're able to do their jobs conflict-free.\nQ: What happened in the very few instances where a person may have started the process but is no longer with the White House? Are those documents --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, so we have a number of individuals who started. Some of them filed; some of them didn't. The ones who have filed, some of them are going to be certified and some of them aren't because it depends how much activity that we had throughout the process and when they resigned or when they left the administration. So there are a few that will be uncertified but will be publicly available.\nQ: Can you talk about whether you've issued any ethics waivers? Is everybody who had a prior relationship with some company or entity recusing themselves? Or are there some instances where you've gone ahead and accepted that there's going to be some conflict?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Waivers are only issued in very limited instances. And I'm going to talk about process right now.\nSo, for instance, if we have folks who -- and I want to step back and talk a little bit about divestiture. So part of the process -- and it's important that we get started with that process early in divestiture -- is to work with OGE to get what's called -- my colleague talked about it -- a certificate of divestiture.\nThe certificate of divestiture allows for deferred tax treatment because you're selling off assets and it defers to the capital gains if you reinvest the money back into exempted funds, which a '40 Act regulated mutual fund is a good example of that. So that takes some time.\nSo there are -- the first thing that happens is the filer makes a request to the White House Counsel's Office, or the ethics official that will then make a request to OGE for a certificate of divestiture for all of the stocks they're divesting from.\nIf there's a conflict that you can't recuse from -- in limited instances it may make sense to issue waivers where the conflict is so remote, where there's a de minimis issue. There's a number of different circumstances where you have trusts that don't necessarily involve the particular individual. And those instances it makes sense -- and it's done in consult with OGE -- waivers will be issued.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, and I just want to add one other point that goes along with that. Because it's a very particularized process of selling these assets, and you don't get the divestiture -- the tax benefit for doing it if you do it incorrectly -- there are a lot of individuals who might have been ready to sell their assets, but because we had to make sure we're walking them through, get these signed off and these actually issued by the Office of Government Ethics, there are some people who are in the process of still unwinding their assets. And we've had a lot of sort of questions about that.\nQ: But if I could just follow up on that, what about if you're not talking about assets, you're talking about a prior affiliation with a large entity like Goldman Sachs or Breitbart, hypothetically? Do you have to take some action to waive any potential impact they may have in their decisions on that entity, even if they're completely divested from assets related?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So we'll talk about Gary Cohn, because I started talking about him earlier, and you mentioned Goldman Sachs.\nIn that instance where Goldman Sachs is implicated -- he worked for Goldman Sachs -- it's a two-year ban on dealing with specific matters -- particular matters with specific parties. And for general matters relative to general applicability, he would be able to impact matters -- like, Gary is on the Economic Council, for instance, so he's not going to be recused from handling anything that may impact Goldman Sachs from a policy perspective. That's what he's here to do is impact the economic policy.\nIn this instance, he would not be meeting with Goldman Sachs as part of his ethics agreement, relative to specific matters.\nQ: Can I just ask a couple logistical questions about today? Anita Kumar, from McClatchy. You mentioned 180. Is that what's available today, 180 people -- reports?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Just about. There are some that -- because there was this process that some of the folks were able to sort of file a little bit late, I believe, though, that virtually everyone -- and I think almost all of the senior folks are all sufficiently through that process. There might be some people who we haven't certified yet but who we are making available.\nQ: So just a handful? That won't be another day of another thing like this? It will just be --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, no, no, this is going to be the vast majority.\nQ: You mentioned this afternoon and you mentioned this evening. Can you tell us the times? And what does that mean exactly?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. And I'm not positive exactly when the time was, but sometime this afternoon, later this afternoon, 3:30 p.m., 4:30 p.m., 5:00 p.m. -- something like that -- up on our website is going to go live the link that allows you to fill out the request form. It's a five --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Five-part.\nQ: And so we should just look for it? Or we'll get an email?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Probably look for it, I guess.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Check on the White House webpage.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, yes, it will be -- it won't be hidden.\nQ: Okay, we request whatever?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, so you fill out this form and you say, I would like to see the financial disclosure forms for -- and then pick whoever it is. Anyone who has filled that thing out, we're going to be sending out tonight the --\nQ: What time tonight?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We'll probably collect them -- because we're not going to do them piecemeal. So tonight probably around 7:00, we'll have a team of folks kind of emailing out to -- for instance, if 25 people in this room asked for Gary Cohn's -- which I'm sure everyone in this room is going to ask for -- Gary Cohn's financial disclosure, we will have someone that's charged with putting that into an email and sending to everyone who requested it.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: But we're going to be sending mass --\nQ: One last thing, for those of us who don't have the 180 names just on our computers here ready to ask you for all 180, is there a list of the 180 that would be available roughly?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know that there is a list of White House staff available.\nQ: So you have to make 180 requests?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, and that's required by the form in terms of --\nQ: But do you have to make 180 requests for 180 names, but you're not going to give us the names? We could sit here and go look them up, but can you not provide that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know that I can. Certainly I don't know that I have that list.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we're not -- we're following the instructions and the guidelines, and following along the way the Obama administration --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No different than what they did.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: -- what the Obama administration did. We're doing it exactly the same way, exactly the same manner.\nQ: Okay, that's not -- you do lots of things differently than the Obama administration (inaudible) about every day. So don't rely on the Obama administration.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Actually, no, no, you're absolutely right. You know what we did differently? We're actually ahead of schedule. So the Obama administration released these items on April 3rd, and we're now March 31st. So we are different.\nQ: Two questions for you. One is, now that you've finished up doing this round, can you tell us how many billionaires work in this administration? (Laughter.)\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are lot of different ways to look at assets. We're going to make -- it's all going to be clear. It's going to be assets, it's going to be --\nQ: (Inaudible) personal net worth over $1 billion?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know the statistic number on that. You're going to have that available to you tonight.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's all going to be available, yes.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And I'm sure you know the names to have request.\nQ: Are we going to see a financial disclosure separately from Ivanka Trump, who I guess has just taken a staff job just this week?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, not today. She literally two days ago started the process. She has 30 days to even fill in the form. Jared will be there.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The good news about that is, is that for purposes of Jared Kushner, all of her assets are imputed to him, so there's not going to be any surprises.\nQ: -- forms from the President and Vice President?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, it's a separate form. I believe it's May 15th, but I don't know that for sure. It's legally required. I know I've seen some press reporting. I don't know the decision has been made whether on May 15th -- because it's not required if he's going to do it. But that's a different --\nQ: How many ethics letters have you sent out? And when will they be available for us to review?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ethics agreements you mean? Is that what you're speaking of? Ethics agreements are presidential records. They're internal documents; always have been.\nQ: So we won't see those?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, correct.\nQ: Post the waivers like the administration did?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, the document he's talking about, the ethics agreement, every single employee has an agreement that we enter -- here's what you're going to be doing to run through it. I think we're good.\nQ: A separate question actually. You said there are going to be assets listed that they may not have divested from, correct? So how will we know if we look at a form if there's a series of assets listed what they have divested from? And is there some kind of update form that they then have to file?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You're going to have ask the questions.\nQ: So we have to then go through it and say, okay, Jared has X, Y, Z -- or whoever?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: But also, it's a continuing process, too. People continue to file. Like every year there are going to be some -- this isn't the only time that people file this.\nQ: No, no, I get that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: To the extent assets are sold off after folks are employees of the government, a 278-T will be filed at that point within a certain amount of time that says -- that's a separate form. But some of these folks, like I said, divested before they came in.\nQ: With the waiver -- let me ask the question on waivers. Are you guys going to make available the waivers so we can see those?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: 208 waivers relative to the ethics -- relative to the Ethics Act are, by law, required to be available publicly.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, and we will do that.\nQ: We get those through the same request process? Or you're just going to post them like the previous ethics waivers?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know the answer.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're going to have to discuss that. I think that's a great question that we actually, when we were talking about this earlier -- we'll come up with a policy on that.\nSo to be clear --\nQ: Wait -- (inaudible) --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: no, no, no, I'm -- we're good.\nQ: (Inaudible.) I understand. But we do have a hard stop here.\nQ: These are really good questions. (Laughter.)\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Actually, all of you had really good questions. But the most important part is, when you do have questions -- further questions on this -- please direct those questions to the press office. We will work with either -- with the lawyers, and find who has the exact answer for you.\nBut the best way for you to do this is to go through the press office rather than --\nQ: Who's on point in the press office?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's who wasn't nice to me today. Yes. And so please go through the press office. Because if you go to the individuals directly, all they're going to do is come back to us.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There was a question about Ivanka -- so Ivanka Trump is a commissioned officer who does have to file -- even without the salary, will be filing a 278 form. But as my colleague has said, as part of the 278 that you're going to see on Jared Kushner, it lists all of the assets, including all of her assets. You're going to see a massive portion of already what's in there. The only thing that's not is a unique small piece relating to her, which she will do. She is a commissioned officer, so she will be a public filer. You will get hers. She just hasn't even filed it. She's an employee as of two days ago.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right, thank you very much, guys.\nEND 3:16 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123697", "text": "James S. Brady Briefing Room\n10:29 A.M. EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning. I'd like to welcome everybody who's here and everybody who's dialed into our morning NSC backgrounder on the upcoming Egypt and Jordan visits.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're going to address two topics that are coming up. One, next week, we've got President Sisi coming in on the third of April, and we've got King Abdullah coming in for a White House visit on 5 April.\nTo begin with, I will make a few comments about the President Sisi visit.\nThe President is excited to welcome Egyptian President al-Sisi to the White House on 3 April. And he wants to use President Sisi's visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two Presidents established when they first met in New York last September.\nEgypt is one of the traditional pillars of stability in the Middle East and has been a reliable U.S. partner for decades. President Trump's initial interactions with President al-Sisi, including their phone call on January 23rd, have already improved the tone of the relationship, and we hope next week's visit continues this positive momentum.\nPresident Trump aims to reaffirm the deep and abiding U.S. commitment to Egypt's security, stability and prosperity. President Sisi has taken a number of bold steps on very sensitive issues since becoming President in 2014. He's called for reform and moderation of Islamic discourse, initiated courageous and historic economic reforms, and sought to reestablish Egypt's regional leadership role.\nHe has also led Egypt's campaign to defeat a long-running terrorist threat in the Sinai. The United States wants to support President al-Sisi's efforts in all of these areas. Our relationship has historically been driven by security, and that will remain a key component of the engagement with Egypt. The U.S. and Egyptian militaries have built close relationships, and many military officers from Egypt have trained at U.S. military installations.\nPresident Trump also supports al-Sisi's ambition to develop a comprehensive counterterrorism approach that involves military, political, economic, as well as social efforts. But President Trump also wants to increase the focus on economic and commercial cooperation in our bilateral relationship. Building a more stable and productive economy is a critical step to ensuring long-term stability in Egypt. And President Sisi, we would like to note, has begun a necessary economic reform plan that will strengthen the Egyptian economy if it is fully executed.\nThere's no question the transition in their economy will be difficult, but in the long run, Egypt will be stronger if it follows through on its homegrown reform plan. Our relationship with Egypt is complex and covers a number of very challenging issues, and we're fully aware that next week's meeting is only the start of a long process of improving this historical relationship.\nWe are optimistic that we are heading in the right direction, and President Trump is very much looking forward to the visit.\nNow, just a few comments on the visit of King Abdullah. The President is pleased to welcome King Abdullah on April 5th. The two leaders will gather for a meeting in the Oval Office and then proceed to a working lunch. Jordan is a key partner for the United States in the region, and we anticipate the two leaders will discuss a range of shared priorities, including efforts to defeat ISIS, how to end the conflict in Syria, and advancing progress between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nThe President met with King Abdullah briefly on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast in February, and at that time the two agreed on this follow-on meeting. It was important to the President that he welcome King Abdullah to the White House early in his administration as a sign of the strong friendship and partnership. Of utmost importance, this is an opportunity for the President to convey his continued support for our steadfast partnership with Jordan on a range of key regional issues.\nAnd as the President has said, we'll work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish ISIS. Jordan is a critical partner in that effort and it plays an outsized role in this effort as well as in the region.\nAnd with that, that concludes our opening comments.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And again, I'd like to thank everyone for being here. And I'd just like to remind everyone that we have these two gentlemen who are national security policy experts. This backgrounder's purpose is to provide answers to you on issues relating to these two topics -- the upcoming visits and the relationships with these two countries.\nSo please, respectfully, pitch your questions that way. Also, at your request, you can expect that when we're done here we have a one-page written backgrounder that will be submitted on both countries to you guys. So please stick around after this to receive that.\nQ: Is the President expected to provide major financial assistance to the Egyptians? And will he bring up the issue of a human rights crackdown?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We've had a longstanding relationship with substantial foreign military assistance and economic support. That support has continued, and we anticipate it will continue until the future.\nWe're in the budget process right now, and those discussions are ongoing as to how it will be broken out. But we are going to maintain a strong and sufficient level of support to Egypt and Jordan.\nQ: And the human rights crackdown? Will the President bring that up with al-Sisi?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Human rights are always an issue of concern to the United States, and they're first and foremost in our discussions. Our approach is to handle these types of sensitive issues in a private, more discreet way. And we believe it's the most effective way to advance those issues to a favorable outcome.\nQ: Do you anticipate a conversation with King Abdullah about the refugees that the Jordanians have taken in and any sort of help that the Americans would provide in terms of financial support or aid to those refugees since we have slowed down our refugee program to the U.S.?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The United States and the international community are fully engaged in providing support to Jordan for those refugees that are within Jordan and those camps, as well as providing assistance to refugees that are on the Syrian side of the border, which is a difficult situation. And we're working with Jordan to make sure that their interests are taken into account, as well as making sure -- in collaboration with the international community that the needs of those refugees on the other side of the border are fully addressed.\nQ: Quick follow-up. Do you anticipate a conversation about Syrian safe zones around the border region right there? Obviously the Jordanians may be involved in the making of the safe zones.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: The issue of what we would call interim de-escalation areas, rather than safe zones, is one that is a consistent part of our dialogue with Jordan as well as others that are involved in -- whether it's the Geneva talks that are focused on resolving the Syrian conflict, or in a bilateral way in trying to develop options to provide security, safety, and humanitarian access for displaced people, whether they're internally displaced in the country or fostering an environment where external refugees can return to their home country.\nQ: Two questions regarding President al-Sisi's visit. Will the President be discussing with President al-Sisi any issues concerning the Egypt-Russia relationship and Russia's attempts to rekindle that relationship as Egypt has moved closer to the U.S.? And related to that, is the decision or choice to downplay or take privately the human rights issues out of any desire to not want to alienate President Sisi and then drive him closer to Russia?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: So on the Russia question, I would say the United States is going to talk with Egypt about any number of regional and international issues. Russia is obviously a country that is interested and involved in Egypt. The nature of those discussions, I don't want to get ahead of that or say what it will be, but there will be a number of regional and international topics that are discussed.\nQ: And the human rights issue?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: So I wouldn't look at it as -- I wouldn't read too much into it, the public or private nature of it. These are issues that are important. Human rights has been an area we've talked about with Egypt for a number of years, and we will figure out the best way to discuss that, to handle that.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: We've always done that in a number of ways.\nQ: Two questions. Has there been by the administration any decision -- I know there has been some consideration of designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, if there's talk of it -- where has that conversation ended? I imagine that will come up with at least Sisi, if not both leaders. And on the issue of Egypt, Aya Hijazi, the American who continues to be detained there, will her case be specifically brought up?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: So the President is interested in hearing President al-Sisi's views on the Muslim Brotherhood issue. Obviously that is one that has received a lot of attention. We, along with a number of countries, have some concerns about various activities that the Muslim Brotherhood has conducted in the region. But that's going to be a discussion that will unfold between us and Egypt.\nQ: No decision by the administration yet?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I don't want to get ahead of any process bilaterally or internally on that issue. But it is something that we will likely be discussing with Egypt.\nQ: And so is it safe to say then that that conversation continues within the administration?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I think it's safe to say that that, along with a number of issues about how we engage with Egypt, continues in the administration.\nQ: And on Hijazi?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: On Hijazi, so, of course, we're very aware of her case. The most senior levels of the administration understand her situation. The protection of U.S. citizens in Egypt and around the world is one of the highest priorities for the President and for the administration. We are going to address this with Egypt in a way that we think maximizes the chances her case will be resolved in a satisfactory manner.\nQ: So not directly with Sisi?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: We will figure out the best way the raise this with the Egyptian government to maximize the chances her case is resolved positively.\nQ: Any reaction -- I know it's a background briefing -- to this decision to allow new settlements in the Occupied West Bank? And is this something that the President -- how will the President bring this up particularly with King Abdullah next week?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I think the discussion about the settlements is not one that we want to address at this time. My office is deeply involved in that effort and working with both the Israelis and the Palestinians on that issue. But we do not anticipate that becoming a focal point for any discussions over the next week.\nQ: But you did say that the Israeli-Palestinian topic would be generally a matter of discussion. So, if not settlements, what's the discussion?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: We are not going to, in this forum, get into the specifics of the points that we're going to be bringing up. But we are going to be discussing the general outlines of our approach with the Middle East peace process and provide information as to the context of what we've been doing over the last few weeks to advance the process.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I know there's going to be a lot of interest in the topic that has just been brought up. I would urge you to -- that there is a forum coming up here shortly, in a few hours here, where that will be -- you can address that more directly.\nGo ahead.\nQ: There's reports in the Egyptian media that President Sisi will bring with him a list of Egyptians that he would like the Trump administration to extradite to Egypt. Is that something the President would be open to?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think it's hard to comment on something just based on reports in the Egyptian press. If that is conveyed, we can talk with the Egyptians about it. But we're not aware of any request coming, so I wouldn't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.\nQ: And he's also interested in changing some of the rules on the cash flow of the aid to reverse what President Obama had done.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Cash-flow financing.\nQ: Right. Is that something that Trump is open to?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So again, security cooperation is going to be something we talk about. There are a number of ways that we can try and improve and enhance security cooperation. U.S. foreign military financing had traditionally been $1.3 billion a year. That's a very large amount, and that has contributed to Egypt's military preparedness.\nThe nature -- the way we deliver that assistance is something that has always been a topic of discussion and will remain that. We'll discuss with Egypt whether cash-flow financing is something they need or not, but it is also something that would be a process of our internal budget discussions that are ongoing. So we can't really get ahead of the budget planning now.\nQ: There have been some discussions over the last couple of days about whether the U.S. government position on Assad in Syria is that he has to leave power. What is the current position of this White House? And how do you expect that to be discussed during these meetings?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We are not going to address that issue at this forum. That issue will be addressed, I'm sure, later in the day or in the very near future. We've worked on that communication, and it will be coming out, as I said, in the near future.\nQ: So does the Secretary of State's comment still stand?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not going to address any of those issues.\nQ: You said earlier that you anticipate the United States will continue to provide substantial foreign and military assistance to Egypt. The State Department has said that Egypt is one of the countries that would be impacted by the President's cuts to foreign aid in his budget. Can you just clarify that? Is that something that they are likely to talk about in their meeting? Is that something that the White House is looking at? And if so, how much would be slashed?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The administration wants to fully support the needs and requirements, and sustain the relationship in a very effective way. The discussions about the details of the budget process and how that's going to be allocated with the input from the Department of State is still an ongoing process.\nQ: Had the Prime Minister expressed any concern about that ahead of this visit, or any hope to address that in their meeting?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You mean President al-Sisi?\nQ: I'm sorry, President.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So the Egyptians have consistently made clear that the security assistance is important and it has been for us. I anticipate that will be a topic of discussion with the Egyptians. What details we get into exactly, I can't get ahead of that. But I'm sure the Egyptians will want to sustain a strong security assistance relationship.\nQ: Several weeks ago, the Pentagon submitted a plan for defeating ISIS to President Trump. Can you say how far along he is in reviewing that plan? And do the contents of that, do you expect those to come up in the meetings with either of these two leaders?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We'll have discussions with both leaders about our approach to defeating ISIS. It will surely be of interest to President Sisi and, of course, King Abdullah. The details about any progress in the plan we would defer to another time.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I understand that you will have an event here in about four minutes, so we're going to wrap up to facilitate you making to it. But please, if you would just stay around, we'll get those backgrounders to you.\nI'd like to thank everyone who participated in the room and on the phone, and just remind any latecomers that this is a backgrounder, attribution to senior White House officials, and that the information here is embargoed until 11:30 a.m.\nThank very much for being here.\nEND 10:48 A.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-03-31", "title": "Background Press Briefing on the Upcoming Visits of President al-Sisi of Egypt and His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123660", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:40 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First off, I want to catch everyone up who wasn't able to make the briefing last night on the executive orders on the trade -- executive orders that the President is going to be signing this afternoon.\nThe first order directs the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to examine every form of trade abuse and non-reciprocal practice that are currently contributing to the United States' large and persistent trade deficit, which was the largest of any major nation in 2016 at $500 billion.\nWithin 90 days, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative will submit a comprehensive report to the President on the causes of our unduly large deficit. It's the first time in modern history that an American President has called for such an investigation, and its -- our findings will allow us to make smarter decisions on behalf of the American people about our trade policy of our country going forward.\nThat's why the AFL-CIO, United Steelworkers International, the International Association of Machinists and the Aerospace Workers International all came out today to applaud the order.\nThe second order addresses the current lack of enforcement of one of our strongest tools in fighting unfair trade practices -- countervailing duties. Countervailing duties were put in place to address the problem of other countries dumping undervalued goods into American markets, making it impossible for American businesses to compete with artificially low prices.\nThis is especially a problem in countries whose governments subsidize exports into our country. So to discourage this practice, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency has a mechanism for assessing these type of transactions and imposing financial penalties, known as countervailing duties, when it's determined that this kind of malicious dumping has occurred.\nSince 2001, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency has not collected over $2.8 billion in these duties. If you think about it, we could do a lot by maximizing this enforcement power for our country. So we need to do a better job on behalf of the American worker. If a foreign company, often due to its being partly or entirely government-run or subsidized, is able to flood American markets with an artificially cheap steel, for example, they price American companies out of the system.\nSay you're the owner of a steel company in Ohio. You can't compete with some of these below-market prices. So you have to find other ways to meet your bottom line, like closing a factory and laying off workers, or might entirely having to close down entirely.\nBy not properly using this enforcement mechanism we're costing Americans who work in so many industries -- not just steel, but in agriculture, chemicals, machinery, and other manufactured good in particular\nPresident Trump was elected to do everything he can to support American workers and American manufacturers. Together, these two executive orders are a significant step in accomplishing the President's promise to end unfair trade practices once and for all.\nAlso, yesterday, we were pleased to see that Senators Manchin of West Virginia and Heitkamp announce their support for Judge Neil Gorsuch. And Senator Claire McCaskill conceded at a private event that among the list of potential nominees that the President released during a campaign, Judge Gorsuch was -- according to her, quote -- \"one of the better ones.\" We hope that her praise leads to additional support -- and her support.\nIt's hard to find any reason except for obstructionism to see why fellow Democrats in her caucus have not been able to join them.\nAs I said yesterday, Judge Gorsuch is highly regarded, having received a rating of \"well qualified\" from the American Bar Association, and has demonstrated an unparalleled and unprecedented level of transparency, including the release of over 75,000 pages of documents, fielding nearly 300 questions from Senate Democrats on the committee, and 70 pages of written answers about his personal records, and has demonstrated a mainstream judicial record -- with nearly all of the decisions being joined by Democrat-appointed judges.\nWithout a clear justification, Senate Democrats have fudged the facts on recent history, to try to mislead the American people about their unprecedented obstructionism, essentially claiming a non-existent 60-vote standard. As I've said before, should Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer get his way, this would be the first successful filibuster of a nominee to join the Supreme Court. This would make history in a very bad way.\nThey've also forgotten their own words. I've cited previously this week the rhetoric of Senator Schumer, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the regrets of invoking the filibuster by Senator -- President Obama, then Senator Obama, and the words of many other Senate Democrats, like Senator McCaskill, on why blocking a vote for a judge having gone through the process has no precedent and is irresponsible. Let me cite one more argument that many Senate Democrats have recently made.\nCurrent members of the Senate seem to also reject the notion of a Supreme Court operating with eight, not nine, justices. These include Senators Schumer, Dick Durbin, Bernie Sanders, Dianne Feinstein, Jeanne Shaheen, Richard Blumenthal, Amy Klobuchar, Ben Cardin and Martin Heinrich. Each of these Senate Democrats and the rest of their fellow caucus members need not listen to me or the President, but their own words as recently as last year.\nThe President told the American people in his Weekly Address that was launched earlier today why it is. And again, we call on Senate Democrats to end this unnecessary obstruction and confirm an imminently qualified jurist to the bench.\nAlso last night, the Department of Justice filed an appeal in the 9th Circuit to Hawaii's federal judge's preliminary injunction against the President's lawful and necessary executive order dealing with protecting this country.\nMoving on to some of the events of today. This morning, the President met with former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. They had an opportunity to talk about regional threats, current affairs hotspots, our attempt to defeat ISIS, and many more areas. It was a great meeting where they discussed many of the challenges facing our country. And the President sought the former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor's advice and opinions on a variety of subjects.\nHe also signed House Joint Resolution 42, allowing states to drug test unemployment insurance claims, and H.R. 1362, naming a VA outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa.\nAlso this morning, the President joined Jay Timmons, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, and some of its member CEOs to unveil the Association's annual Manufacturers' Outlook Survey. An incredible 93 percent of manufacturers surveyed by the National Association of Manufacturers now have a positive outlook for the future. That's a 20-year record high that's more than 35 points higher than that same rating was last year.\nTo quote from the survey itself, \"The rising confidence stems from the belief that the new administration in Washington, D.C. will bring much needed regulatory relief, as well as reforms to the tax code and a significant infrastructure package.\"\nThe optimism is evident across the spectrum of indicators. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up over 12 percent since Election Day. The National Association of Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. The Gallup Small Business Index shows that small business owners are the most optimistic they've been since 2007.\nIt's not surprising that American industry is reacting in this way. The President has taken immediate steps to make it easier to do business in this country. And we are just at the beginning of this process. On top of the significant steps taken in the executive orders this morning, he's also withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, cleared the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, began a much needed government-wide reform of our regulatory and permitting processes, and signed legislation preventing the burdensome streamline -- \"Stream Protection Rule\" from causing further harm to America's coal industry.\nThe President was glad to see this report add to the list of measurements reflecting the incredible optimism and positivity that his pro-growth policies have created.\nBack to this afternoon. The President will meet with the Director of the National Institutes of Health before signing the aforementioned executive orders on trade at 3:30 p.m. And he will meet with Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.\nIn Cabinet news today, the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is in Brussels, attending the NATO Foreign Ministers Meeting. There, he reaffirmed the Trump administration's steadfast commitment to NATO. Secretary Tillerson also stressed the need for all member countries to meet their defense spending commitments, as well as the need for NATO to take a larger role in the fight against terrorism and ISIS.\nThe President looks forward to meeting with his NATO counterparts in Brussels this May to reaffirm the United States' commitment to NATO and to discuss ways to strengthen the alliance in order to cope with challenges in national and international security.\nThis morning, the Office of the United States Trade Representative released the 2017 National Trade Estimate.\nThe annual report, which is required by law, surveys the significant barriers faced by American exporters. Its findings reinforce the need for the President's \"America First\" trade agenda, which prioritizes the enforcement of the trade laws to protect American workers and job creators. The President looks forward to having Ambassador Lighthizer in place as the USTR so that he can begin his important work in earnest and fulfill the mission of this report.\nAnd Transportation Secretary Chao -- who, yesterday, celebrated the 50th birthday of the Department of Transportation -- today directed the Federal Highway Administration officials to award $10 million in Emergency Relief funds to help begin repairs on Atlanta's collapsed I-85 Overpass. Releasing these funds will quickly help to ensure that the bridge is repaired safely and in a timely manner.\nThe White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has already talked with the Georgia Governor's team and Secretary Chao has spoken with the Governor.\nLooking forward -- as promised, today we will be releasing the U.S. OGE Form 378 financial reports as filed by commissioned officers here in the White House. Right after I'm done here we'll have a background briefing with Senior White House compliance and ethics officers to walk you through how that process is going to go and the public release of that information, which will occur later this evening. We'll be sure to update you if there's anything further to add.\nThis weekend, the President will be here in the White House holding meetings. We'll be sure to update you if there's anything further to add.\nAnd on Sunday, the White House will honor World Autism Awareness Day by lighting the White House in blue to join with the autism awareness community. Further research into the causes and treatments for autism spectrum disorders is one of the President's priorities. As we light it blue on Sunday, the White House will be celebrating all of the individuals and families whose lives are impacted by autism.\nI would note that it's a really interesting story how this came to be. The head of Autism Speaks, an organization that has done tremendous work with this, Bob Wright is one of the cofounders -- is a longtime friend of the President. His wife, Suzanne, was struggling with pancreatic cancer last year. And the President made a pledge to her. He said, if I'm elected President, in supporting this cause that you care so deeply about, I will light the White House blue. So it is in Suzanne and Bob Wright's honor that this will occur for this great cause. And I hope Bob knows that Suzanne is looking down proudly to see that that pledge has been fulfilled.\nWith that, I'll be glad to take your questions.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ: Sean, a couple of questions, if I could, about Chairman Nunes's visit to the White House. Fox News has been told by intelligence officials that Chairman Nunes is aware of who did the unmasking of certain individuals in the transition and may be aware of who ordered the unmasking of those individuals. Is the White House aware of that information?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what he knows, in the sense that that's -- and again, I've tried to make it a comment not to get into the specifics of that report.\nI will not -- I think it's not in our interest to talk about the process. What occurred between Chairman Nunes in coming here was both routine and proper. Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff, who I understand is expected here later today, both possess the appropriate credentials and clearances.\nWe've invited Democrats here, and I've been told that material they will see will shed light on the investigation. I know a lot of folks want to talk about the process and not the surveillance and the underlying issue of the substance -- the unmasking and leaks is what we should all be concerned about.\nIt affects all Americans, our liberties, our freedom, our civil liberties. So let's talk about some of the substance.\nAnd I know that's not -- but on March 2nd, day before the President's tweet, comments by a senior administration official, foreign policy expert, Dr. Evelyn Farkas, together with previous reports that have been out, raised serious concerns on whether or not there was an organized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information for political purposes. She admitted this on television by saying: \"I was urging my former colleagues, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill; I was telling people on the Hill, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can. I had a fear that they were essentially watching the Trump staff, and he was worried about the Trump administration.\"\nThat's what's out there. And I know NBC News has just reported something very similar about information that was used by the Obama White House to spread this information -- this politically sensitive information.\nDr. Farkas's admissions alone are devastating. On March 4th, the President -- as you all know -- raised serious questions about surveillance practices by the Obama administration, including whether or not the President-elect or the transition team members were being improperly monitored for political purposes under the Obama administration.\nLater in March, in the ordinary course of their work, NSC -- National Security Council staff discovered information that may support the questions raised by the President and Dr. Farkas's claim. These are serious issues. They raise serious concerns. And if true, the issues would be devastating.\nWe're committed to working with the House and Senate committees, as we've said multiple times, to get to the bottom of what happened here, why it happened, and who was involved.\nFor this reason, we're in the process of ensuring that the reports that the NSC staff discovered in the normal course of business are made available to those committees investigating to ensure that all of the facts come to light. And if everyone was treating the President and the administration fairly, you'd ask a series of much different questions about the substance than the materials.\nAs we've said before, when you talk about Russia in particular, everyone who has been briefed on this subject from Republican, to Democrat, to CIA, former Obama administration's Clapper, Brennan, you name it -- all of the people come back with the same conclusion -- and I think that is important -- that there has been no evidence of the President's campaign and Russian officials.\nIn fact, as you've heard me state before, it was Hillary Clinton who was the architect of the last administration's failed reset policy. She told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia. She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off one-fifth of our country's uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin.\nI think if there's -- you really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that's where we should be looking. That -- not there.\nQ: I wasn't expecting to tap quite such a deep well with that question. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: It's Friday.\nQ: Intelligence officials also tell us that Chairman Nunes knew about the documents that he viewed at the White House back in January, but ended up looking at them at the NSC SCIF only because he could not get access to those same documents through some of the other intelligence agencies. Basically it was a last resort to come here to the White House to view them. Do you know if that is the case?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. But I do think that it tracks everything that's been -- I saw a couple tweets the other day that I mentioned where people were saying that the NSA was trying to get documents. From a narrative of what's been out there -- and again, we have tried to be very careful about this and tried to be consistent about how we want this handled. But everything that he has said -- when he came out initially and talked to the media, he made it very clear that he had been looking into this. He had stated this much earlier than the President ever had raised this issue about surveillance and the unmasking of individuals for areas that had nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with substantive intelligence surveillance.\nSo I think that as we continue down this path, if you actually begin to focus really on the substance, I think we see more and more a very, very troubling and devastating path.\nQ: And just one more thing to clear up on process, if I could. We're also being told by intelligence officials that the two individuals who were identified yesterday -- Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis -- were not the source for the information, for the intelligence chairman. They did play an ancillary role in terms of finding some extra evidence here at the White House and helping to sign him in so that he could view the intelligence. Do you know if that's true?\nMR. SPICER: Again, John, I'm not -- if I start commenting on every one of these stories, I can't -- that's not our practice. Again, part of it is that if we confirm some things and not others we're going to go down a very slippery slope.\nI can say that we've continued to say that this is -- I think the substance of this matter and what continues to come to light in terms of Obama officials admitting either off the record or, frankly, on the record, consistent with what Dr. Farkas says, that there was clearly an attempt to do something politically motivated with the intelligence out there. And the question is why? Who else did it? Was it ordered? By whom?\nBut I think more and more, the substance that continues to come out on the record by individuals continues to point to exactly what the President was talking about that day on March 5th.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sean, we heard from the President this morning saying that Mike Flynn should ask for immunity. We also know the President has longstanding views on what immunity means. Back in September he said, \"If you aren't guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for?\" So does the President think that Mike Flynn is guilty of a crime?\nMR. SPICER: I think he believes that Mike Flynn should go testify. He thinks that he should go up there and do what he has to do to get the story out.\nQ: With or without immunity?\nMR. SPICER: That's up to him and his lawyer to decide. I'm not going to give Mike Flynn or anyone else legal advice from the podium, but I will tell you that the President's view is he should go up there, he should testify.\nQ: But the President gave legal advice from his Twitter account. He said Mike Flynn should ask for immunity.\nMR. SPICER: Right, I understand.\nQ: And he has said in the past that the only reason you ask for immunity if you committed a crime.\nMR. SPICER: Right, but I think the underlying point that you're missing, Jonathan, respectfully, is that what he's asking is, go testify, go get it out there, do what you have to do to get there and tell Congress and tell everyone exactly what we've been saying for a long time.\nSo I mean, again -- I get your point. But I think that the interesting thing is you actually stop for a second and realize what the President is doing is that he's saying, do whatever you have to do, to go up to make it clear what happened, take whatever precaution you want or however your legal counsel advises you.\nBut again, I've heard in some legal circles that the President could have exerted legal authority with him and Sally Yates and others. It's quite the opposite. And again, I think that that, compared to the narrative that you hear from a lot of the folks in this room all the time is a little bit opposite. Here you have a President who is telling Mike Flynn and others to go up there, make sure -- in fact, we talked about the other day with members of the administration that the President -- we've made -- volunteered -- this doesn't look like an administration that is not doing everything it can to get to the bottom of this in the appropriate way.\nAnd I think that that is an important distinction that has been lost on a lot of you, that every action that we have taken -- we've got up here and we've talked about Russia and the lack of a connection. We've talked about the fact that every single person who's been briefed has come away saying none exists -- Republican, Democrat, Obama appointee, et cetera.\nAnd yet, at the end of the day, the narrative still comes at us. And now, we're going to the point where we've actually encouraged people to go talk to the House and Senate Intelligence Committee and the appropriate investigators so that they can continue to get to the bottom of this and get it aside from us. I think that's quite the opposite of what you would normally think that somebody who was not trying to get to the bottom would do.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. One on taxes and one on trade, if I could. Back on February 9th, the President said the he would be presenting a phenomenal tax plan in the next two or three weeks. Tomorrow is April 1st; we haven't seen that tax plan. Can you tell us when the President is going to present his plan?\nMR. SPICER: I think, as you noticed -- yesterday Secretary Mnuchin and Gary Cohn and others on the team talked to the President about the process, and I think that we are working on engaging with key stakeholders. And when we feel it's appropriate that the President is given the appropriate amount of feedback, we'll start to put out the appropriate outline and process that we envision.\nBut at this time, that discussion is ongoing. We recognize, as you know -- we anticipated fully being engulfed in healthcare right now. And I think that we're accelerating that. The President has got his team working overtime. He's been giving them feedback as far as what he wants to see and how he wants to see it. But this is a big task. It's taken 30 years and we're going to get to it.\nQ: Is the White House going to write its own proposal here, or is this going to be like the healthcare debate where we thought we were going to see a proposal from the White House, but in the end the President sort of signed on to Paul Ryan's plan?\nMR. SPICER: First, I would dispute that we signed on to someone's plan. We worked with the House -- as you know, from the President's statements, we were very on board. I would suggest to you to say that we signed on to a plan -- it was a work that both sides worked together on. We worked with the Senate as well. And I think this plan -- I would assume that hopefully we come up with a plan that we all agree on.\nThe President will put out principles, I'm sure, as we've already done, in terms of what his goals are and how he wants to drive this as the process moves forward. But I'm sure that we're going to have a robust debate about aspects of that plan, certain provisions and certain other tax pieces. But we're going to work with the House and the Senate on it.\nQ: And on trade, the President, during the campaign -- he's now gearing up for this meeting with the Chinese President at Mar-a-Lago. During the campaign, he suggested that on day one, he would declare China a currency manipulator. He hasn't done that. Why hasn't the President followed through on that campaign promise?\nMR. SPICER: I think we need to have that meeting with President Xi. I'm sure that there will be a lot of discussions about our economic relationship. And so I don't -- we are days away from that, and let's see what those -- I just don't want to prejudge -- we're days away from it, and I know there's a lot of issues that need to come up and I don't want to get in front of it.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two, if I may. One on China, one on the Middle East. Does the administration plan to order a review into China's status as a nonmarket economy?\nMR. SPICER: At this time the two trade executive orders that focus on countervailing duties and -- are where we're going to look. I think we've got a lot -- obviously that's an issue that we would probably hope to have the U.S. trade representative confirmed. But that's a combined decision I think that in consultation with the Department of Commerce and the Department of Treasury.\nBut let's see how we go first.\nQ: And then can you clear up where the President stands on whether Bashar Assad is the legitimate President of Syria?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think with respect to Assad, there is a political reality that we have to accept in terms of where we are right now. We lost a lot of opportunity the last administration with respect to Assad. And I think that our statement that both U.N. Ambassador Haley gave yesterday and Secretary of State Tillerson reflects the reality that it's now up to the Syrian people.\nWe had an opportunity and we need to focus on now defeating ISIS. But the United States has profound priorities in Syria and Iraq, and we made it clear that counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of ISIS, is foremost among those priorities. And that's why our forces in the global coalition are partnering with local forces against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\nBut I mean -- I think there is a bit of political reality with respect to where we are now versus where we were the last administration in terms of there being a potential -- there is not the opposition that existed last time and the opportunities that existed last time.\nQ: It sounds like you're saying whether or not he's legitimate -- if you were to declare him illegitimate there's nothing the United States could do about that, so there's no point in --\nMR. SPICER: I think there is a bit of reality that has to be addressed with respect to the opportunity and the options that we have now that we don't have or didn't have -- they had in the last administration. And there is a reality that just doesn't exist in the same way.\nJon-Christopher.\nQ: Thank you. What's really the end game for Mr. Assad when the President speaks to his allies, his NATO partners? Obviously Assad is not going to retire somewhere in the south of France. Something has got to give. What is the thought there? What is the disposition, the conversation in terms of Assad, who is very close to Mr. Putin and would like to have a warm water port in the Mediterranean?\nMR. SPICER: I think we believe there's a need to deescalate violence and to have a political process through which Syrians will decide their own political future consistent with the principles that have been enshrined in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254. But there's a bit of -- as I mentioned just a second ago, there's a bit of reality on the ground in terms of what the options are.\nQ: During the presidential campaign the President said he was with the state on North Carolina's law banning transgender people from using certain restrooms. The Democratic governor yesterday signed a deal to replace that law with a measure that civil rights groups still say is discriminatory. Does the President support this law?\nMR. SPICER: I have not asked the President. I would say consistent with what he said during the campaign cycle he believes in states' rights, so --\nQ: -- different issue, but what is the President's personal view on bathrooms for transgender people and the way states should approach it?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the President has made it clear -- this issue came up when Caitlyn Jenner in particular came to Trump Tower and he said he didn't really care. But I think it is a state and local issue, not one that he believes needs federal attention.\nMatt.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Given that it's financial disclosure day, why will the White House not be releasing --\nMR. SPICER: -- proclamation on that. (Laughter.)\nQ: Why won't the White House not be releasing the President's 2016 tax returns, given, conceivably, those can't be under audit yet while the audit has obviously been the reason for why you haven't released those past returns?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, look, asked and -- I mean, the President has been very clear about his tax returns and his position on that. The Office of Government Ethics requires every federal employee at a certain level to file these financial disclosure forms, that anyone in America can go on to -- it will be the first time, I believe -- and I don't want to get ahead of the background briefing to give away the good stuff -- but I believe that this is the first time that they're on the White House website. We are making them more accessible, more available than in history.\nQ: So then why not make this step --\nMR. SPICER: I think that's apples and oranges. These are required by law. These lists -- just for everyone who's not familiar with them, the financial disclosure forms that we file -- I think it's called a 278 -- reveal every asset you own, every debt that you have, your spouse's income, your spouse's employment, holdings that you have, credit card debt, other -- I mean, it is a fairly comprehensive undertaking of every asset that a person owns, every debt that they have.\nAnd I think that that is a very clear understanding of the assets that people have, the value of those assets, both in terms of whether they're worth something or the liabilities that they're incurring. That is a very, very transparent way of being able to understand someone's -- and so to equate the two is rather --\nQ: Sure, I just was using that as a jumping-off point for the tax returns question.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'll jump back.\nQ: If the audit is not the reason for the returns --\nMR. SPICER: I didn't say --\nQ: -- because there can't be an audit of --\nMR. SPICER: Right, but you'll also remember that taxes aren't due until the 15th of April.\nQ: So can we expect them on the 15th of April?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I'm not -- I don't know. I haven't really gotten into -- I'm worried about getting my own done. But I'll --\nQ: Are you going to release them?\nMR. SPICER: No. (Laughter.) But I think that -- again, I think that, respectfully, you look at what we're doing, frankly -- and again, this will be discussed after this is done -- but I think there is an element of going above and beyond what has been done in the past to make sure that people have access to this. There is a lot of people -- I think one of the really interesting things that people are going to see today -- and I think it's something that should be celebrated -- is that the President has brought a lot of people into this administration, and this White House in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful by this country, and have given up a lot to come into government by setting aside a lot of assets. And I think it speaks volumes to the desire for a lot of these people to fulfill the President's vision and move the agenda forward that they are willing to list all of their assets, undergo this public scrutiny, but also set aside a lot.\nBecause you'll see that people are often told they have to sell an asset or get rid of something to come serve in the government. And there's a lot of people that have done a lot to come into this administration to give back, that have been inspired by the President's victory and the President's agenda to move the country forward.\nJim.\nQ: General Flynn's attorney said that his client has a \"story to tell.\" Is the White House concerned that General Flynn has damaging information about the President, his aides, his associates about what occurred during the campaign with respect to Russia?\nMR. SPICER: Nope.\nQ: Okay. The other thing I wanted to ask you, to follow up on that, is, you were just saying a few moments ago that some of this information that would be helpful to the committee -- you were talking about Evelyn Farkas and so forth -- that seems to be something that pertains to during the transition. But the President's tweets time and again talked about \"tapping my phones\" in October just prior to the election. \"Just found out Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory.\"\nI'm just kind of -- I want to get something clear about the time frame. Does the White House have any information -- is it providing any information to these Intelligence Committees that would draw these members to the conclusion that there was some kind of surveillance going on before the election as the President originally alleged?\nMR. SPICER: So again, I don't want to specifically get in -- but I think if we're splitting hairs about what day of the calendar it was, that's a pretty interesting development. I think that we have now come to a place where I think that we can --\nQ: The President's allegations --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But if the allegation is, well, it was actually on the 1st of December or the 10th of December versus the 31st of October, I think that we're starting to split some serious hairs here.\nThe idea that -- and again, I just -- it's interesting that now we're arguing over the date, not the substance. And the substance is why were people using government resources, violating civil liberties, potentially -- looking into people's backgrounds to surveil them, to understand what they were doing, and who they were, to unmask them, provide their names to sources; spread classified information, make it available to others, spread it to places that they weren't supposed to use it --\nQ: Then --\nMR. SPICER: But, hold on, let me just -- I think that it is interesting. Because again, I get your question. But if what we're really arguing is did it happen on a Monday or a Tuesday, or did it happen on the 31st versus the 7th or the 8th, I think we've lost focus here. There is --\nQ: But you started off as allegations --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. I'll answer. Just let me finish --\nQ: -- surveillance and --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that.\nQ: -- not that the dates are changing.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, they're not. I didn't say they were changing. Just to be clear. I'm just saying that it is -- it is fascinating to me that we are now arguing over the date, not the substance.\nI understand your point. And if we get down to that, we come out and you really want to get into what date -- because I think it is really getting lost in the debate that American citizens who were not government employees at the time, who were not targets of stuff potentially were surveilled, had their information unmasked, made it available, was politically spread. And all of this should be very concerning to people that an administration or people in an administration, people serving in government who are provided classified information, who are given clearance in the trust of the United States government misused, mishandled, and potentially did some very, very bad things with classified information.\nThat astonishes me that that is not the subject of this; that all of this is happening in our country, and yet the subject -- and again, we talk about what door someone came in, what date it happened -- there is a concern that people misused, mishandled, misdirected classified information, leaked it out, spread it out, violated civil liberties. And the potential that that happened should concern every single American.\nQ: And to follow up on that, I think we are concerned about the substance just as much as the process. But the details matter. But I just want to make sure -- you clearly -- because it seems like you're going farther than what we've heard in previous briefings. It sounds like you are, just as the President is, alleging that the Obama administration conducted unlawful surveillance on the Trump campaign and Trump transition team.\nMR. SPICER: What I am saying very clearly is that as --\nQ: Do you have evidence of that?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, I don't. I know that what has been provided to -- as I said in the statement, I believe that what has been provided and will be provided to members of both committees I think should further their investigation. I think that the revelations of Evelyn Farkas, who played a senior role in the Obama administration, going on the record to talk about how they politically used classified information is troubling.\nI believe that the reports that are coming out day by day that NBC has just reported, that John just detailed what Fox has reported -- day by day, more and more, we are seeing that the substance of what we've been talking about continues to move exactly in the direction that the President spoke about in terms of surveillance that occurred. And that should be very troubling. That, frankly, should be something that everyone looks at and says, what's going on here? Why did it happen? Who did it? And how are we going to get to the bottom of it? That's what concerns me.\nSteve Holland.\nQ: Can I go back to China for a second? The President yesterday said that the meeting next week with China will be a difficult one, and he referred to massive trade deficits. Now what sort of tone is he hoping to set for this meeting?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think he's been very clear --\nQ: Why is it going to be so difficult?\nMR. SPICER: Why is what?\nQ: Why is it going to be so difficult, as he says?\nMR. SPICER: Why -- there's big issues. I don't think it's a surprise to anybody in terms of -- we've got both national security issues in terms of our political posture towards North Korea, the threat of a missile that extends further and further, the tests that they're using, their nuclear capability. Those should all be very concerning.\nAnd then on the trade front, we've got serious concerns with what they're doing, our trade practices with them, some of the things that were mentioned in the past. But there's a lot of areas that we need to be concerned about with trade. And I think that -- this isn't a sit around and play patty-cake kind of conversation. They're big issues. The President has been making it very clear since -- for decades, frankly, of the challenges that we face. And I think he wants to have a very good and respectful and healthy relationship. But he also wants to make sure that he tackles the challenges and the problems that are facing American workers and American manufacturers and get to them.\nI'm going to go to my first seat, and then Glenn because he's patient. First Skype seat, Maurice Goodman, from WWDB-AM in Philly. So shout out to Hallie's old stations.\nQ: In Philadelphia. It's Randall Jefferson. The question is: President Trump signed an executive order that he intends to not fund cities that refuse to share immigration status information. Attorney General Sessions recently suggested that cities could not only lose future funds but that the federal government may require them to pay back grants. Will there be a -- when and will -- when will this take place? And will that money be reallocated to other departments like the Department of Education or HBCUs?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not -- I would say that the President finds it unacceptable that some localities and counties and potentially some states have prioritized a political agenda over the safety of their people by flouting our nation's immigration laws, becoming so-called sanctuary cities.\nThe failure to follow federal law can have tragic consequences for all of our citizens and all of our country. It's particularly concerning in a place like Chicago and other cities like yours in Philadelphia where there's been increased violence. Immigrants both legal and illegal are not safe from criminals who have committed egregious acts are free to roam the streets.\nAnd the Attorney General has issued a public notice reminding all states and local jurisdictions of their responsibilities to comply with federal laws.\nWith respect to the budget piece, I think we've had an ongoing budget process, and we'll have to see how many states comply and where, if any, potential savings are there and then how we allocate them. But I think the President's budget -- both his FY17 contingency budget for funding beyond this continuing resolution on April 28th, and then his FY18 budget that he's already submitted -- are going to reflect some key priorities both in terms of homeland security and national defense.\nSo we'll see where we would reallocate any of that money, but I think the priority is clear is to get cities into compliance and to make sure that we understand there's not just a financial impact to this but also a very clear security aspect of this.\nGlenn.\nQ: Two things, Sean. First, just to follow up on something you said before. You said that Hillary Clinton had personal contact with Vladimir Putin, and the suggestion was that wasn't necessarily appropriate. Can you just elaborate what you were --\nMR. SPICER: Oh, no, I'm not saying that's -- the contact in itself is not appropriate -- is not --\nQ: I mean, as a private citizen or as a --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think what I'm saying is that when you talk about connections to Russia, I think the only connection that anyone has made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he's -- some of the -- he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians, and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That's his connection.\nWhen you talk about the other side, you look at what the Obama administration's connections were. You have a Secretary of State that was selling a fifth of our country's uranium. You have a Clinton Foundation concern with some of the donations they got. You've got the former President, her husband, giving paid speeches, getting a personal call from Vladimir Putin. You've got a stated goal of that administration, of Secretary Clinton to have a reset to \"strengthen Russia.\"\nSo when you compare the two sides in terms of who's actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions and yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it, and yet --\nQ: So you think that her pattern of behavior is more suspicious than President Trump's pattern of behavior?\nMR. SPICER: I think that if you compare the two it's definitely -- when you talk about the stuff that went to their foundation, the concerns that existed around the sale of one-fifth of all the country's uranium, the paid speeches, the personal calls from Vladimir Putin -- I think that when you want to look at a connection to Russia there is a clear one there, and much less of one that ever existed on this side.\nQ: So, Sean, in terms of the Nunes chronology, just to clarify, when we're asking questions about process like gates and people, we're not attempting to ascertain the geography of the executive complex, we want to know who knew what and when.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that.\nQ: So my question is -- so I will ask that directly, forget about the technical questions. Mr. Nunes was on the campus. You say we don't know who let him in the gate, so apparently it is -- and you described that, I believe, this is a normal process, right? Tell me if it is normal the way that I'm describing it. Mr. Nunes, the head of an investigatory committee, is allowed to roam around the executive complex -- we don't know who let him in -- to speak to two deputy-level members of the National Security Council. He is then allowed to see information. He then obtains an appointment, from my understanding of the chronology, with the President of the United States to disgorge that information. He then goes public with that information. Then seven or so days later, you say it would be appropriate for everybody to come down here and look at it. Is that a normal process?\nMR. SPICER: Well, A, I would take issue with a number of the aspects of your chronology. Number one, which you're forgetting, is that initially he is the one that publicly said well before any of this came to light in terms of the President's March 5th tweet that he was just looking into this whole matter. He, according to John Roberts, his own reporting, just said that neither of those individuals as described in your paper's reporting are accurate. So I would dispute several of the pieces that -- and then as far as him roaming around the White House --\nQ: Well, you won't tell us who let him in, so we don't know.\nMR. SPICER: No, I understand this, but you -- again, you jump to a ton of conclusions about -- and again, I love watching some of these shows where they jump to conclusions --\nQ: -- several times prejudged the investigation as clearing the White House. You said it twice at the podium today.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: So we're not prejudging --\nMR. SPICER: What I'm saying is -- because I'm focused on the substance of this, Glenn.\nQ: Well, what --\nMR. SPICER: Right, and so where is any of the reporting been in your paper about Evelyn Farkas and her revelation that this is what they sought to do? Where has been the reporting in your paper that NBC News just recently covered that other officials -- you seem to be really focused on who showed up where and what door they went in and how it happened.\nTo answer your question, yes, it's appropriate for a member of Congress to contact someone who has contacted him, according to some of these reports. I don't know the answer to that, but if you're asking me is it appropriate for a member of Congress to come over here -- as Chairman Nunes has said himself, he wasn't hiding or roaming, he was asked to come over here by an individual. He came over, which happens daily. He was asked to go somewhere, he went there. He is cleared. And nothing that is inappropriate other -- exactly the opposite. What he did, what he saw, and who he met with was 100 percent proper.\nQ: Did the Chief of Staff, who is, at my understanding, an exceptionally attentive gatekeeper to who comes in and out of the Oval Office, did the Chief of Staff know that he was on the campus? Did he approve his --\nMR. SPICER: But remember, you're -- okay, but you're playing cute there. You're doing two things. One is you're talking about the Oval Office and the other one is the campus. So, no, the Chief of Staff does not know every single person who's on the 18 acres at any given time. They are people who are appropriately either cleared or WAVEd through the system or are escorted on in some way, shape or form.\nNo, we don't track every single person who's on the 18 acres. Do we know, generally speaking, who's in the Oval Office? Not all the time, because people can go in. But if there was a meeting -- in that case, we all sat back here, he made the announcement -- and again, you're leaving out a key part. He actually briefed the press before he told anyone. We all found -- you, me, everyone else -- that he was coming down here after he held a press conference with your colleagues to say he was coming down here based on stuff that he had found that didn't have to do with Russia that a whistle-blower source had given him.\nNow, the other reporting that I'm hearing today is actually that the sources that you describe in your paper are not accurate. And while I'm not going to comment on either, I think there is an assumption that everything -- and the chronology that we know is accurate -- which I don't believe, from further reporting, that it is.\nAnd I also believe that some of the comments that have come out publicly in terms of some of the Obama administration are conveniently left out of that discussion. I think that that is interesting how no one seems to really cover the fact that in a -- senior Obama administration with high-level clearances talked about the spreading of classified information for political purposes and no one seems to care.\nQ: But just to be clear, Mr. Pribus, Mr. Kushner, Mr. Bannon did not have knowledge of his being on the campus, having this interaction with --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. Again, you asked two questions and you melded them together. No one knew that he was coming to speak to the President. He announced that on television during a press conference.\nQ: My understanding is that Dr. Farkas left the administration in 2015. So why is what she said in 2017 relevant to something that allegedly happened in 2016?\nMR. SPICER: The question I would have for you is -- exactly, why is it -- what does - she says inner things -- I'm urging my colleagues, I'm urging it to get -- the Hill. But it's odd that the presumption seems to be why is it interesting. Have you asked her?\nQ: No, you're the one telling us to -- from you right now.\nMR. SPICER: No, you haven't. So she -- no, no, but she's been on television talking about what she's done, and you seem to have made no --\nQ: I don't believe everything I see on TV. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Well, neither do I, but I also -- I would assume that as a reporter that actually is interested in the story, a senior Obama administration official that handled Russia --\nQ: Former.\nQ: Former, in 2015.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, well, all Obama administration officials generally are --\nQ: No, but she wasn't there in 2016.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, I appreciate the timeline. I'm well aware of when it was. But my point is, is you seem to be rushing to her defense. At some point, she came on -- she went on television and talked about actions that he and her colleagues took to spread classified information. And instead of -- Jonathan, instead of defending her, it might be worth asking her what she's talking about, who she spread it to, why she did it, was it appropriate, who cleared her to do it.\nMaybe those are questions you can ask instead of asking me to defend why a former Obama administration official is revealing stuff that should be extremely concerning. So I'm going to go back to --\nQ: Yeah, one other question, which is, are you more concerned about that or Russian interference in the presidential election?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that there -- as an American citizen I'm very concerned about the fact that people potentially were sharing information about other Americans for political purposes and using classified information to do so and leaking it. That should be concerning to everybody.\nQ: So the Russian interference --\nMR. SPICER: No, that's not what I said. Please stop trying to -- it's not --\nQ: My question is which is worse?\nMR. SPICER: And I guess I don't -- I mean, the answer is, I think if someone is interfering with our election, that's not good. I don't think that someone revealing and leaking classified information is good either. I'm not sure that you should have to choose. I think that you can have outrage and concern for both, and I don't think we should have to pick as an American whether or not -- which freedom we want to have undermined. I think we should accept both of them.\nAnd so the idea that we should have to choose whether or not we want someone to interfere with our election or protect our civil liberties isn't one that we should want or that we should have questioned.\nAlexis.\nQ: Can I just ask three basic kind of follow-up to questions. You've used two phrases here today. One is really pretty sensitive information and the other is classified information when you're talking about what the President believes was released. Because you said yesterday that you, yourself, had not seen the information -- and that's my understanding of today -- are those terms interchangeable, or are they different in terms of what you know from the podium was released?\nMR. SPICER: So there's actually a classification level. There is certain sensitive information on individuals, while not classified, is considered stuff that the government protects. Then there's secret, there's top secret, and -- without getting into it -- there's a lot higher.\nThere are differences in classification levels. So while you may not reveal a piece of classified information, what they call PII information, is sensitive information, according to the government standards. So they are different. Each of them has a different classification level.\nQ: But it's your understanding -- you've been told that the material that the President is sharing with the committees includes classified information as well as politically sensitive information -- that's your understanding?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: All right. Next question -- you said Congressman Schiff is coming today?\nMR. SPICER: That's my -- I know that he had -- I don't -- he has made contact and is trying to arrange a time.\nQ: And can you share with us who will be responsible for escorting him to the proper place, showing him the materials, walking him through it, letting him absorb it? Is he bringing staff? Can you just explain the --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that question. I know that they were arranging a time, et cetera. I think it's going to -- a lot of it will detail who -- if he is requesting it. I don't know the nature of -- I know that the request was made, and that's one that -- there's follow-up with the staff at the staff level to determine all those things.\nQ: The two that the President has wanted to share with the House and the Senate committees -- has it already been shared with the FBI or does the FBI already have the material?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that. Some of it -- I don't know. It's NSC -- NSC pulls materials from the various agencies, so where that all came from -- is it a single source, is it a combination of those -- I don't know the answer to that.\nQ: Can you get the answer to that?\nMR. SPICER: I can ask. Again, part of it is there's a question of whether or not we have the ability or the release it. And again, as much as I appreciate where it came from, I think, again, I go back to does it really matter? Does it matter if it came from the CIA or the NSA, or another three-letter agency, or is the issue, Alexis, whether or not, as I've said before -- whether or not there is a concern about what that information is doing, who used it improperly, what possibly could have happened. I mean, again, it's where it came from.\nQ: What I'm asking is, the executive branch -- the FBI has a separate investigation. I'm asking -- the President believes he has evidence that is germane to that investigation, as broad as Director Comey has described.\nMR. SPICER: Well, first of all, just so we're clear, the FBI's investigation pertains specifically to, from what the Director said in open testimony, to Russia. What the President's -- this is not what I believe they are investigating or --\nQ: I misunderstood. I thought that the FBI also had broadened the investigation beyond just simply Russia.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I'm not aware of that.\nQ: If you could just find out --\nMR. SPICER: You can call the FBI. I'm not going to call the FBI and ask them what their investigation is, and then you'll write a story about how I called the FBI.\nQ: I'm asking you a separate question. Does the President believe that it is important for the FBI to have the information that he finds to be so egregiously offensive, that politically sensitive information was shared by the previous administration? I'm asking you a really simple question.\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- no, it's not. You think it's simple, but I think the reality is it depends where it came from, who can share it. You're acting as though it's a very -- you're acting as though it's a very simple process. It depends on the level of classification, who it came from, whether they have the authority to share it. There's a lot of things that go into this. And I know that it sounds really easy; it's not. And I think that there -- I know that a lot of times that just because it can get leaked out doesn't mean it's being handled appropriately. And I think there is a desire to make sure that this is done correctly and within the proper guidance of who has the authority to see the right things, and that all of the procedures are followed.\nThat doesn't mean we just get to, willy-nilly, pick stuff and send it around to whoever. There is a reason that certain information is handled the way it is, so that we protect the methods and processes that are in accordance with the intelligence community.\nJohn.\nQ: This morning, the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, took issue with the President's tweet. He said he does not believe that the Russian investigation that's being conducted by the FBI, by the Senate Intelligence Committee, by the House Intelligence Committee is a witch hunt. Why does the President believe it's a witch hunt? He also said -- before I get your answer to that -- he also said that he doesn't think it's proper for the President to sort of tweet out or comment on ongoing investigations. Can you also touch on that as well?\nMR. SPICER: I think part of this sometimes comes down to who has access to what information and what they're looking at. So I don't know what he has seen or not seen, or whether it's appropriate. But again, I think there's a whole -- the reason that we've asked the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to look into this is to make sure that we get to the bottom of it in an appropriate, proper manner.\nQ: Commenting on an ongoing investigation, is that proper by the President?\nMR. SPICER: What ongoing?\nQ: Well, there's an investigation that's ongoing by the FBI right now. There's an ongoing investigation that's ongoing by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. And --\nQ: Should he be commenting on that?\nMR. SPICER: And which comment are you referring to?\nQ: The \"witch hunt.\"\nMR. SPICER: Right, but I think when you -- as I just said to Alexis, I think there's a difference between the investigations that have been discussed about Russia that we've been very clear about and a discussion about whether something -- as Devin Nunes has said very publicly, the information that he had with respect to surveillance during the 2016 election cycle had nothing to do with Russia.\nSo there's this seeming assumption that -- what the President has talked about is very clear -- there is an ongoing pattern and more and more revelations that what we have seen is that something potentially was very, very bad that's happening and people were using classified information -- not with respect to Russia, but to surveil people during that cycle. And that is adversely different.\nThere is no -- as far as I know -- we've asked the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees to look into this whole matter -- there is no \"investigation\" that I'm aware of.\nQ: You take issue with Jason Chaffetz's --\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'll let him speak for himself. My point is, though, there is obviously -- I believe Chairman Nunes and others who have looked into this and see the information are probably in a much better position to discuss the situation at hand and understand what's happening.\nI'm going to go to Edward Marshall from WBBM in Chicago.\nQ: Actually, it's Derrick Blakley at WBBM in Chicago. Thank you. I have a question, and if at all possible, a follow-up as well. Chicago gets about $12 million a year in law enforcement assistance from the federal government. Would President Trump cut off those funds due to the sanctuary city status even though it would greatly hamper the police fight against street violence, something the President has repeatedly said troubles him greatly?\nMR. SPICER: I think that you -- it's interesting, you talk about street violence and then we cut off the funding for sanctuary cities. I think it would be interesting to want to send more money to a city that is allowing people to come into the country who are breaking the law, who, in many cases, are committing crimes -- member of gangs. And so you can't be a sanctuary city and at the same time seem to pretend or express concern about law enforcement or ask for more money when probably a number of the funds that you're using in the first place are going to law enforcement to handle the situation that you've created for yourself.\nI think the President's belief on sanctuary cities is one shared by upwards of 80 percent of the American people that we shouldn't be using American tax dollars to fund cities and counties and, in some cases, potentially states that are seeking to allow people who are not legally in this country, who potentially can do us harm, to get funding.\nAnd so I think there's no question -- it's not a question of what he will do. His intentions have been very clear from the beginning. I think it's vastly supported by the vast majority of the American people. But I think that to suggest that somehow they're not inextricably linked is a failure to fully appreciate the scenario.\nQ: Can I follow up? Does that mean the President is more interested in deporting illegal immigrants than he is with putting shooters and killers in jail?\nMR. SPICER: No. Because if a shooter or killer is here illegally and he's in this country, then I think that -- again, I think, respectfully, you're delinking the two issues. If you have people who are in this country illegally that are part of a gang, that are part of -- they're committing -- a threat to public safety or committing a crime, then funding that activity and allowing that to fester is in itself a problem. And so by not rooting that out in the first place is allowing the problem to continue and not exactly showing an attempt to solve it in the first place.\nBlake.\nQ: Let me ask you about the two executive orders that are about to be signed. Peter Navarro said this morning that they have nothing to do with the China trip next week. So is it just purely coincidence that it's happening now and the President is set to meet with his counterpart in China next week? Or is this somewhat setting the table for what might come next week?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think they are both broad-based. I mean, countervailing duties is not something that's targeted at any specific country. So I don't think that you could use that as some kind of indication of any one country. I think we're giving up $2.8 billion a year and that's coming through our borders all across. So that one.\nAnd the other one specifically talks about every form of trade abuse and non-reciprocal practice that are currently contributing to our deficit. So there's a lot of countries that contribute to that, and I think a lot of times the trade agreements that we've made in some cases haven't been looked at or revived in a very long time. And so for either one of them to be suggested at any particular country would be a misread of either one.\nQ: You mentioned that the President has signaled his intention to withdraw from TPP, you've got Keystone, you've got these executive orders, a whole host of others. The second executive order that's coming today talks about a -- or the first one -- a 90-day review.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: The one that's still outstanding is NAFTA and what the President wants to do with that. So does that move the NAFTA timeline potentially back 90 days? Does he want to see this 90-day review first before getting to NAFTA?\nMR. SPICER: I think the first thing he wants to do is get Robert Lighthizer confirmed as the next U.S. Trade Representative so that we can have someone at the helm of that agency to really shepherd the trade agenda and help with the priorities.\nI know that Peter and Secretary Ross were here yesterday, and Secretary Ross and Secretary Mnuchin and others have been very involved in the trade agenda. But we really need someone in the front of the ship to help us guide us through it. And that review and others are part of that.\nMajor.\nQ: Do you have a timeline?\nMR. SPICER: I don't.\nQ: You frequently tell us to take the President's tweets at face value and they speak for themselves. So when the President says Mike Flynn should get immunity, is he suggesting to Congress that it grant immunity?\nMR. SPICER: I think Mike Flynn and his legal counsel should do what's appropriate for Mike Flynn.\nQ: Right, but that is -- they cannot obtain immunity. It must be granted --\nMR. SPICER: Right, and again to your question --\nQ: -- by Congress.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: You have the President recommending either to the FBI or to Congress that it grant immunity. Because that's the only way it can happen.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But again, he didn't say Congress should grant, and I think --\nQ: That's what I'm asking. What does he mean by that?\nMR. SPICER: And I think that his -- what he means is he support Mike Flynn's attempts to go up to Congress and be very clear with everything that they ask and what they want.\nQ: Right. But he could have just said \"and testify.\" He said he should be immunity.\nMR. SPICER: Right.,\nQ: And I'm asking you because it's an important --\nMR. SPICER: It is.\nQ: Every lawyer who works on this tells you it's extremely important to seek it and then obtain it. And there's only one way you can seek it, by it being granted either by the FBI or by Congress. And for the President of the United States to even lightly indicate that he is in favor of that it seems to is a significant development. And I'm trying to find out if that's what the President was trying to accomplish.\nMR. SPICER: And I think what -- and I'm trying to answer the question, which is that I think that what -- not that I think -- I've talked to the President about this. I think what he --\nQ: You have?\nMR. SPICER: Yes. And the President is very clear that he wants Mike Flynn to go and be completely open and transparent with the committee. And whatever it takes to do that, he is supportive of.\nQ: Even if he doesn't obtain immunity?\nMR. SPICER: He wants him to -- again, I want to be clear, he wants him to do what is necessary to go up there and talk to the committees of jurisdiction to get this matter behind us.\nQ: And since you've talked to the President about this, he was not trying to suggest to the FBI or the Justice Department that it grant immunity to Mike Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think he was -- I'm not entirely sure of the process -- whether the Congress does it, or DOJ, or both in this case. But the point that --\nQ: -- any other venue --\nMR. SPICER: I get it, but the --\nQ: It would be different.\nMR. SPICER: Right, I understand. Right. But the bottom line is --\nQ: He's not instructing his Justice Department to do this?\nMR. SPICER: No, what he is instructing is Mike Flynn to do everything he can to cooperate with the committees that he's asked to look into this.\nZeke.\nQ: You talked about -- one more thing. You said Congressman Schiff is coming over here, the Senate Intelligence --\nMR. SPICER: And let me just be clear because I know -- before you continue, I just want to be crystal clear. I know that he's communicated. Our expectation is -- I don't --\nQ: He said he was --\nQ: He put out a press release.\nMR. SPICER: Well, there we go. Thank you, Zeke.\nQ: You just cleared up a lot of --\nMR. SPICER: I know. But sometimes you --\nQ: The Senate Intelligence Committee put out a statement yesterday that I just want to read to you -- or part of it.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: The committee has asked the White House to direct the agencies that own the intelligence documents in question to immediately provide them directly to the committee. Does the White House have any problem with that, or believe they're --\nMR. SPICER: I think we're looking into that. I think obviously we would have hoped that, like Congressman Schiff, they would come and see these documents.\nI don't know. I know that the counsel's office is in contact with them with respect to that.\nQ: Do you see any problem with this procedure?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not -- Major, respectfully, the counsel's office is working with them. I don't want to get in front of what the -- how they go back and forth and make a decision on that.\nQ: It's not an illegitimate request.\nQ: Schiff is asking the same thing, too?\nQ: Is this an illegitimate request? That's all I'm trying to figure out.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I don't know. It's not -- I think -- I want to say the goal would be --\nQ: -- you said we don't know who owns it.\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm letting -- the White House Counsel's Office sent that letter. They are the ones whom those individuals have been in contact with. Obviously, we'd like them to come see that information, which is what we think would help them further their review of this situation.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But what I'm telling you is it's not my decision, Major. This is a discussion that is occurring between both of those committees and the White House Counsel's Office.\nQ: I'm just asking, as the representative of the President, because it is his decision --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And as you're telling me, it's happening in real time -- the Schiff piece of it happening in real time. I don't know the answer because it's happening while we're here. So I don't have an answer for us on that.\nThe White House Counsel's Office is in communication with the committee, in particular, and with Congressman Schiff's office about arranging how that would go down. I don't know what further discussions they've had since we've been out here.\nQ: So really quick just to follow up. You said that the U.S. is giving up $2.8 billion a year in countervailing --\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: Peter Navarro was up here last night and said that sum applied to a 16-year period. I was hoping you could clarify the facts on that.\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'll ask Peter to --\nQ: Peter Navarro had it as a far smaller sum over a larger --\nMR. SPICER: Right, I'll have to ask Peter to --\nQ: Thanks. The second thing, follow-up on Alexis's question. You've made some serious allegations about civil liberties and potentially mishandling of classified information. Why wouldn't the White House, if it believed -- hand it over to the federal agency tasked with investigating crimes --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not -- that's not -- because I think -- first of all, I don't know what we will or will not do going forward, and I don't want to prejudge that. What I do know is that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are both the committees that we -- the President had asked on that Sunday a few weeks ago to look into this. And I think that's who is conducting and who've we'd asked to look into it. And that's appropriate. And I'm not aware that anyone else asked us for that information.\nQ: And one final one. Earlier in the briefing you said we don't track every -- we don't track every person who is on the 18 acres --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, he asked about whether or not the Chief of Staff knew everyone who was on the 18 acres. That's what he asked.\nQ: So -- but when it comes to that, do you have any information about how the Chairman did get onto the campus, who WAVEd him in?\nMR. SPICER: As I said over the last few days, I'm not going to discuss --\nQ: Will you release -- sorry, the WAVES records?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, I think all of that is going to happen as soon as -- there will be a discussion about a lot of in the briefing that's going to talk about the financial disclosure forms and such as immediately as this concludes.\nPart of that. So with that, thank you, guys, very much. So we're going to get onto the next briefing. Thank you very much.\nEND 2:44 P.M.

Our new administration has so much change underway; change that is going to strengthen our Union and improve so many people's lives.\nIn the next few days, the Senate will be taking a very important step, one that will protect the rule of law and democratic way of life that is absolutely a birthright of all Americans. And it involves one of my most important actions as President. That was nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia.\nJudge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified. He has a sterling record. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals. But Judge Gorsuch's nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications. It's about preserving our Republic.\nIn their great wisdom, the Founders placed legislative powers in its own separate branch of Government. Elected representatives from all across the country come together. They host hearings, they listen to the concerns of the people, and then they try to write laws that address those concerns and make life better for all Americans. It's a process that is meant to take time and energy to ensure that every new law will better serve our wonderful citizens. That's how our democratic process works.\nThe duty of judges, therefore, is not to rewrite the laws, but to uphold the laws and to apply the Constitution as written. That is the solemn duty of every Justice on the Supreme Court, and this is what Judge Gorsuch will do.\nIn recent years, we've seen more and more judges make decisions not based on the Constitution or the rule of law, but based on their preferences, their personal views, or even their political opinions. Each time a judge substitutes their own opinions for an unbiased reading of the law, they damage our democracy. They put their own will above the will of the people, and they undermine the legislative process that has always been the heartbeat of our democracy.\nThe Senate will soon have the chance to help preserve our democratic institutions for our children, by voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\nJudge Gorsuch is going to serve our people by devoting himself to our beloved Constitution. The Senate saw this firsthand in hours of Judge Gorsuch's impressive testimony. In every step of the process, what has been clear to all is that Judge Gorsuch is a man who respects the law. He defends the Constitution. And in so doing, he will protect our freedoms.\nWith Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, America will be a more free, fair, and just nation for all of our citizens.\nThank you, and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2017-03-31", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Hello, everybody.\nParticipants. Good morning.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much. We have some really good news today that's really fantastic—these numbers. Today I'm delighted to welcome the National Association of Manufacturers to the White House. It's a great group of people. I know many of them well.\nAnd I want to thank your president and CEO Jay Timmons for being here with us today. Great job.\nNational Association of Manufacturers President and Chief Executive Officer Jay Timmons. Thank you.\nThe President. Great job, Jay.\nMy administration is working every day to make it easier for manufacturers to build, hire, and grow in America. We're removing job-killing regulations and lifting the burdens on American industry, like I would say have never been lifted before. We've done a lot of work over the last 60, 70 days, and I think you're seeing some real production.\nMaybe, I think we can say this, Mike—like never before.\nEarlier this week, I signed an Executive order to end the war on coal. We had coal miners up at the office. It was an amazing scene. You had very tough, very strong, very powerful men—they were crying, actually; and they were crying with happiness. And produce more American energy and more American jobs, which is how I got elected in the first place.\nWe've created the Task Force in every agency to eliminate wasteful regulations. And today at 3:30, with the Department of Commerce—Wilbur Ross will be up—and we're signing two very powerful Executive orders. It will be something very important—very, very special. And that will be with Commerce.\nOne of the reasons we're here today is to announce the extraordinary results of a new survey from the National Association of Manufacturers. Your survey shows that 93 percent of manufacturers now have a positive outlook on the future of their business in this country—93 [percent].* And it was, just a few months ago, 56 [percent].* That's a slight difference. [Laughter] That's a slight difference. That tells you something.\nThat's a 20-year, record high—highest it's been in 20 years, and it's going higher. Believe me, you could come back next month, Jay. [Laughter] I don't know how much higher it can go. And so I'm very proud of that, we're all very proud of that. And the manufacturers are really starting to invest big money, and a lot of things are happening. It's a new surge in optimism, which is sweeping all across our land. These survey results are a further vote of confidence in our plan to bring back jobs, lower taxes, and provide a level playing field for our workers. The manufacturing companies represent—and represented here today—are just an extraordinary group of people. They're leaders. They're brilliant in so many ways. The field has not been a level field. Jobs have been leaving our country, going to China and Mexico and lots of other places.\nAnd you'll be seeing what's happening over the next few weeks. It should be very interesting for you to watch. As you know, the President of China is coming to Florida. We're having a meeting—big meeting—at Mar-a-Lago. We call it the southern White House, which it actually is. [Laughter] It was originally built as the southern White House, a lot of people don't know. But it—sort of strange how it got there.\nBut it's going to be something, I think, very important, very special. I look very much forward to meeting him and the delegation, and we'll see what happens. But I am very, very proud of what you've been able to do in a short period of time—just this little, short period of time, the optimism is so high. And I see the billions of dollars that are being invested by your people and your representatives in plant and equipment and jobs.\nAnd I appreciate that, Jay, very much. Congratulations. You may want to say a few words.\nMr. Timmons. Well, I do. And I want to reemphasize for the media here that this quarterly survey of our 14,000 members has been going on for 20 years. And to the point you made, this was the highest level of optimism that our manufacturers have expressed in 20 years.\nThe President. That's fantastic.\nMr. Timmons. And the other statistic that I think you'll find interesting is the right-track, wrong-track question that our manufacturers answered. Just the month before Inauguration Day, the right-track number was only 26 percent. Today it is over 60 percent.\nThe President. Wow.\nMr. Timmons. So that's a huge growth as well. And that's because of the focus on taxes, regulations, infrastructure investment. We appreciate your commitment to investment in job creation and manufacturing. And we're going to deliver.\nThe President. Well, thank you very much, Jay. That's really nice.\nMr. Timmons. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Patricia, would you like to say something? Pretty outstanding what you've done.\nMatrix 4, Inc., Owner and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Miller. Thank you. I appreciate being here today. I own a plastics manufacturing company in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. We're a 3-year entrepreneurial startup in growth phase with a 40-year legacy. It's great to be part of manufacturing in the U.S. The President. That's great, and great job. You've done a great job. Really great.\nEd?\nApache Stainless Equipment Corp. President Ed Paradowski. Good morning, Mr. President. I'm Ed Paradowski, president of Apache Stainless Equipment. We're in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. We manufacture capital equipment out of stainless steel and other high alloys. We employ 175, and most of them are skilled trades people, some of the best skilled trades people in the State of Wisconsin. We are a 100 percent S Corp ESOP, and we would love to have you out in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.\nThe President. Well, I love the State of Wisconsin.\nMr. Paradowski. As do I.\nThe President. There was a little bit of an upset. I don't think it was an upset. [Laughter] I don't think—I thought we were going to do very well there. But people would—they would consider that a slight upset, right? But we don't consider it that. Thank you. Very good.\nMr. Paradowski. Thank you.\nThe President. Yes.\nStaub Manufacturing Solutions President Steve Staub. Mr. President, good to see you again.\nThe President. Thank you.\nMr. Staub. We enjoyed having you at our facility back in September. I'm Steve Staub with Staub Manufacturing Solutions in Dayton, Ohio.\nThe President. I remember.\nMr. Staub. And hopefully you got a chance to see the \"First Day\" video that we did with the National Association of Manufacturers.\nThe President. I did. Thank you. I did. Great job. Great—and you've done a great job.\nMr. Staub. Thank you.\nThe President. Yes.\nEagle Manufacturing Company President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Eddy. Good morning, Mr. President. My name is Joe Eddy. I'm the president and CEO of a company in northern West Virginia called Eagle Manufacturing. We're 125 years old this year, a family-owned business. We manufacture products out of steel and plastic. We make over a thousand industrial safety and hazardous materials handling products. And I bring from West Virginia a major thank you for your work you've done to support the coal.\nThe President. Great State. Great people. Really. We've really opened it up. Nobody thought we'd act that fast. They thought maybe at the end of a 4-year term, maybe I'd sign it—no. [Laughter] Nobody thought we were going to go that fast.\nMr. Eddy. You created a new hope—[inaudible].\nThe President. And the people appreciate it. No, we're going—it's going to—we're going to get it going.\nJulie.\nArbill Chief Executive Officer Julie Copeland. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. President. I am Julie Copeland. I am the CEO and co-owner, with my sister, of Arbill, a Philadelphia-based company that protects people in the workplace. I partner with manufacturers to make sure that no one gets hurt. We have products and services and technology. And it's a privilege to be here today in this sort of safety continuum.\nThe President. That's right. You're very safe. Would you say that? [Laughter] Ms. Copeland. Yes, we're safe all right. [Laughter]\nThe President. Very safe. Chuck. Thank you.\nMs. Copeland. Thank you.\nBTE Technologies, Inc., President Charles T. Wetherington. Good morning, Mr. President. Chuck Wetherington. I'm the President of BTE Technologies. We're based in Baltimore, Maryland and Denver, Colorado. We're a manufacturer of high-tech medical devices used in physical therapy and industrial rehab, and we also have a professional services business that focuses on workplace injury reduction.\nThe President. Good, good.\nMr. Wetherington. So, we are the safety corner here.\nThe President. That's very good.\nMr. Wetherington. And we work with large employers around the United States and Canada doing that kind of work.\nThe President. And you're starting to do really well again?\nMr. Wetherington. We are, yes. Thank you.\nThe President. That's good. That's great.\nAnd you know our great Vice President. [Laughter]\nMarlin Steel Wire Products LLC Chief Executive Officer Drew Greenblatt. My name is Drew Greenblatt. I'm the owner of Marlin Steel. We're a steel factory, we make wire baskets and racks for the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industry. We make everything in Baltimore city, Maryland. We import nothing. We use steel from Illinois, we use steel from Indiana. We're thrilled with the policies that you are pursuing. We're seeing great optimism, and we're thankful for the approach you're taking. And obviously—we're 45 miles from where you're sitting right now—we'd love for you to come visit us.\nThe President. Okay, good. Well, we're not finished yet, too. A lot of other things are happening, as good as you've had it.\nMr. Greenblatt. Just the beginning.\nThe President. You haven't seen this in 25 years. That's great. Thank you very much.\nNeenah Enterprises, Inc., President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Riordan. Mr. President, good morning. My name is Tom Riordan. I'm the CEO of Neenah Enterprises. We're a casting and forging operation in Neenah, Wisconsin, 145 years old. First products were plowshares back in the Civil War. Today, most of our products are either related to infrastructure in terms of street casting, sewer covers, and so on. The other half of our business is really tied to on/off-road vehicles, with folks like Caterpillar, Paccar, and John Deere. Which again, both are very much dependent upon your policies moving forward.\nThe President. Right, very good. Thank you. Good job, too.\nIMMY Inc. Chief Executive Officer Doug Magyari. Hi, nice to meet you. My name is Doug Magyari. I'm the CEO of IMMY, Inc. We're a Troy, Michigan company, suburb of Detroit. And we're very much a leading-edge research and development company on advanced technologies, and in particular, we've built the most advanced augmented reality and virtual reality glasses in the world. And it's an extremely important technology that's going to affect not only everybody at this table, but really every facet of our lives. And huge military applications and all sorts of medical applications, as well as entertainment.\nAnd it's such an important technology, that we've made a commitment to manufacture it here in the United States.\nThe President. Great.\nMr. Magyari. And we really appreciate what you're doing to help facilitate in making that happen.\nThe President. We have a lot of plants going up now in Michigan that were never going to be there if I—if I didn't win this election, those plants would never even think about coming back. They were gone.

Thank you. During the campaign, I traveled the Nation and visited the cities and towns devastated by unfair trade policies, probably one of the major reasons I'm here today—trade. Nobody has ever made bad trade deals like our country has made.\nI saw the shuttered factories and spent time with the laid-off factory workers. I heard their stories, and I promised them action, and I promised them a solution. And all over America, you're already seeing that solution start to take place. Take a look at what's going on Michigan, with Ford and General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, and so many more.\nThe jobs and wealth have been stripped from our country, year after year, decade after decade, trade deficit upon trade deficit—reaching more than $700 billion last year alone—and lots of jobs. Thousands of factories have been stolen from our country. But these voiceless Americans now have a voice in the White House. Under my administration, the theft of American prosperity will end. We're going to defend our industry and create a level playing field for the American worker—finally.\nToday I am signing two Executive orders that send this message loud and clear and that set the stage for a great revival of American manufacturing. And you saw that today; you saw what happened. You saw the kind of numbers we have. The survey actually showed 93 percent of manufacturers are now optimistic about the future—a record high—and that's up from about 56 percent just a couple of months ago. We're going to build on that tremendous momentum. And we're bringing manufacturing and jobs back to our country.\nFirst, I'm signing an Executive order to ensure that we fully collect all duties imposed on foreign importers that cheat. They're cheaters. From now on, those who break the rules will face the consequences, and they'll be very severe consequences.\nSecond, I am ordering the first-ever comprehensive review of America's trade deficits and all violations of trade rules that harm the United States and the workers of the United States, just as I promised during my campaign. This review will be led by Secretary Wilbur Ross, who is joining us here today. Wilbur is a outstanding success story, an unbelievable businessman, a great but very, very fair negotiator, and on Wall Street, he's simply known as Wilbur, and everybody knows him. And now we have him on our side. So I thank you, Wilbur. It's really—you're going to do a fantastic job.\nWe're going to investigate all trade abuses, and based on those findings, we will take necessary and lawful action to end those many abuses. I am not beholden to any political or financial interest. I don't care. I'm here to do a job. I'm doing a job for the American worker. I really don't care. I'm not thinking about my business or anybody's business. Wilbur isn't. Peter isn't. None of the folks that we have up here are. We're doing a job. It's an opportunity like nobody has ever given. And we're here to do a great job for the American worker and for our companies where the American workers are employed.\nI work for the American people. Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or belong to no party at all, you are an American, and I'm here to represent you and your family. We're going to get this thing straightened out. We're going to get these bad trade deals straightened out. Right, Peter? Director of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro. Yes, sir.\nThe President. It's time. You've been looking at it for years. Right, Wilbur?\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. Yes, sir.\nThe President. This combination over here, it can't be beaten.\nThat's why I defied the special interests and followed through on my pledge to withdraw immediately from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And that's why I am taking these very historic steps today. The well-being of America and the American worker is my north star. And these two orders will point out our Nation, and point to everybody, point to the world.\nNext week, as you know, in Florida, at the Southern White House, we're having the President of China and a large group from China as representatives. And we're going to get down to some very serious business. So we look forward to it. I've spoken to him numerous times on the phone. We look very much forward to it. But it's been very bad what's been happening to our country in terms of our companies and in terms of our jobs. So we're going to start turning it around. We're going to turn it around fast; it's not going to take a long time. It's going to go fast.\nSo I just want to end by saying that we have a team that's second to none. And when everybody is assembled and fully in gear after these two orders, I think it's going to be something very special. I'd like to ask Wilbur to say a few words, and then, Peter, you say a few words. And we're all set. Our Vice President—I think I'm speaking for both, but I'm not 100 percent sure.\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Yes, you are.\nThe President. I will tell you one thing: He has one hell of a good marriage going. [Laughter]\nCome on, Wilbur.\nSecretary Ross. Thank you, Mr. President. If anyone had any doubt about the President's resolve to fix the trade problems, these two Executive orders should end that speculation now and for all time. This marks the beginning of a totally new chapter in the American trade relationship with our partners overseas.\nThank you very much.\nThe President. Thank you, Wilbur. Peter.\nDirector Navarro. I remember well during the campaign the day the President made the speech outside of Pittsburgh and laid down a set of promises to the American people on trade. And today this is the beginning of the fulfillment of those promises in a grand way, with Wilbur Ross at the helm and the President being the grand strategist of this. And we're going to get it done for the American people, workers, domestic manufacturers.\nThank you.\nThe President. Mr. Vice President. Would you like to say something?\nVice President Pence. This is a great day for the American worker and a great day for the American economy. Once again, President Trump is keeping his word. As we look for ways to expand exports from this country, imports to this country, this President is determined that we're going to have free trade, but it's going to be fair trade. And arms-length negotiations with nations, holding them accountable to the promises that they make, and the review the President is initiating today and the work of members of this team on the President's behalf will ensure that we put America first when it comes to trade; we put American jobs and American workers first.\nThe President. All right, thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. You're going to see some very, very strong results very, very quickly. Thank you very much.

Policy. Importers that unlawfully evade antidumping and countervailing duties expose United States employers to unfair competition and deprive the Federal Government of lawful revenue. As of May 2015, $2.3 billion in antidumping and countervailing duties owed to the Government remained uncollected, often from importers that lack assets located in the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to impose appropriate bonding requirements, based on risk assessments, on entries of articles subject to antidumping and countervailing duties, when necessary to protect the revenue of the United States.\nSec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order:\n(a) the term \"importer\" has the meaning given in section 4321 of title 19, United States Code; and\n(b) the term \"covered importer\" means any importer of articles subject to antidumping or countervailing duties for which one of the following is true: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has no record of previous imports by the importer; CBP has a record of the importer's failure to fully pay antidumping or countervailing duties; or CBP has a record of the importer's failure to pay antidumping or countervailing duties in a timely manner.\nSec. 3. Implementation Plan Development. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, develop a plan that would require covered importers that, based on a risk assessment conducted by CBP, pose a risk to the revenue of the United States, to provide security for antidumping and countervailing duty liability through bonds and other legal measures, and also would identify other appropriate enforcement measures. This plan shall be consistent with the requirements of section 4321 and section 1623 of title 19, United States Code, and corresponding regulations.\nSec. 4. Trade and Suspected Customs Law Violations Enforcement. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, shall develop and implement a strategy and plan for combating violations of United States trade and customs laws for goods and for enabling interdiction and disposal, including through methods other than seizure, of inadmissible merchandise entering through any mode of transportation, to the extent authorized by law.\n(b) To ensure the timely and efficient enforcement of laws protecting Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) holders from the importation of counterfeit goods, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate steps, including rulemaking if necessary, to ensure that CBP can, consistent with law, share with rights holders:\n(i) any information necessary to determine whether there has been an IPR infringement or violation; and (ii) any information regarding merchandise voluntarily abandoned, as defined in section 127.12 of title 19, Code of Federal Regulations, before seizure, if the Commissioner of CBP reasonably believes that the successful importation of the merchandise would have violated United States trade laws.\nSec. 5. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop recommended prosecution practices and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecuting significant offenses related to violations of trade laws.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Policy. Free and fair trade is critical to the Nation's prosperity, national security, and foreign policy. It is in America's economic and national security interests to promote commerce by strengthening our relationships with our trading partners, vigorously enforcing our Nation's trade laws, improving the overall conditions for competition and trade, and ensuring the strength of our manufacturing and defense industrial bases.\nFor many years, the United States has not obtained the full scope of benefits anticipated under a number of international trade agreements or from participating in the World Trade Organization. The United States annual trade deficit in goods exceeds $700 billion, and the overall trade deficit exceeded $500 billion in 2016.\nThe United States must address the challenges to economic growth and employment that may arise from large and chronic trade deficits and the unfair and discriminatory trade practices of some of our trading partners. Unfair and discriminatory practices by our trading partners can deny Americans the benefits that would otherwise accrue from free and fair trade, unduly restrict the commerce of the United States, and put the commerce of the United States at a disadvantage compared to that of foreign countries. To address these challenges, it is essential that policy makers and the persons representing the United States in trade negotiations have access to current and comprehensive information regarding unfair trade practices and the causes of United States trade deficits.\nSec. 2. Report. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consultation with the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, and the heads of any other executive departments or agencies with relevant expertise, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR, shall prepare and submit to the President an Omnibus Report on Significant Trade Deficits (Report). To aid in preparing the Report, the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR may hold public meetings and seek comments from relevant State, local, and non-governmental stakeholders, including manufacturers, workers, consumers, service providers, farmers, and ranchers. The Report shall identify those foreign trading partners with which the United States had a significant trade deficit in goods in 2016. For each identified trading partner, the Report shall:\n(a) assess the major causes of the trade deficit, including, as applicable, differential tariffs, non-tariff barriers, injurious dumping, injurious government subsidization, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, denial of worker rights and labor standards, and any other form of discrimination against the commerce of the United States or other factors contributing to the deficit;\n(b) assess whether the trading partner is, directly or indirectly, imposing unequal burdens on, or unfairly discriminating in fact against, the commerce of the United States by law, regulation, or practice and thereby placing the commerce of the United States at an unfair disadvantage;\n(c) assess the effects of the trade relationship on the production capacity and strength of the manufacturing and defense industrial bases of the United States; (d) assess the effects of the trade relationship on employment and wage growth in the United States; and\n(e) identify imports and trade practices that may be impairing the national security of the United States.\nSec. 3.

In particular, American innovators have made ground-breaking advances in cancer research. These innovations help drive the declining rates of cancer mortality.\nStill, much work remains to be done. Cancer is still the second-leading cause of death in the United States and causes too much suffering for too many of our families and communities.\nDuring Cancer Control Month, we honor the memory of loved ones lost to cancer and we celebrate our cancer survivors. We recommit ourselves to developing cures for those currently battling this disease across the country and to educating people on the many ways they can prevent cancer and take care of those who have fallen ill.\nOur Nation is committed to winning the fight against cancer. Throughout April, we promote methods to combat cancer and we recognize the thousands of medical professionals, public health advocates, scientific researchers, innovative companies, and family members and friends who treat, find cures for, and support those suffering from all forms of cancer.\nMy Administration will continue to work with the Congress to implement the 21st Century Cures Act and clear the way for enormous breakthroughs in medical science. Cutting-edge research can transform cancer treatment, so that it is more effective, less toxic, and less debilitating. Together, we will make possible the medical advances necessary to prevent, treat, and defeat this disease.\nExperts believe that nearly half of the most common cancers can be prevented. Americans can reduce their risk of developing cancer through healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption. Regular physicals and cancer screenings and awareness of family medical histories are also critical to preventing cancers and helping those who fall victim to cancer discover it at earlier, more treatable stages.\nBecause of the toll cancer imposes on our citizens, families, and communities, as well as the importance of promoting prevention and early detection, my Administration wholeheartedly concurs in the request of the Congress, that dates back to 1938, to declare April as \"Cancer Control Month.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as Cancer Control Month. I call upon the people of the United States to speak with their doctors and healthcare providers to learn more about preventive measures that can save lives. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing Cancer Control Month.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Growing up in a loving home, with a nurturing family, surrounded by a safe community gives our children the best opportunity to realize their full potential. Sadly, mistreatment by parents, guardians, relatives, or caregivers all too often threatens children's ability to flourish. Abuse or neglect can rob children of their sense of dignity and worth, which are indispensable to the pursuit of happiness and success in the classroom, in the workplace, and in relationships. Children rightfully impose a moral obligation on adults, who must protect them from harm and preserve their opportunity to reach their full potential and achieve their dreams. They deserve nothing less. The dreams of our children are the future of this country.\nAs we observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to stop child abuse before it begins. That means preventing destructive conduct from shattering the secure and protective environments in which our children deserve to live, learn, and thrive. We must all be aware of the signs of child maltreatment and take appropriate steps to safeguard children by reporting concerns and connecting families with the help they may need.\nThe family is society's most important institution, and its impact on human potential is unmatched by any other influence that government, education, or even community can wield. We must promote strong families. By respecting and supporting parents, we will reduce risks and increase the safety and protection critical to our children's happiness and success. The best child abuse prevention program is a strong family with well-equipped, mature, and child-focused parents. We therefore celebrate the many community members who help parents fulfill their moral obligations by providing them a needed shoulder to lean on in troubled times.\nWe also honor foster and adoptive parents, child protective workers, faith leaders, community mentors, teachers, and law enforcement officials, whose tireless work every day protects children who have been tragically abused or neglected. Their often thankless service in these difficult and painful situations helps restore the safety and dignity of these wounded children and, in many cases, dramatically improves the course of their precious lives. As a Nation, we pledge to honor our commitment to protecting the vulnerable among us, not just this month, but every day of the year.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month.

During National Donate Life Month, we honor the living and deceased donors who gave so others could live, and celebrate the remarkable achievements of our healthcare and science professionals who perform transplants and create techniques to make the gift of life possible.\nWe also continue our efforts to raise awareness of the life-saving potential Americans have as donors. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network reports that 33,606 transplants were performed during 2016, which is an 8.5 percent increase from 2015.\nStill, additional donors are urgently needed. More than 118,000 people are currently waiting for organ transplants, and thousands of our family members and friends die each year waiting for matches. This month we remind Americans that people of all ages and from all walks of life can help save lives. Remarkably, one organ donor can save up to eight lives. One tissue donor can help 75 people heal.

One of my first actions as President was to issue an Executive Order entitled \"Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System,\" and its first core principle is that financial regulation should \"empower Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth.\"\nEmpowering Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices is critically important to our Nation's prosperity. Yet more than half of households today do not have 3 months of funds saved for emergency, and most families with children are not currently saving for college. In addition, a majority of working Americans worry about running out of money in retirement, and nearly a third of workers have no retirement savings at all.\nWe must address these challenges. Creating and implementing innovative financial education curriculums is critical. For example, the Department of Defense has made long -term financial security education opportunities available for our service members and their families. As a result, the men and women of the Armed Forces can plan a healthy financial future by seeking advice from personal financial managers and counselors.\nMy Administration will work with committed organizations in all sectors to improve financial education and share best practices so that all Americans—no matter their income, education, or background—have the capability to make sound financial decisions. Together, we will empower Americans to take advantage of the many opportunities they have to attain more financially secure and prosperous futures for themselves and their families.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

We dedicate each April to raising awareness about sexual abuse and recommitting ourselves to fighting it. Women, children, and men have inherent dignity that should never be violated.\nAccording to the Department of Justice, on average there are more than 300,000 instances of rape or other sexual assault that afflict our neighbors and loved ones every year. Behind these painful statistics are real people whose lives are profoundly affected, at times shattered, and who are invariably in need of our help, commitment, and protection.\nAs we recognize National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we are reminded that we all share the responsibility to reduce and ultimately end sexual violence. As a Nation, we must develop meaningful strategies to eliminate these crimes, including increasing awareness of the problem in our communities, creating systems that protect vulnerable groups, and sharing successful prevention strategies.\nMy Administration, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, will do everything in its power to protect women, children, and men from sexual violence. This includes supporting victims, preventing future abuse, and prosecuting offenders to the full extent of the law. I have already directed the Attorney General to create a task force on crime reduction and public safety. This task force will develop strategies to reduce crime and propose new legislation to fill gaps in existing laws.\nPrevention means reducing the prevalence of sexual violence on our streets, in our homes, and in our schools and institutions. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of changing social norms that accept or allow indifference to sexual violence. This can be done by engaging young people to step in and provide peer leadership against condoning violence, and by mobilizing men and boys as allies in preventing sexual and relationship violence. Our families, schools, and communities must encourage respect for women and children, who are the vast majority of victims, and promote healthy personal relationships. We must never give up the fight against the scourge of child pornography and its pernicious effects on both direct victims and the broader culture. We recommit ourselves this month to establishing a culture of respect and appreciation for the dignity of every human being.\nThere is tremendous work to be done. Together, we can and must protect our loved ones, families, campuses, and communities from the devastating and pervasive effects of sexual assault. In the face of sexual violence, we must commit to providing meaningful support and services for victims and survivors in the United States and around the world.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

We also recognize the importance of identifying ASDs early in a child's life and of understanding the obstacles faced by people living on the autism spectrum. Together, we celebrate the many ways individuals with ASDs enhance our daily lives and make priceless contributions to our schools, workplaces, and communities.\nAutism spectrum disorders affect an estimated one out of every 68 children in America. Individuals and families living with autism come from diverse backgrounds. These families face enormous challenges in assisting their loved ones over the course of their lifetimes. As those with ASDs reach early adulthood, families are often faced with even greater obstacles than during childhood, including planning for the successful transition into adulthood and independent life.\nWe are hopeful that our Nation's efforts will result in significant advancements related to autism diagnosis and treatments in the months and years ahead. Ongoing efforts to scan the human genome carry significant potential to better manage the disorder and, ultimately, find a cure. My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to implement the 21st Century Cures Act and help to clear the way for breakthroughs in medical science. Together, we will turn scientific discoveries into real solutions for people with complex health issues like autism.\nCutting edge therapies and lifelong treatments can impose enormous burdens and expenses on the families of people with autism spectrum disorders. I applaud the efforts by Members of Congress to enact tax-free savings vehicles for families of people with disabilities and ASDs. I also encourage the ongoing public-private efforts to develop new technologies to prevent wandering and keep individuals with ASDs safe.\nFor generations, men and women living on the autism spectrum have made extraordinary contributions in the fields of science, technology, art, literature, business, politics, and many other professions. Yet the world still has a great deal to learn about ASDs. We must continue our research to improve early identification and intervention, strengthen our comprehension of the disorder, and open opportunities for every member of our society to live independently and live the American Dream. My Administration is committed to promoting greater knowledge of ASDs and encouraging innovation that will lead to new treatments and cures for autism.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, April 2, 2017, as World Autism Awareness Day. I invite all Americans to Light it Up Blue, which Melania and I will do at the White House. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by those with autism spectrum disorders, and to do what they can to support individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.
