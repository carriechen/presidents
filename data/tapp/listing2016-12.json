{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119733", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:20 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. Before we go to your questions, I've got a little scheduling update for you.\nOn Tuesday, the President of the United States will travel to Tampa, Florida, where he will meet with active-duty servicemembers at MacDill Air Force Base, the home of the U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. While at the base, the President will have an opportunity to meet with uniformed leadership from both commands, as well as with some of the men and women stationed there.\nAmong those the President will meet with are members of our special operations community who, over the past eight years, have been a key element of our relentless pursuit of terrorists who had threatened the United States of America. The President will offer his personal gratitude and that of the nation for the professionalism, skill, and sacrifice of those American patriots.\nWhile in Tampa, the President also will deliver formal remarks on the counterterrorism strategy he's directed as Commander-in-Chief, including our strategy and the gains we have made while staying true to the values that have always been at America's core. The President has no higher priority than protecting the American people. And this speech will be a final opportunity for him to discuss at length how he has effectively, durably, and successfully implemented reforms to keep us safe. And we'll have some more details on the speech next week, and additional details about the logistics of the Tampa visit then as well.\nSo with that scheduling announcement out of the way, we can go to your questions. Darlene, do you want to start?\nQ: Yes, thank you. The sons of Ethel Rosenberg, the spy that was convicted 50-some odd years or so ago, were outside the\nWhite House about an hour ago to call on the President to exonerate their mother. They've sent some paperwork into the White House, asking the President to do that. Can you say what the status of their request is? Is it being considered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I only learned of this shortly before coming out here. I'm not aware of any work that has been done thus far in terms of reviewing their request, but it sounds like they may have just submitted it. So I'm sure we'll take a look, but I don't have any announcements or anything to preview on this matter.\nQ: Is there enough time left in the administration for that request to get a thorough review, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: It seems --\nQ: Or would that be something that would be passed on to the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, hard to say. I would -- I think it's fair to say that any action on this matter before the end of this presidency is unlikely.\nQ: Second, on Pakistan, would this White House agree with Donald Trump's description that Pakistan is \"amazing\" and that its citizens are \"one of the most intelligent people\"? That's the description the Foreign Ministry provided of the conversation that Donald Trump had with their Prime Minister yesterday.\nMR. EARNEST: Darlene, I saw the readout of the telephone call that you're referring to. I can't speak to the accuracy or to the tone of that phone call. I'd refer you to the President-elect's team for more of a description of what the President-elect may have communicated to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Obviously, President Obama's conversations with his counterpart in Pakistan have been an important priority. The U.S. relationship with Pakistan is one that's quite complicated, particularly when you consider our overlapping national security interests. The relations between our two countries, particularly over the last eight years, have not been smooth -- consistently smooth, particularly in the aftermath of the raid on Pakistani soil that President Obama ordered to take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield.\nBut this obviously is an important relationship. There have been areas where the United States and Pakistan have been able to effectively coordinate our efforts. But one of the things that I'm reminded of is that every President, regardless of which party they're in, benefits enormously from the expertise and service of thousands of patriotic Americans at the State Department. These are men and women -- some of them are career Foreign Service Officers. Some of them are just career civil servants. But these are individuals who are committed and passionate about serving our country and representing our country overseas, regardless of who the President is.\nAnd President Obama benefitted enormously from the advice and expertise that's been shared by those who serve at the State Department. And I'm confident that as President-elect Trump takes office, those same State Department employees will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the United States overseas. Hopefully he'll take it.\nQ: According to their readout, Donald Trump also said that he'd like to visit Pakistan. And I know President Obama has never been there.\nMR. EARNEST: Not as President.\nQ: Not as President. Is there anything you can say about why he never visited as President?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, at one point in his presidency, I do recall President Obama expressing a desire to travel to Pakistan. For a variety of reasons, some of them relating to the complicated relationship between our two countries at certain times over the last eight years, President Obama was not able to realize that ambition. But one thing we do know is that it sends a powerful message to the people of a country when the President of the United States goes to visit. And that's true whether it's some of our closest allies, or that's also true if it's a country like Pakistan, with whom our relationship is somewhat more complicated. But ultimately, when President Trump begins planning his overseas travel, he'll have a range of places to consider, and Pakistan would certainly be one of them.\nRoberta.\nQ: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the trip to Tampa. You had said that it's a chance for the President to -- a final opportunity to discuss at length his counterterrorism strategy. But I'm wondering if it's also an opportunity to sort of talk about anything left on his to-do list as he runs through the tape, as you say. Is it an opportunity for him to sort of lay out what he didn't achieve or something that he hopes to still accomplish in his remaining days?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have too much of the speech to preview at this point. I think the President on a number of occasions, particularly over the last couple of weeks at the variety of news conferences that he's convened, has acknowledged that he's proud of the record of success that we've demonstrated during his presidency, particularly in the area of foreign policy. But there are some objectives that we did not complete. And I'm confident that, in addition to listing off the numerous accomplishments and numerous reforms that we've successfully implemented, the President will certainly spend some time talking about the important work that remains to be done.\nQ: And when it comes to transition issues and the transition for the intelligence community, how is the White House feeling about how that transition process is going? Apparently there's only one member of the transition team named so far to deal with the intelligence community issues. And I just wonder if you could give us an assessment of any concerns you might have about the pace of that part of the transition.\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta, I haven't gotten a detailed update about the status of transition efforts in the intelligence community. What I can tell you is that from the Obama administration's perspective, we've been planning for the better part of a year to organize paperwork, organize briefings, prepare materials for the incoming administration. And that groundwork has been laid, and the President has made clear to his team that ensuring a smooth and effective transition is a top priority and certainly is a top priority for the 50 days or so that are remaining.\nBut I have not gotten an update on how it's been going with regard to conversations in the intelligence community. I think I'd refer you to them for the latest assessment.\nMichelle.\nQ: We're going to see this event today on the Carrier jobs announcement, and it's going to be this kind of presentation and celebration of that. And given the little that we know at this point about what was involved in that deal, do you think that it merits this kind of event, and is it worthy of a celebration at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as you heard me say yesterday, we obviously welcome the news. Once the details are released -- but based on what we know now, it appears that several hundred or maybe even a thousand U.S. jobs will not be moved overseas and that plans have changed. That's obviously good news and an announcement that we would welcome.\nBut, again, as I mentioned yesterday, Mr. Trump would have to make 804 more announcements just like that to equal the standard of jobs in the manufacturing sector that were created in this country under President Obama's watch.\nSo this is good news, but the incoming President has a high bar to meet when it comes to putting in place the kinds of economic policies that are going to benefit American workers.\nLet me give you one example: the overtime rule. And it's a poignant example because that was a rule that was scheduled to go into effect today, December 1st. This was a rule that President Obama announced earlier this year. But the bottom line is that every week there are millions of middle class Americans who work more than 40 hours a weeks but don't receive any pay for their extra work. There are 87,000 such workers in Indiana. By definition, these are the hardest-working people in America. And earlier this year, the administration finalized a rule to expand overtime protections to more than 4 million Americans -- something that would boost wages by $12 billion over the next decade. This is boosting pay for people who are, by definition, middle-class Americans and Americans who are working harder than just about everybody else.\nSo the way that this rule was implemented was that we modernized the way that the government calculates the salary threshold under which most workers qualify for overtime, and that essentially changed the threshold from $23,700 to $47,500, and indexed it to inflation going forward. And this would essentially ensure that people who were intended to be eligible to collect overtime pay could do so.\nUnfortunately, this rule was blocked just a couple of days ago by a federal district court judge in Texas. And that's unfortunate that you essentially had Republican governors colluding with some of the biggest businesses in America to prevent the hardest-working middle-class Americans from getting a raise. If anybody deserves a raise in this country it's middle-class Americans who are working overtime and not getting paid for it.\nSo hopefully this is the kind of thing that Democrats and Republicans would actually be able to work together to be able to implement. And I haven't heard what the President-elect has had to say about this, but the possibility is there may be 87,000 middle class workers in Indiana who may be interested in what he has to say about this, and another 134,000 workers in Ohio who are affected by this rule who may be interested in what he has to say about it as well.\nQ: But what does the administration think of the details that we know so far -- that it was millions of dollars in tax incentives to stay? And then I guess there are other pieces that we don't know of it.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, listen, I think at this point it's -- I think ultimately we'd have to rely on the executives at Carrier to explain why they made the decision that they did. But again, if we're talking about a thousand U.S. jobs that have been saved, we would welcome an announcement like that. But again, we'd need to see another 804 of them to equal the number of jobs in the manufacturing sector that were created in the United States under President Obama's watch.\nQ: So you're saying it's good but it's not that great? I mean, how would you kind of sum it up?\nMR. EARNEST: No, look, if you're a worker, or you live in one of the thousand families where that paycheck is being collected, then obviously that's welcome news. I'm not criticizing it at all. I think what I'm trying to highlight is, as you evaluate the strategy that's being put forward by the President-elect, I think it's worthy drawing a comparison to what was done in the last eight years under President Obama.\nAnd, if you'll indulge me, we talked a little bit about the Affordable Care Act earlier this week -- some metrics that you could use to judge the wisdom and approach that's put forward by the incoming administration with regard to health care reform. We've put together some metrics that you could use to judge the performance of the incoming administration's economic policy. And many analysts who have looked at the data have concluded that some of the rhetoric from the President-elect was critical to his success in winning the election. So I think people come in with some high expectations, so let's look at some metrics.\nThe first would be jobs. Under President Obama and under the strategy that we have implemented, our economy has seen the largest streak of total job growth in our nation's history. Over the last 80 months, we've created 15.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate has been cut in half from its peak that was reached back in 2011. So on the jobs front, President Obama has set quite a high standard, and one that will be a high bar for the next administration to live up to.\nThe second metric would be wages. So far, in 2016, we've seen wages grow at an annual rate of 3.1 percent. That's good wage growth -- not off the charts, but it's good. And we'll see if that's a rate that the policies of the next administration can continue.\nThe third metric is something that got a lot of attention during the campaign: Inequality. And what we know about 2015 is our country made historic progress in reducing inequality under the leadership of President Obama. We saw the median household income rise at the fastest rate on record -- $2,800 a year, or 5.2 percent. The largest gains were for middle-class and working families and for low-income households who, in 2015, saw their income rise almost 8 percent while those at the top saw their income rise less than 3 percent.\nSo we see a growing economy. We see wages and income growing for everybody in the country, but growing faster for those in the middle and at the bottom. That is important progress in reducing inequality, and certainly will be a high standard for the incoming administration to meet.\nJust two more. The fourth one is actually something that should be familiar to the President-elect and many of the people that he has nominated to his economic team, and that's just the stock market. Since President Obama took office -- let me be precise -- since the stock market reached its low in March of 2009, just two months after President Obama took office, the S&P 500 has more than tripled. That certainly means money in the pocket for a lot of people who invested in the market, and certainly a lot of money in the retirement accounts of a lot of middle-class workers who have been saving for their retirement and investing in the stock market. We'll see how the incoming administration performs based on market reactions to some of the policies they've put forward.\nThe last thing I would note is poverty. And in 2015, the number of people in poverty fell by 3.5 million. That is the fastest rate -- or fastest decline -- it's the fastest rate of decline since the 1960s. And that is a metric that the President is quite proud of. I haven't heard the incoming administration identify this as a priority, but President Obama certainly believes that fighting poverty and reducing poverty is a priority. And on his watch, last year, the poverty rate fell faster than it has in 50 years.\nSo this is an economic track record that President Obama is proud of. I think it is a clear illustration of the smart strategy that we have implemented. The President-elect is preparing to take office vowing to overhaul that strategy. We'll see if the reforms that he's promising work as well as with the Obama administration has been able to achieve.\nAnd again, I could understand why the stories that you may be working on today may not have room for all of this data, but at some point in the future --\nQ: Well, if you could say something about the dollar as well -- maybe, about the strength of the dollar. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the incoming Treasury secretary comment on that. But I will -- at some point, there will be some senior economic official for the Trump administration standing up here talking to all of you about the success of their economic strategy, and hopefully you'll draw upon some of the notes from this conversation and ask them about it.\nQ: All right. And just one more thing -- I'm sorry --\nMR. EARNEST: No, I should apologize for the long answer, but I appreciate --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I will.\nQ: Fifteen more questions. (Laughter.) Okay, so Pakistan read out this phone call with Donald Trump, and they included direct quotes, saying in part, \"You have a very good reputation. You're a terrific guy. You're doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.\" So does this -- given the meetings that we've seen and the ways that they were conducted, as well as the phone calls and the contacts that have been made with foreign leaders, do you think that this signals a different kind of engagement around the world? And does the administration have concerns so far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I mean, what you have read from is a readout that was put out by the Pakistani government reflecting a conversation and reflecting the words chosen by the President-elect. So I just don't have a lot of insight into either of those things.\nSo what I can say is that President Obama benefitted from the professionalism and expertise of career diplomats at the State Department who were able to offer him good advice about engaging with world leaders. And every President has benefitted from that advice, and I think that President Trump would certainly benefit from it in the same way that President Obama did when he took office.\nGo ahead, Julianna.\nQ: Thanks. Just to follow up on Michelle's question about the tax incentives that were offered to Carrier as part of this deal, does that raise any concerns in the White House that it sets a standard that other companies can say we're going to ship jobs overseas to Mexico, and think that they can extract economic incentives?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it's hard to tell at this point exactly what was driving Carrier's decision. I've seen a lot of speculation. Some people have speculated that it was the promise of improved -- \"improved\" is probably not the right word -- the promise of federal taxation policies that would benefit Carrier. I know there's been some speculation that Carrier was threatened based on the defense contracting business that they have with the U.S. government. There's also been some reporting to indicate that Carrier's decision was actually driven not by any federal-level decisions, but by decisions that were made at the state level, potentially by the lame-duck governor of Indiana who also happens to be the Vice President-elect of the United States.\nSo there's a lot to unpack here. Ultimately, I think the executives at Carrier, if they choose to do so, will have to explain the decision that they made. I think the point that you are raising, though, Julianna, I think is a legitimate one, which is, what is the most effective strategy for ensuring that the United States continues to be viewed by countries and companies around the world as an attractive destination for investment. And we have seen foreign direct investment in the United States increase under President Obama, because a lot of companies and countries recognize all of the advantages that are present or that exist in the United States -- from our workforce, from our infrastructure, to our education system, to an environment that makes innovation possible.\nAll of that has been part of our strategy. And the strategy under the Obama administration, as I just laid out, I think has served the American people, American workers and the broader U.S. economy quite well. We'll have an opportunity to measure whether or not the results stack up for the kinds of reforms that President Trump is promising.\nQ: Are there concerns, though, that they've set up a moral hazard?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the strategy that the incoming administration is promising to use is very different than the strategy that we have pursued. And I think there is ample evidence to indicate that the strategy pursued by the Obama administration is one that yielded great economic benefits for the country. But President Trump won an election vowing to do it differently, and we'll have an opportunity to evaluate his approach based on the facts. And they've got a lot to measure up to, and it looks like we'll have an opportunity to do that.\nHans.\nQ: You'll soon be in the private sector -- to go back to the wage growth issue. Do you expect -- based on what we're learning about the new Treasury Secretary, or potential new Treasury Secretary, do you expect to pay -- or wealthy Americans to pay a higher or less overall tax burden?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, even some of the rhetoric that we're hearing from the incoming administration is difficult to discern. During the campaign, I know that the President-elect vowed to raise taxes on people like him. And just yesterday, his incoming -- the individual that he intends to nominate to be Secretary of the Treasury indicated that there would actually be no change in the net tax that's paid by higher-income Americans.\nSo, look, I think the fact is that they're still formulating exactly what their policy is going to be. And when it comes to tax reform, we know that ends up being complicated business because it has to move through the United States Congress too. Again, one of the things that I did include on here was tax policy, but you could certainly include in here the wisdom of the approach that President Obama has pursued in terms of locking in, making permanent tax cuts for middle-class families while asking those at the top to pay a little bit more. And that's had a positive impact on our economy, a positive impact on job growth, a positive impact on broader economic growth, a positive impact on reducing the deficit, and had the benefit of making our country just a little bit more fair.\nSo the kind of approach that President Obama has pursued I think has been a good one, and the facts bear that out. But it sounds like we'll have an opportunity for another President to come in and suggest a different approach. But we'll have a chance to see how it stacks up with the approach put forward by the Obama administration.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you have someone that -- Jason or one of your staff send out those notes you just sort of rattled off, those economic notes? I'd appreciate that.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: On the Carrier thing, I know you probably were just making the point that you all had a great deal of success in your approach economically, but I think some people are wondering if you were kind of taking a shot when you said, well, he's going to have to do it 800 more times -- sort of get to where we are. Given the sensitivity of the people on the ground who are very worried and very concerned about losing their jobs, did you want to walk that back a little bit?\nMR. EARNEST: No. Because, again, I certainly am not doing anything other than welcoming the announcement from Carrier that stands to benefit, potentially, a thousand workers and a thousand families in Indiana. That's good news. I don't have anything bad to say about it.\nI think the observation is just a coherent strategy will be required to ensure that people all across the country can enjoy the benefits of a particular economic strategy. And the economic strategy we have put forward is one that saved actually more than a million jobs in the manufacturing sector, and created another 805,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector.\nSo, again, I think, if anything, I'm suggesting that the success of the incoming administration in protecting those manufacturing jobs is something that they're going to have to aggressively ramp up if they want to meet the standard set by the Obama administration. Just a little rough math would indicate that if President Trump is fortunate enough to serve two terms in office for eight years, he's probably going to have to average about two of these announcements a week every week of his eight-year presidency in order to meet the same standard. So the bar is high, but he'll have an opportunity to try it his way and we'll see if it works.\nQ: I want to ask you about the Rolling Stone interview. And I don't want to make more of this perhaps than some people might. The President was talking about the untenable nature of this sort of patchwork of having marijuana laws. You got Colorado and Washington, there's a new one in California, in Massachusetts, and then other states have medical marijuana provisions. He's not suggesting -- or I'm going to ask you, is he suggesting that there needs to be a federal standard when it comes to the management of marijuana law?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what the President is suggesting is that it's increasingly difficult for federal law enforcement officials to be enforcing the law differently in a variety of states. And as we see more states change their laws with regard to marijuana, it makes it more challenging for federal law enforcement officials to enforce the law. So that's something that I think the next administration is going to have to grapple with and certainly law enforcement officers in the next administration and some policymakers are going to have to sort of consider what's the most effective way to move forward here. I don't think the President at this point was trying to signal any specific policy change, but rather just indicating that this is an increasingly complicated situation that is facing federal law enforcement officers.\nQ: I want to ask you also about something the incoming President-elect has said about regulation. He's actually -- well, two parts. First of all, is the President engaging in sort of any midnight regulations push between now and when he leaves office? And I guess the second part of the question would be, given that the President-elect has suggested that for every new regulation maybe we ought to take away two others -- and I've heard the President himself suggest that this regulatory environment is cumbersome, to say the least -- does he agree that this might be a useful way to go about cleaning up regulatory policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I can tell you that the regulatory work that's being done in this administration is not going to be characterized by a last-minute rush on the way out the door. I think what it will be characterized by is a continuous and persistent effort to complete the work that's already been started. And that is to say that there are a number of rule-making actions that were commenced earlier this year that haven't yet been completed. And we will be working to complete them on schedule before President Obama leaves office, but these are -- in every case that I'm aware of -- rulemaking actions that began before the outcome of the election was known.\nAnd the President's view is that that's actually a smart way to make rules and make regulations. It also is a smart way to effectively implement them and ensure that they have the maximum intended benefit.\nWith regard to this idea of taking away two for every rule -- taking away two rules for every new rule that's initiated, that's the kind of thing I think that probably sounds pretty good on the campaign trail but may be a little bit more complicated when you implement it. And the reason I say that is not because the President is against eliminating regulations. In fact, President Obama has actually presided over a regulatory lookback proposal that has resulted in the elimination of a substantial number of regulations with a substantial economic benefit. We can get you the particular numbers.\nSo we've been engaged in a regulatory lookback to take away rules that don't make sense anymore -- that are outdated, that are unnecessarily cumbersome -- because I think people have an expectation that, to the extent that government is involved in some aspects of the economy, they shouldn't be posing an unnecessarily high burden to companies or to private individuals. And that's certainly something that has been an important part of the regulatory lookback process.\nBut I think the point is, is that each of those rules that are considered for repeal should be evaluated on the merits and shouldn't just be evaluated because somebody decided to create another rule in another place.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple times you've been asked about the calls between the President-elect and the leader of Pakistan. You've mentioned that there are career diplomats at the State Department who are able and willing to help the President get ready for those types of discussions. Is that to be read as some kind of a tacit criticism of Trump for not taking advantage and talking to the State Department before making several calls to world leaders?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I can't speak to any conversations that the President-elect may have had with the State Department. It's possible that he was briefed by the State Department before that call. I just -- I don't know, you'd have to ask them.\nI think I'm just making the observation that there are dedicated experts, public servants at the State Department that have years of experience that they have amassed and that they're prepared to use to advise the incoming President. And President Obama benefitted from that expertise, and I'm sure that President Trump will, as well.\nQ: I also wanted to ask you about -- there's been a letter sent by seven Democratic senators on the intelligence committee basically saying that the President should declassify some of the intelligence regarding Russian interference with the election. Has the President received that letter? Is that something that you're considering?\nMR. EARNEST: I've been briefed on the letter. I don't have a sense of what the status is of responding to that letter. Obviously, in advance of the election, the intelligence community released a letter to the public presenting their own analysis and some of the conclusions that they had reached about the efforts of the Russians to use some of their tools in cyberspace nefariously to try to undermine confidence in our political system. And that's something that we talked about quite a bit in advance of the election.\nBut if there are additional details that these members would like to have declassified, then I'm confident we'll take a look at it, but I wouldn't hazard a guess at this point about what kind of response they would receive.\nQ: I have just one more of the JASTA legislation -- the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, yeah. I remember that. (Laughter.)\nQ: Seems to be coming back in the news as Senator Graham --\nMR. EARNEST: It does, doesn't it?\nQ: -- and Senator McCain are offering an amendment or a change to that legislation.\nMR. EARNEST: Hmm. Offering a change to a piece of legislation that they passed. And then when the President expressed some concerns about it, they passed it anyway over his objection. Then the President, recognizing that this was going to be a problem, vetoed the bill. And these same members, knowing that these problems existed, still overrode his veto. And now, two months later, are trying to figure out how they can clean up the mess they created. That's the bill, right? (Laughter.)\nI'm sorry to do that to you, Toluse. I couldn't resist.\nQ: Yeah, so --\nQ: This is Jeopardy. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I know, it's good. This is really good.\nQ: Has the White House reviewed the changes that are being offered up? And are they sufficient to basically get the President's support?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've obviously been in regular communication with members of Congress for months -- first warning about the flaws in that bill, and then after the President's veto was overridden, despite their full knowledge of the flaws in the bill, we've been working with them to try to put together some changes to the bill that would address the significant concerns that we've raised.\nI don't have an update for you on those conversations, but I can confirm for you that they've been ongoing since shortly after the veto override vote. And I guess you can tell from my tone that we obviously would welcome congressional action to clean up the rather significant mess that they've made.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Okay, so we're nine days away from a government shutdown -- you know, the usual. And wondering if you would support a -- (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, where is the optimism in the room today?\nQ: -- support a CR in May, which is what is now being discussed on Capitol Hill.\nMR. EARNEST: And so what's the question?\nQ: Would the President sign a CR that would go through to May, which is something that's being discussed on Capitol Hill?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are discussions about a number of different proposals, and I think there might be -- this is a situation that we have seen before where there might be some disagreement between Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate, and they're going to need to do some work to try to resolve those differences. Hopefully, they'll do that work mindful of the need to work with congressional Democrats and mindful of the need for a Democratic President to sign it into law.\nWith regard to the specific question about the timing of a CR, I would actually refer you to a letter that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has sent to senior members of Congress expressing his profound concern about the possibility of a CR that extends through May.\nHe's concerned that that would hamstring the ability of the Department of Defense to initiate a number of programs that are critical to our national security. And he continues to be concerned that the kind of funding that would be provided under essentially a long-term CR would limit the resources that are available to the Department of Defense for the important work that they need to do to wage the counter-ISIL campaign, to follow through on some of the promises that we've made to enhance the support that we provide to some of our European allies in countering Russian aggression. I think there's also a concern about the funding stream that would be available to resource the military commitment that we've made to Afghanistan.\nSo the concerns that he's raised are quite significant and the concerns that he's expressed are shared by the Commander-in-Chief. So this is something that my colleagues at the Department of Defense have conveyed to members of Congress. And I hope that members of Congress will take very seriously the responsibility that they have to adequately resource our men and women at the Department of Defense who are doing work every day, putting their lives on the line, to keep us safe. It seems like the least that congress could do would be to just pass a budget and make sure that our men and women in uniform have what they need to keep us safe. That's a basic responsibility of the Congress. It is one that Republicans in Congress have shirked far too often. And the election is over. Now would be a good time for Republicans to set aside politics and just focus on the best interest of the country. And passing a CR that extends through May would be inconsistent with that kind of approach.\nQ: And would that also apply to other -- the government at large? How bad would it be to have a CR through May?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, our most prominent concerns are at the Department of Defense. There are other concerns other places. There's a reason that Congress is tasked with passing the budget every year. And passing a budget on time for a year gives the United States government the certainty that it needs to plan effectively and make sure that the interests of the American people are being well-served.\nPassing a budget resolution for two or three months at a time is not a very good approach. So we're hopeful that if Congress does have to pass a CR, that it's a short one so that they can get back to work after the holidays and actually pass one through the remainder of the fiscal year.\nObviously, the ideal would be for them to pass a budget through the remainder of the fiscal year. But given that that budget deal is unlikely to be forthcoming, we're hopeful that they will be able to come back after the start of the year and do that rather quickly, and not wait until May.\nLana.\nQ: A Russian diplomat says that the Kremlin is talking directly to the President-elect's transition team about Syria. What does the White House think of that?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any conversations that they may be -- that may be taking place on that matter. I know that the President-elect's team has given voice to the principle that you've heard me cite on a number of occasions, which is the United States of America has one President and one Commander-in-Chief at a time. And Barack Obama will be the President of the United States until January 20th, at which point he'll hand off that awesome responsibility to the President-elect. And it will be his responsibility to determine an effective path forward.\nI think it's been widely chronicled that the President-elect has been engaged in some conversations with world leaders, but the descriptions of those calls have primarily been social calls and him returning congratulatory calls that he received in the aftermath of the election. But, again, for greater insight into the potential substance of those conversations, I'd refer you to the President-elect's team.\nQ: Tell us about the insight -- because I don't expect you to know what the President-elect is saying with the leaders in the Kremlin. But does that concern the White House? Does it feel like they're going around sort of diplomatic protocol?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there is this principle that I think is important for everyone to acknowledge, and the President-elect's team has acknowledged it. And I think it's been reflected in a lot of the statements and actions that they've taken over the last three weeks, which is that there's one President of the United States at a time. And right now, at this time, Barack Obama is the President of the United States, but on January 20th, we'll do the transition.\nAnd it's important for everybody in the United States to understand that that principle is being observed by both the President and the President-elect. It's also important for people around the world to understand that that principle is operative. So, again, it's hard for me to render a judgment one way or the other without knowing the content of the conversations. And as we discussed, I just don't.\nQ: Bernie Sanders called the Carrier deal \"corporate welfare.\" Does the White House disagree with that assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, at this point it's hard to tell exactly what kind of deal has been brokered between --\nQ: Seven million dollars from Indiana.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, there's some indication that it was the promise of a federal benefit that may have actually changed their mind. It's just hard to tell what exactly swayed them. It's also hard to tell exactly what they were offered. It does appear that they were offered a substantial economic incentive by the lame duck governor of Indiana, who is also the Vice President-elect of the United States. And these kinds of state-based incentives are something that states will often do to try to compete for business. But I'd refer you to Indiana about the wisdom of the approach that Governor Pence has elected to pursue.\nQ: We spent a lot of time earlier this week talking about phone calls between the President-elect and the President. Have there been any more?\nMR. EARNEST: If there have been, I will not be the one to announce them.\nQ: What about with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Any calls that have occurred beyond the one that we talked about that happened on Election Night?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. But again, if those kinds of calls took place, we'd likely keep them private.\nQ: And yesterday, Senator Chuck Schumer invited the defeated Democrats in the Senate to have lunch with him. Would we expect that -- or are there any plans that the President might do the same with his former Secretary of State?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any social plans that they have at this point, but if that changes we'll let you know.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Earlier you said that this would be the final opportunity for the President to talk about his terrorism strategy. Do you also expect this to be his final domestic trip? And could we expect to see another major policy speech from him before he leaves office on January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't rule out additional domestic travel in January, but we'll keep you posted.\nQ: And as far as another at least major speech -- I understand that that would fall under that, as well. But even here at the White House, do you have any plans for additional major policy speeches, particularly in other areas?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing to announce right now, but stay tuned.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to follow up on Toluse's question about the intel committee and the Russian hacking. The Democratic senators said in their letter that they were conveying specifics through classified channels to the White House. And you said you'd been briefed on this. Can you confirm that the White House has received whatever sensitive information they have?\nMR. EARNEST: I can confirm that we received the letter that they sent over. I can't speak in any detail about the contents of the package that they sent over. But we'll do what we always do, which is we'll carefully review and consider the request from those senators. But at this point, I wouldn't predict what kind of response they'll receive.\nQ: Senator Shaheen today renewed her call for congressional hearings into the subject of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Does the White House support that and look at whether Russia was deeply involved in trying to meddle with our election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think ultimately this will be a decision for Congress to make. I don't think we'd weigh in one way or the other. But obviously Congress has legitimate oversight over these kinds of questions, and I know that the intelligence community in particular takes seriously the responsibility that they have to maintain an open line of communication with relevant congressional committees. I know that's something that Director Brennan and Director Clapper and other leaders in the intel community and in the Obama administration have taken quite seriously.\nSometimes there have been some disagreements -- some rather high-profile disagreements between leaders in the intelligence community and some members of Congress. But given the nature of that work and given the fact that in most cases significant public transparency is not possible, that kind of congressional oversight is particularly important when it comes to confidential or even classified matters.\nSo this administration has obviously taken seriously the need to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight in this area. Hopefully the next administration will, as well.\nQ: Can you say, is it still the White House's view that the integrity of the election was not compromised?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we have said is that the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security did not observe an increase in malicious cyber activity on Election Day from the Russians that was directed at disrupting the casting or counting of ballots. I think if that is something that had occurred, we probably would have spent a lot more time talking about it over the last three weeks. Fortunately, it did not. So that's the conclusion that we've put forward.\nBut look, what was true before the election is that there was a conclusion that was reached by the intelligence community that there were a variety of malicious efforts undertaken by Russia in cyberspace that were aimed at trying to disrupt, to destabilize, or shake the American people's confidence in our political system. And that's not an insignificant matter, and it certainly was treated quite seriously and has been treated quite seriously by this administration.\nQ: Just one more thing. Your answer just now sort of implies to me that there was -- that you don't really take the Senate Democrats complaints seriously because you've already established that there really wasn't any meddling. And so do you think the Senate Democrats are just motivated by partisanship here?\nMR. EARNEST: No. And I don't mean to leave you with that impression. We'll certainly take quite seriously the concerns that they've raised and the request that they have made, and we'll take a close look at it. We just received the letter today, so I just can't predict at this point exactly what kind of response we will provide them. But we'll certainly take it seriously. And this is a matter that the United States government takes quite seriously.\nOur political system and our democracy is at the foundation of our Constitution and it is at the foundation of our ability for the people of the United States to govern themselves. So this is a very serious matter. I think in those opportunities that the President had to discuss this matter publicly, I think he indicated just how serious it was. I recall him being asked about this when we were in China, I believe, and he indicated that he had raised, more broadly, concerns about Russia's activities in cyberspace and the way some of that malicious activity had had an impact on the United States.\nSo if this is -- if these are the kinds of issues that are coming up between the U.S. President and the Russian President, then I think you can assume that the U.S. President certainly takes them quite seriously.\nScott.\nQ: On the overtime rule, has the administration decided yet whether you're going to use the remaining 50 days or so to appeal the Texas ruling?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Justice for more details about our legal strategy. But I can tell you that everybody across the administration feels quite strongly not just of the wisdom of this approach, but in the legal basis for the decision that was announced earlier this year.\nQ: Are you going to rely on the incoming administration to advance that argument in the courts? Or are you going to make that argument to yourselves?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the observation -- whether or not we'll make that argument in the Obama administration is something you can ask the Department of Justice. But you've raised exactly the point that I was trying to make, perhaps too subtly in talking to Michelle about it. Much was made in the aftermath of the election about how middle-class workers -- blue-collar workers -- supported the Republican nominee based on his promise to shake up Washington, D.C. and ensure that their views were represented. He had a rather -- a variety of colorful expressions for doing this -- \"draining the swamp.\"\nAnd I assume this is part of what he meant -- making sure that the hardest-working middle-class Americans are treated fairly. Right now, 4 million of them are not. Four million of them work overtime but aren't paid for it. That costs their families $12 billion over the next 10 years. That's a lot of money for a middle-class family. There are, as I mentioned, 87,000 such worked in Indiana, and another 134,000 such workers in Ohio.\nSo, presumably -- and the only reason this is not moving -- it should be moving forward today, December 1st. It's not because of an injunction that was granted by a federal district court judge in Texas. And that injunction was granted to some large businesses and Republican governors who had colluded to try to disrupt the implementation of this rule and essentially continue to take advantage of more than 4 million of the hardest-working Americans.\nSo this seems like the kind of thing that, for all the profound differences between the President and the President-elect on policy, this seems like something they should be able to agree on. But we'll see.\nQ: And the presidential finding today that any relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel should wait another six months. Can you just talk about the thinking behind that?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, this presidential determination was issued today consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act. This is a piece of legislation that was passed back in 1995 that essentially called on the United States -- essentially mandated that the United States President move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But that legislation included waiver authority, essentially giving the U.S. President the opportunity to issue a waiver and delay that move. And that waiver has to be invoked every six months, and that's something that President Obama has invoked every six months of his presidency over the last eight years.\nAnd the reason for that is simple: It has long been U.S. policy that the final resolution of Jerusalem is something that should be determined between the two parties through face-to-face diplomatic negotiations. And that's been a policy of U.S. Presidents in both parties, but we'll see what policy the incoming President chooses to pursue.\nGregory.\nQ: I have another question, but I want to follow up on that. What would be the consequences of failing to issue that semi-annual waiver and moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in almost every case -- and maybe it's true in every case -- that the U.S. embassy in a foreign country is located in that country's capital. And obviously a formal, concrete action by the United States signaling our determination that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel would be highly controversial and could be viewed by many, not just in the region but around the world, of the United States making it harder for the two sides to resolve the status of Jerusalem through negotiations.\nThe United States is -- again, this has been the policy not just of the Obama administration, but of Democratic and Republican administrations since 1995. And it's actually -- it was a policy before then, but was less relevant because the bill was passed in 1995.\nSo I wouldn't predict exactly what the consequences would be, but that is the concern that we've heard Democrats and Republicans in the White House express for more than 20 years now.\nQ: Second question. The President visited Walter Reed on Tuesday. We're told that he met with 13 soldiers and awarded the Purple Heart to 12 of them. Is that something that the President does routinely, directly awarding Purple Hearts?\nMR. EARNEST: I know it's something that he's done routinely when he's visited Walter Reed, and I know that there have been other occasions where he's been able to offer those kinds of military honors to our men and women in uniform.\nQ: Can you give us any insight as to what kinds of capacities those troops were serving in and in what theaters?\nMR. EARNEST: I can look. We often will -- let me see if there's additional information on this that we can provide to you.\nQ: You talked about the President's visit to MacDill next week. Last time he was there was in 2014, which he said the American forces that have been deployed to fight ISIL do not and will not have a combat mission. And you've addressed this a number of times. But if we are not engaged in combat operations, how is it that American troops are being injured due to hostile fire?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, this is something that we've discussed a lot and it's important for people to understand exactly what the President's approach is here. And it's simply this: The men and women in our military that have been sent to Iraq and Syria to participate in the counter-ISIL campaign are being sent to some of the most dangerous places in the world. They are being sent to an area where there's a war being fought. And these men and women in our military put themselves in grave danger to train, and equip, and advise, and assist those forces that are taking the lead in fighting for their own country.\nOur country has borne a significant burden by pursuing a policy in which the Commander-in-Chief deploys a large-scale, protracted ground combat presence to go fight a war somewhere else for some other country, and to occupy that territory and defend it until that country is prepared to fight for itself. That strategy didn't work. That was basically the strategy that was put forward by the Bush administration in 2003 when they invaded Iraq, and we're still, to this day, dealing with the consequences of that poor strategy.\nThe strategy that President Obama has pursued is a different one, and it's a strategy that envisions working closely with Iraqi security forces to equip them, to train them, to offer them advice, and to offer them assistance so that they can go and fight for their own country. And Syria's situation is more complicated because we're not able to work with the host government. That host government has lost legitimacy to lead that country, so we're training, and equipping, and advising, and assisting opposition fighters there all against ISIL -- a terrorist organization that threatens the United States and our interests.\nAnd the wisdom of this approach is that it puts fighters at the front of fighting for their own country, but it does not eliminate the risk that is facing our servicemembers. It's a smaller number of U.S. servicemembers that are facing that risk, but they're still assuming a grave risk. So the men and women who are sent into Iraq and Syria are trained for combat, they are equipped for combat, and there are some situations where they've encountered combat situations.\nAnd in some of those situations, those servicemembers have given their lives. In some of those situations, those servicemembers have been wounded. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude because they are doing the dangerous work to protect America and to protect our freedom. And President Obama pays tribute to that service in a variety of ways, including by traveling to Walter Reed once a quarter to visit with those servicemembers, to visit with their families, to check on their recovery, and occasionally to award them military honors.\nBut it's important for people to understand that the mission that President Obama has given them is different than the mission that President Bush gave many more U.S. servicemembers. But the mission that they've been given by President Obama is one that's dangerous and, in some cases, requires them to pay the ultimate sacrifice. And it's why we are deeply indebted to them.\nSo thanks for giving me the chance to give a long answer.\nJohn, I'll give you last one.\nQ: Thanks. The Senate, very shortly, is expected to pass the Iran Sanctions Act. Is the President satisfied with what lawmakers have come up with? Will he sign that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll take a look at the bill once it's been passed. What I can tell you is that many members of Congress have indicated they strongly support this legislation because they believe the administration should have authority to impose financial penalties against Iran.\nAnd what I can tell you is that the administration retains and has used substantial authority to impose sanctions against Iran because of a ballistic missile program that is inconsistent with U.N. Security Council resolutions, because of their ongoing support for terrorism, and because of the willingness of the Iranian government to routinely violate human rights.\nSo this administration has repeatedly imposed financial penalties and imposed sanctions against Iran because of that behavior. We've got plenty of authority and we're not shy about using it, but we'll take a look at the bill that's been passed by Congress and we'll let you know what the President decides to do with it.\nQ: Also, Senator Heitkamp is headed to New York to meet with the President-elect tomorrow, possibly to talk about a Cabinet position. In any of President Obama's conversations with the President-elect, did he recommend Senator Heitkamp or any other Democrat for a Cabinet position?\nMR. EARNEST: Any personnel recommendations that the President may have offered were recommendations that he made confidentially. So I'll protect his ability to offer some private advice and counsel to the President-elect whenever the President-elect seeks it.\nThanks, everybody. Have a good rest of the day. We'll see you later.\nEND 1:25 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-12-01", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Eva Longoria, thank you for the wonderful hosting. Kelly Clarkson, we love. To everybody who is here tonight and everybody watching at home, it is now officially the time to light this tree. [Applause] Are you guys ready to count down? We're going to start from five. You ready? You sure? Ok, let's go. Five, four, three, two, one! [Applause] Hey! Merry Christmas, everybody!\n[At this point, the President exited the stage. He later continued his remarks as follows.]\nMerry Christmas, everybody! Well, thank you, Dylan, for that introduction and for all that you do for our parks down in Texas. I also want to thank Reverend Haggins for her beautiful invocation. And as we continue to celebrate the centennial of our national parks, I want to recognize our tremendous Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell; our National Park Service Director, Jonathan Jarvis; and all the rangers and staff from the Park Service and the National Park Foundation. Here's to another 100 years.\nLet's give it up for Eva Longoria and this star-studded group we have here performing tonight: gold medalist Simone Manuel, Kelly Clarkson, Yolanda Adams, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, Chance the Rapper, the Lumineers, Marc Anthony, James and Kim Taylor. It's like a Christmas edition of Lollapalooza. [Laughter]\nAnd this is just another example of why the holidays here at the White House are so special. Last week, I pardoned a turkey. [Laughter] Tonight we're lighting the National Christmas Tree. This one is easier because a tree does not move. It does not gobble. [Laughter] You just push a button, and it's electrified, which is exactly what you don't want to have happen at a turkey pardon. [Laughter] I thought that was funny, Michelle. [Laughter] Thankfully, both events have gone off without a hitch.\nAlong with celebrations like these, the holidays also offer us a time for reflection and perspective. And over these next few weeks, as we celebrate the birth of our Savior, as we retell the story of weary travelers, a star, shepherds, Magi, I hope that we also focus ourselves on the message that this child brought to this Earth some 2,000 years ago, a message that says we have to be our brother's keepers, our sister's keepers; that we have to reach out to each other, to forgive each other; to let the light of our good deeds shine for all; to care for the sick and the hungry and the downtrodden; and of course, to love one another, even our enemies, and treat one another the way we would want to be treated ourselves.\nIt's a message that grounds not just my family's Christian faith, but that of Jewish Americans, Muslim Americans, nonbelievers, Americans of all backgrounds. It's a message of unity and a message of decency and a message of hope that never goes out of style. And it's one that we all need very much today.\nAfter 8 years as your President, I still believe that there's so much more that unites us than divides us. I've seen it in parents from every corner of this country just trying to give their kids a better shot. I've seen it in communities that come together and find common ground even in times of trial and times of tragedy. We see it in immigrants and refugees striving for that most American of ideals: to better ourselves and our families. We see it in our troops who serve far from home during this holiday season, these outstanding men and women who go into harm's way to protect the Nation that we love and the freedoms that we hold dear: the freedom to vote and speak out and practice our faiths as we choose, the freedom to chart our own course as citizens and as a nation.\nThat is the America that I've seen as we've come back from the depths of an economic crisis to an economy on the move, as we've recovered from wars and natural tragedies. What I've seen is a big-hearted and hopeful and resilient people who look out for each other and who have each other's backs and who find strength in our differences and who keep moving forward knowing that we're all in this together.\nThose are our values. That is who we are. That's who we will always be. And this is the 94th time that Americans have gathered to light our national tree. It's the eighth and final time for our family. Before we leave tonight, I just want to express what an incredible honor it has been to serve this Nation and to feel its warmth and to feel its generosity and how our family has been awed by America's goodness. And most of all, it has been so special to share these 8 years with all of you.\nSo on behalf of Michelle and Malia, Sasha, Grandma—[laughter]—Bo, and Sunny, Merry Christmas, everybody. Happy holidays. May God bless you all, and may God bless these United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-12-01", "title": "Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree"}

Some of the victims were just beginning careers of service, while others had devoted decades to those around them. The brutality of the attack's perpetrators could not have been in starker contrast to the selflessness and generosity that characterized those taken from us.\nIn the year since this tragedy, we have mourned those we lost, just as we have continued to confront the violent ideology behind this attack as well as the terrorist groups, including ISIL, that propagate it.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119841", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:20 P.M. EST\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. I apologize for a late start. The last thing I want to do is delay your weekends.\nQ: You always look at me when you say that. (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: We won't discuss your weekend plans, Mark.\nTwo quick announcements right off the top. One is a personnel announcement. A lot of people in this room, on both sides of the podium, tend to get a lot of credit when we're in front of the cameras; there's a lot of limelight on both journalists and those of us who speak on behalf of the administration. But sometimes the hardest-working people are those who work behind the scenes. And I know that NBC has a professional here whose last day is today. Al Harvey will be leaving us after 30 years of service. (Applause.)\nSo I think everyone in here knows that Al is a true professional, and someone who makes us look and sound great. And we appreciate your service. You're here day in and day out, so we thank you. And best wishes from everyone here at the White House.\nQ: He needs to --\nMR. SCHULTZ: What's that?\nQ: He needs to do a little more work -- (laughter) --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yeah -- right. (Laughter.)\nIn similarly upbeat news, today we learned that, in November, the U.S. economy created 178,000 jobs, extending the longest streak of total job growth on record. As we've discussed in this room many times, upon assuming office the President took bold action to help rescue and rebuild our economy. As the President's time in office nears its end, I thought it would be useful to look back at eight years to the jobs report directly following the election of the President in December of 2008.\nIn December of 2008, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent and was rapidly climbing on its way to 10 percent. Today, the unemployment rate, according to today's report, is at 4.6 percent, the lowest unemployment rate in more than nine years. In December 2008, we lost 695,000 jobs. Today, our economy added 178,000 jobs. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. economy was shrinking at an annual rate of 8.2 percent. Today, our economy is growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Great. Thanks, Eric. Let's start with the announcement of the President's support for having women register for the Selective Service. The timing is a little curious, given that there is this debate going on in Congress right now about the Defense Policy Bill and whether to include that in the bill. It's currently not in the version that the House voted on.\nIs the President hoping to influence that debate about that bill or to signal that he would not sign a Defense Policy Bill that doesn't have that provision included in it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Josh, I appreciate the question, because it is an important issue. And the President does believe that the military is strongest when we draw from a pool from all eligible recruits, irrespective of gender. So the President values the service of all men and women who comprise our all-volunteer force.\nAnd if you look at the brave men and women who serve our country now in uniform, they've all proven their mettle in missions around the world, including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nWe remain committed to an all-volunteer force that meets the highest standards of performance that applies equitably to all those who serve and that sustains a strong legacy of public service. I think the draft registration is a vivid reminder to our nation's youth about the value of public service, and that as old barriers get removed, the President supports women registering for the Selective Service.\nAs you point in your question, Josh, this is now a question for Congress to resolve. I'm not sure, to be honest, if they will address this in the NDAA. My understanding is that there is some language in the NDAA that touches on this, but basically just said they're going to continue to look into it.\nQ: Last night, a number of Clinton aides, including former\nWhite House Communications Director Jen Palmieri, said that the Trump campaign had given a platform to white supremacists during the election. Does the White House agree with that assessment?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I saw reporting on this forum in Cambridge last night. And as you know, typically this is an opportunity for the strategists from both sides of each of the campaigns to debrief over a hard-fought campaign. This is an opportunity to learn from both sides, hear from the people who are key decision-makers about the decisions they made. Sometimes they take the opportunity to reevaluate decisions that they made in real time, with the benefit of hindsight. Sometimes we learn about moments that they thought were more significant at the time than they were, and sometimes it's the opposite. But there's value in these types of discussions. It's not something that I'm going to be able to engage in from here.\nBut that analysis, again, has value. I know that obviously historians will look at it, scholars will look at, journalists will look at it. So it's an important conversation to have; it's just not one that we're going to engage in from here.\nQ: And then two quick foreign policy questions. Will the President block the Chinese government, Fujian Grand Chip, from taking over Aixtron?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I've seen some reporting on this. As you know, there's a codified process in place for evaluating deals like this, so we don't comment on them publicly from here. But if you have questions on the CFIUS process, those are best directed at the Department of Treasury.\nQ: And Iran's government is saying that the renewal of the sanctions explicitly violates the JCPOA and that they'd have to be forced to respond if it were implemented. I know that it's the administration's position that it doesn't violate it. But it sort of doesn't matter what you guys think as much if the Iranians believe it does and can use that as cover to pull out of the deal and say it's because the U.S. violated it. So, first of all, can you say whether the President intends to sign it? And second, are you concerned that the Iranians may use this as an excuse not to continue with the deal even if that doesn't comport with your assessment of what this piece of legislation does?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. We have long said that extending the Iran Sanctions Act was unnecessary. And to the contrary, our focus has been on our key objective of the continued successful implementation of the Iran deal.\nWe believe the Iran Sanctions Act extension is not necessary, but we also believe it won't interfere with the Iran deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that was agreed upon between Iran and the P5+1.\nSo I would expect the President to sign this piece of legislation. As you know, inside that legislation it includes a provision to allow the Secretary of State to waive relevant nuclear-related sanctions as consistent with both the legislation and our commitments made under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. So that's something we've been doing since implementation day, and that's something we'll continue to do under our obligations of the deal as long as Iran keeps up its end of the deal, as well.\nBroadly speaking, as long as Iran adheres to its commitments under the Iran deal, we're going to as well. But we should also make clear that our concerns about Iran's other destabilizing activities in the region -- like support for terrorism, their ballistic missile program -- our concerns about those activities haven't waned. We haven't been shy about taking action in response to those actions. That includes strong, robust sanctions, and that's not going to change.\nJeff.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. Does the White House have a reaction to President-elect Trump inviting the Filipino President Duterte to the White House next year, particularly given sort of the friction in the relationship between President Obama and President Duterte?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jeff, as I think you are referencing, we have expressed concerns with a lot of the inflammatory rhetoric from President Duterte recently, and I believe just last night President Duterte delivered remarks which could be seen as taunting additional extrajudicial killings.\nSo that's something that's inconsistent with the values that we try and promote around the world -- values that include basic human rights. Obviously, the Philippines is a country that has a long tradition of a vibrant civil society and universal freedoms, but this doesn't take away from our longstanding history and shared traditions with the Philippines' people. Obviously, we work very closely together on maritime cooperation. We have rich people-to-people ties. And our trade between the two countries is robust.\nSo obviously, it's going to be up to the next President-elect to decide which foreign leaders he meets with, so we're going to leave it to him to make those decisions. But obviously, it carries a certain amount of weight when the President travels abroad to visit his counterparts around the world, and similarly, it carries weight to invite a foreign leader to the White House.\nQ: The President declined to meet with President Duterte on a recent foreign trip where they were both planning to meet. Do you see any irony in that declination being followed up by the President-elect setting this meeting for next year, or for whenever?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jeff, again, it's going to be up to the next President to decide which foreign leaders he meets with in which sequence. Again, it carries a lot of significance when the President of the United States decides to travel to a foreign country and meet with a head of state or one of his counterparts.\nSo those decisions are made with an understanding of the complexities of bilateral relationships and regional relationships around the world, so those decisions are not made lightly here. But similarly, decisions to invite a foreign leader to the White House, to the United States, aren't made lightly either. So those will be decisions the President-elect will have to make, so we're not going to cast judgment on those.\nQ: There are some recounts going on, as you know, in three states. Supporters of President-elect Trump have started some legal challenges to prevent those recounts from continuing. What's the White House's position on whether those should continue?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I saw that. And I think that because of those challenges, this is now subject to ongoing litigation. So I'm going to be under some constraints about how much I can offer. I can tell you that here at the White House, we're focused on our institutional responsibilities to provide for a seamless transition of power. The President set the tone for that transition just 36 hours after the polls closed when he welcomed the President-elect to the Oval Office.\nSo we are focused on that. Obviously, the state officials in Michigan will have to focus on this recount question, and we expect that question to be resolved there.\nQ: And finally, with just not too much time left before the President leaves office, can you shed any light on what his plans are after January 20th? Has he gotten a book deal put together? Does he have any teaching gigs lined up? What's the outlook?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I think the first order of business, which he has said publicly, is he is going to take his wife on vacation. I think that's a commitment he made that he plans to follow through on. Beyond that, I think that a lot of those plans are still getting worked out. As you know, there will be a foundation that is stood up that continues a lot of the work of his public service, if you take -- from a higher altitude -- if you look at the values that he's championed and the work that he's tried to do as President, but also just as a public servant, and as a leader in this country.\nSo I think that the foundation will be a place where a lot of those goals continue to be worked on. So I don't have a whole lot of details right now to announce. But I suspect in the coming weeks and months, you'll hear more about their mission and how they plan to fulfill it.\nJoe.\nQ: Eric, is there anything more on the letter from Senator Wyden and six other Democrats? It essentially says additional information about Russia's attempts to interfere with the United States election are being kept secret. Is the President going to do what his fellow Democrats want him to do?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Joe, we addressed this a little bit yesterday. We received that letter. We acknowledge receipt of that letter. I don't have any update on the response.\nAs you do know, it's been several weeks now -- maybe over a month -- where the United States government's intelligence community did announce that it had determined an intent by Russian officials -- senior Russian officials to try and interfere in our elections. That was an announcement that was made by the intelligence community in conjunction with the FBI and law enforcement. That was an announcement that was released publicly at the time.\nSo if Democrats on the Hill are looking for more information along those lines, the process of seeing if we can declassify more information along those lines will follow a similar process and a similar track to when the IC originally decided to make that determination public.\nQ: But is that process fast, is it slow? Is it something that could be done before January 20th?\nMR. SCHULTZ: To be honest with you, I'm not sure. I know that we just got the letter yesterday, so I'm sure that the right folks here and at the appropriate agencies are taking a look. So if we have a response to that, we'll make sure we get it to you. But we just got it yesterday.\nQ: I think probably the 30,000-foot view for the American public is the question of whether the election was actually affected by Russia's attempts. Can you give us anything on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, what I can give you is two things. One, like I mentioned, the intelligence community determined, I think --\nQ: They were trying.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Right -- middle of October, I think, is when this determination was released that Russian officials were trying to interfere with our election. We also know that -- from our Department of Homeland Security and our collaboration with states -- that we did not notice any increased intrusions or malicious cyber activity on Election Day. So in terms of the actual cybersecurity and the actual sort of integrity of those systems where votes are cast and counted, we did not notice any increased malicious cyber activity on November 8th.\nQ: Another area. What is the administration's position on the idea of military personnel being appointed to head DOD within seven years after leaving military active duty? It apparently can come up with the person the President-elect has said he might nominate --\nMR. SCHULTZ: I was going to say, you're just randomly asking our position on this? (Laughter.) Look, President Obama has been clear that Donald Trump won the election and he's going to have the latitude and space he needs to appoint the people that he thinks are fit to lead this country, and that includes members of his Cabinet.\nGeneral Mattis is someone who served our nation with distinction. He was commander of U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, so about three years that overlapped with President Obama serving as Commander-in-Chief. The President is grateful for his leadership and his counsel. And so the question of whether a recently retired military officer should serve as the Defense Secretary is one that the next administration and the next Congress is going to have to address.\nQ: Is it a policy issue that this administration ever considered when proposing a possible DOD Secretary? Did somebody get knocked out because of this law?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's actually not a policy or a custom. It is a law. It's in the statute. And it's important to keep in mind that the Defense Department is the single largest institution in the world. Three million Americans report to the Defense Secretary. U.S. military and civilian personnel are stationed in over 100 countries around the world. They have a budget of nearly $600 billion. Recent Defense Secretaries include scientists, business leaders, CIA director, congressmen, senators. So some have had military experience; some haven't.\nBut again, we're not going to be in a position to cast judgment on the President-elect's team. The specific question about this waiver will be determined by the next Congress and the next administration.\nMark.\nQ: Back to cybersecurity. I guess the President's commission that's going to be issuing its report later today. Do you know if the recommendations that are contained in that -- is the President going to embrace some of these right away? Is he going to be acting on them? Is there time to act on them in the remaining weeks of the administration?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's a great question, Mark. And, yes, the President will be meeting with the commission's chair, Tom Donilon, later this afternoon. I think the two will discuss in the Oval Office how we, as a country, can build on both the commission's work to enhance our cybersecurity over the coming years and take a look at what's been working and what needs more improvement.\nSince you've studied this, you know that in February of this year, the President directed the creation of a nonpartisan commission and charged it with assessing the current state of cybersecurity in our country, and recommending bold, actionable steps that the government, private sector and the nation as a whole can take to bolster cybersecurity in today's digital world.\nSo I don't want to preview their report for you or our response. I can commit to you that we will make sure that that report is public. We'll also make sure that our response on that report is public, so you guys have a chance to judge for yourselves.\nBut, look, the President has made clear that cybersecurity is one of the greatest challenges we face as a nation. That's why this administration has consistently made cybersecurity a top national security and economic security priority. And that's reflected most recently in the fiscal year 2017 budget, which called for a 37 percent increase in cybersecurity resources. One would think that Congress would act on that budget request; it hasn't to date. So hopefully a lot of the rhetoric we hear from Congress about wanting to make sure our cybersecurity is improved can be translated into some action.\nQ: Is there other things that the President is going to be able to do over the next numbers of weeks?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't want to get ahead of what's in the report. I think we'll be able to get that out to you later this afternoon. But this isn't something the President plans to take his eye off the ball on. So if there are actionable pieces in that report, recommendations that we can do over the next 50 or so days, I wouldn't rule out the President acting on those.\nBut I also think that this problem isn't going to get solved in the next 50 days. It's not a challenge that is stagnant. It's a challenge that morphs and turns, given the way technology is developed these days.\nSo I think this is absolutely going to have to be a challenge that the next President takes on, as well as the next Congress.\nQ: Is there any coverage that we're going to get?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think it's going to be a closed, private meeting in the Oval Office.\nQ: What time?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have the time, but later this afternoon.\nKevin.\nQ: I want to ask you a couple of questions. Most notably, I want to get your take on this refugee story that you may have heard about. Australia apparently is turning back a number of refugees that were set to be headed to the island, and now there is reporting that they'll be making their way here to the United States. There's been some concern on the Hill as well about the usefulness of this particular approach, to say nothing of the vetting process. Can you give me an update on why the administration feels like this is a good example of opening our doors, if you will, to refugees who are in need of a place to go?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I appreciate the question, because the United States is proud of its long history as the largest refugee resettlement country in the world. As the President has said, our refugee resettlement program has grown considerably in the last year -- that's under the President's direction. He feels it's an American value to take care of some of the world's most vulnerable populations. And the U.S., as you're referencing, has agreed to consider resettlement from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, for refugees now living in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.\nWe engage all countries to find durable solutions for refugees. The President believes that it's important that we do that. But to your question about screening and security, the President also believes that his chief priority is to keep the American people safe. That's why the screening for refugees is the highest level of scrutiny anyone coming into the United States is subjected to. So that includes security checks with the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, multiple intelligence agencies.\nThe safety and security of the American people is our top priority, but the President believes that doesn't mean -- that doesn't detract from the President's goal to make sure that we are caring for the world's most vulnerable populations. Those are not mutually exclusive goals, and we can safeguard the American people while also providing refuge to the world's most vulnerable populations.\nQ: I think there are a number of people, Eric, who would wonder if, given the President-elect's posture on this particular circumstance as it relates to making certain that the people that might be coming to this country are not only vetted properly but also have proper placement, is of great concern to congressional lawmakers. Would you cede the point that, especially from their perspective, this would seem to fly in the face of the tone and tenor of the way things are going on the Hill right now?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I can't speak to the tone and tenor of the way things are going on the Hill right now. All I can say is, one of the principles that we have -- that we believe in and adhere to, and as does the President-elect, is that we have one President at a time. So this was a decision and an announcement that I believe was made either in late October or early November. So we have one President at a time. The Commander-in-Chief, this President, sets the policies. The President-elect, Donald Trump, will set the policies once he takes the oath of office.\nBut in terms of the screening, I want to assure you that, again, this is a population that is subject to the highest level of scrutiny of anyone trying to enter this country. We work closely under the President's direction with our Department of Homeland Security, our intelligence community, and other relevant agencies to increase capacity to conduct security screening over the past year. DHS has deployed additional officers to interview applicants; they conduct exhaustive screenings. And I should also add that the burden is on the refugee to show evidence that he or she will not be a threat. So we don't just take anyone's word, and we don't -- it's not the absence of evidence that allows us to approve someone. A refugee has to proactively show that they will be safe here in the United States.\nQ: Can you tell me if the President had an occasion to speak with French President Hollande since his announcement yesterday? And if so, can you give me sort of a readout of what that conversation was like and if there are any concerns that the sort of growing populism that we're seeing has percolated in places like the UK and perhaps, you could argue, here in the U.S. is now spreading to France?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, I don't believe the President has had a chance to phone President Hollande in the past day. I know that they were able to catch up in Berlin a few weeks ago; I know that you were on that trip as well.\nLook, generally speaking, everyone here at the White House appreciates President Hollande's service as the President of France. Under his leadership, France has responded courageously to horrific terrorist attacks and been an indispensable partner to the United States in our shared struggle to defeat ISIL and all terrorist groups.\nUnder President Hollande's leadership, France hosted the COP-21 conference on climate that's brought together nearly 100 -- nearly 200 countries to be the first-ever deal of its size and scope to help combat climate change. So President Hollande has been a trusted partner and friend to the American people. I wouldn't be surprised if President Obama has a conversation with President Hollande in the coming weeks. But I don't have anything to read out to you now.\nQ: And last is -- can you give me an update on the comings and goings over Gitmo, where we are right now? Do you have any transfers to announce? I know the President -- he's made it clear that he would like to close it. That's not likely to happen, obviously, but he certainly is doing his best to empty it along the way. Where are we on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, I don't have the numbers in front of me right now, but we can get you those. You are right that the President has established this as a priority, to close the facility at Guantanamo Bay. One of the stumbling blocks -- well, the principal stumbling block to this has been the United States Congress. And, in fact, the National Defense Authorization Act hasn't come up yet in this briefing, but I have a feeling it will, and there's a provision in there that continues to prevent the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\nWe believe that's a misguided provision, but we're not the only ones. President George W. Bush, Republicans in Congress, Republican experts outside of Congress have all said that this facility should be closed. So we share that goal. We wish that more members of Congress did, as well.\nThank you, Kevin. Stephanie.\nQ: Thank you. How does the administration feel about President-elect Trump essentially hitting the trail again on a victory tour, thank-you tour? In the past when this has been done by past Presidents -- a long time ago, Woodrow Wilson, George Bush 43 -- they were pushing an idea, but Mr. Trump is essentially trying to thank folks. How does the administration feel about that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You've done more history studying on this than I have. I think that -- look, President Obama has spoken a lot about how much he likes to get out of Washington, the bubble of this campus, and meet with folks. So sometimes that takes the form of crowd events, sometimes that's small roundtables, sometimes that's interviews or conversations or panel discussions.\nSo President-elect Trump is going to have four years at least to get out with the American people and engage them. So I don't think anyone here begrudges the next President for similarly trying to get out of the bubble here and be with the American people.\nQ: But since he hasn't been here yet, do you think this is a bit early, or is this how he should be spending his time -- kind of hitting the trail again in a rally-style event?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Look, that's going to be up to him to decide. I don't think anyone here is going to cast judgment on how the President-elect is choosing to spend his time.\nObviously, there's a lot of work to be done. We, actually, inside the administration have been preparing for this transition for over a year now, and the President-elect, obviously for the better part of 2015 and 2016, has been on the campaign trail. I know that they have dedicated a team to prepare for the transition. Obviously, that's a more fulsome, all-encompassing effort on their part. So I'm sure they're making decisions based on -- decisions on the President-elect's time as they see fit.\nQ: And what advice did President Obama have for the incoming United Nations Secretary-General about working with President-elect Trump? Did the Secretary General express any concerns about any of Trump's comments on refugees, climate change, anything like that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Stephanie, that's a fair question. I don't have any of the private exchange to read out to you. I do know that obviously the President was able to speak to all of you in the Oval Office to give some of the contours of their conversation. Obviously, Secretary-General-Designate Guterres is assuming a role of enormous consequence and awesome responsibilities for around the world.\nSo he's someone who's well-qualified for this post, but it comes with significant responsibilities. And the President wanted to make sure that he had a chance to touch base to, A, thank Mr. Guterres for his service thus far -- obviously, he's done a lot of work around the world, but specifically on this refugee problem. And so it's hard to think of someone more qualified to be in this position, given the complex challenges facing the international community right now.\nQ: And last question. Two Republican senators wrote President Obama a letter last night urging him to implement a hiring freeze on all career civilian servant positions except those in public health or safety between now and the end of the administration. They also want him -- in this letter, they say they want him to stop the practice of \"burrowing in\" in which political appointees become converted to career civil servants in order to keep their jobs under a new administration. I'm sure you know what that is. They say these steps would prevent outside people from being hired or the folks already under this administration staying on board -- basically, people that might try to undermine the policies of President-elect Trump. Is President Obama open to this idea of implementing this hiring freeze?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Stephanie, I saw a story about this letter. I assume the signers are the same Republican senators who didn't want the President to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court.\nAs the President has remarked, Republicans in the United States Congress have been trying to debilitate the President from doing his job for four and even eight years now. So we're going to do this by the books. That's been the President's directive as we've been preparing for this transition of power, so I don't have any personnel announcements like that to make right now. But I can tell you that the President takes this responsibility seriously. That's why he himself welcomed the President-elect to the Oval Office just a day or two after the election, and that helped set the tone for the entire administration -- that he clearly did not support Donald Trump in the election. He had profound disagreements with both a lot of the rhetoric, a lot of the policies, and the direction that Mr. Trump wanted to take this country.\nBut Mr. Trump won the election. And so now it's up to us to make sure that we provide for the seamless transition of power. And as the President said in the Rose Garden the day after the election, this was an intramural sport; that as Americans, we all support our President. So that's work that we have been doing for, again, the better part of the year, but it's ramped up now to make sure that the transition team is getting the information they need in order to take their place without a gap. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. Thanks.\nBob.\nQ: Eric, it's that time of the year again. Christmas carols are being sung. Menorahs are being polished. And the government runs out of money in a week. Where do you stand on these negotiations for the continuing resolution? Are you actively involved, et cetera? Where do we stand right now?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. We stand at a place that is, unfortunately, all too familiar -- that Republicans have once again failed to fulfill their basic responsibility of government. Probably very high on that list when you get to Washington and you're elected a member of Congress is figuring out a way to pass a budget that is responsible, that funds critical national security, that grows our economy, and that gives certainty to the agencies that carry out each of those duties.\nInstead of passing another short-term extension, Republicans should actually do their job. They should pass funding bills that adequately fund our national and economic security, adhere to the framework of last year's bipartisan budget deal that increases spending, should be equally divided between defense and non-defense spending, and free of ideological provisions.\nSo our belief is that if Congress does have to pass the CR, that they should get back to work early next year and pass a budget that governs the country for the year.\nQ: Are you willing to accept the March 15th, I guess, what's being kicked around the House right now?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I know there's a lot being kicked around both chambers of Congress. I know this is one where Republicans in the House might not be seeing eye to eye with Republicans in the Senate. We've seen that movie before; it doesn't usually end well.\nBut, look, as they negotiate this they should be mindful of a couple of things. One is, there are strong Democratic voting blocs in both chambers, and there's a Democratic President who has to sign this budget. So we believe they should get to work, they should roll up their sleeves and get this done.\nThanks. Olivier.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. You mentioned the Guantanamo concerns. That's not going to stop him from signing the NDAA, though, is it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, we have pointed that out as a concern in that piece of legislation. As you know, I think this was just released about 36 hours ago. So it's 3,076 pages, so we're still looking at it. That's one provision in there that concerns us. But we continue to review it. There are some things in there that are encouraging. It's mostly free of the budgetary gimmicks that Republicans have deployed in the past. These are gimmicks that sort of risk the safety of our servicemembers and undercut stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars. So we're going to continue to study it. Again, we got it about three days ago now, so we'll take a look.\nQ: And then, back in 2013, at the National Defense University, the President said it was time to get America off of permanent wartime footing. And now, it appears he's going to hand that permanent wartime footing off to his successor. How bummed out is he about that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Olivier, what are you doing on Tuesday? You should join us in Tampa. I think the President is going to address, for the past eight years, his work in the national security space. He believes that he's kept his promise to keep America safe and to advance our interests around the world. So I think the President is going to address this very question on Tuesday. He's going to talk about the progress we've made and, quite frankly, some of the unfinished work. So he'll be addressing that directly on Tuesday in Tampa, and we invite you to join us.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. I sound like a travel agent.\nToluse.\nQ: Eric, you had mentioned earlier that General Mattis served with distinction. There were some reports when he left Central Command back in 2013 that he was fired without even a phone call from the White House. Can you react to those reports and talk about whether that's true?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yeah, I haven't seen -- I've seen some of the reporting on this from that time. I don't have a vivid tick-tock of the chronology. But I do think that at the time, the President and the administration and the Secretary of Defense did say that General Mattis served with distinction. So we're proud of his service. We're grateful for his service. He's someone who provided not only this country, but this administration and this President, with tremendous counsel and wisdom. So I don't have -- I don't know of anything to second-guess that.\nQ: I also wanted to ask you about -- there's an upcoming referendum in Italy on Sunday. Obviously, Europe has gone through a lot of turmoil with these types of votes. What's the message of the President to the Italian people? And does he think that Prime Minister Renzi should stick around if he loses that referendum?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I know that Prime Minister Renzi has addressed that second part of your question, so I'm going to leave that to him.\nLook, this is a decision for the people of Italy to make. As you point out, this referendum is on Sunday. I know they'll be voting then. Generally speaking, the President is supportive of Prime Minister Renzi's reform agenda. He makes some compelling arguments about why the government there could be more functional if it's streamlined. So again, this will be a decision for the Italian people, and we'll let you know if we have a reaction once the results are in.\nQ: On the unemployment numbers, some critics of the President's record have pointed out that the labor force participation rate has actually gone down in the last month. What's your reaction to that, the fact that fewer people seem to be looking for jobs?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I have a couple reactions to that. One is, if you look at the long-term trends of the numbers we've gotten, the growth and the sustainability and the strength of our economy is undeniable. We've seen the longest streak of total job growth on record. Businesses have added 15.6 million jobs over the last 81 months. Since its peak during the recession, the unemployment rate has been cut by more than half, and now stands at 4.6 percent. So, similarly, we've seen wage growth accelerate in recent years, and so far, in 2016, wages have grown 2.7 percent at an annual rate.\nSo that's not to say that the job is done. But that is to say that the President is enormously proud of our record. He's proud of the decisions he made, quite frankly, early on in this administration, some of which were not very popular, some of which were subject to criticism from the President's political opponents, saying we shouldn't rescue the auto industry, we should let them fail, or the Stimulus Act wasn't going to do any good, or that it was too expensive.\nSo I think the results speak for themselves, and the President is proud of his record on this.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. Just a couple of brief things. First, the President-elect -- you made some pretty strong suggestions about businesses in the future that would close their plants in the United States and move to overseas. And this seems at odds with the traditional Republican philosophy of the free market and leaving private enterprise alone to make its own decisions. What's the White House's official opinion on that policy?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think it's no question that if you look at the rhetoric from the campaign of this past season, that the President-elect and the current President have vastly different views on how to grow the economy. We believe that the economy grows best when you grow it from the middle class out, when you invest in things like infrastructure and schools and reducing health care costs.\nSo, again, we believe that record speaks for itself. The data is in. We are able to sort of judge the decisions that the President made -- again, many of them unpopular and controversial at the time -- but we're able to judge them now with some history and some data intact. So you'll have to talk to the President-elect's team about his approach. I know that while running for office, he said that people like him in his income bracket should pay more, should incur a heavier burden for the tax system. We'll have to see. I know they're still putting together their policies for their administration, so we'll have to see how that manifests itself once they're in office.\nBut again, in terms of the President's approach, which are things like investing in our schools, investing in education, infrastructure, lowering health care costs, lowering the deficit, and making sure that U.S. manufacturers have the resources they need to not only build the best goods and services worldwide, but also ship them overseas, we've increased our market share of U.S. exports significantly. And that's something the President is also proud of.\nQ: But the idea of actually taking action by government against the moving of a plant or a business abroad at the loss of American jobs -- is that an area in which the President would have a difference from the President-elect on economic policy?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So, again, the President believes, generally speaking, that when manufacturing jobs stay in the United States, that's a good thing. That's welcome news. So I'm not here to criticize Carrier's announcement from earlier this week. If 1,000 jobs are staying in Indiana, that's welcome news not only to the people of Indiana but to the greater community there.\nLook, if you look at holistically what the next President's policies will be, you can judge them by our policies. And if you look at our record in a state like Indiana, Indiana in 2009 had an unemployment rate of 10.9 percent. It's now dropped to 4.4 percent. So, again, if you look at -- I'm not going to be in a position to judge President Trump's economic record until he's had some time in office. Maybe then you guys will invite us back for a briefing. But I think Josh laid out a few days ago -- (laughter) --\nQ: Is that something we do? (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh laid out a few days ago some metrics by which you can use. These are metrics that we are enormously proud of, that we think speak to the President's record and leadership, but also to the grit and determination of the American worker.\nQ: My other question was about the Democratic National Chairmanship. There appears to be some growing opposition to Congressman Ellison. On the other hand, he has significant support -- notably that of Senator Sanders. Is the administration -- anyone from the President on down -- taking a part in the selection of the next Democratic National Chairman?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So I know this is a process that's going to work itself out sort of organically, conventionally. Sometimes that's a little messy and it spills over into the public space. But there's a handful of candidates for the chairmanship, some of whom are publically working it and have declared, some of whom are still evaluating whether they want to get in this race.\nSo we're not going to -- I'm not going to have an endorsement for you today from here, but the President has spoken generally about how the Democratic Party can rebuild itself, that obviously the results of the election in November were not elections that we either anticipated or desired. And the President has spoken about how this Democratic Party is going to need to make some changes in order to make sure that we're better at getting our message across; that we're better at showing up in communities that might not initially be receptive to our argument and our case, but that's all the more reason to be present and to show up and make our case.\nSo I think that's going to be a debate and a conversation that the Democratic Party has. Obviously there's certain stakeholders and constituency groups and leadership profiles and members of Congress that will be consulted as the Democratic Committee selects its new chair, but we don't have a preference to weigh in from here today.\nQ: And know if the President's official family has a preference either?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Not that I know of.\nJohn.\nQ: I wanted to ask a few questions about the forum which took place yesterday up at Harvard, which you could say you're familiar with. This forum takes place every four years, and it involves high-ranking campaign aides from both the winning campaign and the losing campaign. And with these forums, they're generally very civil. Yesterday was anything but civil. Are you surprised by the tone of the forum which took place yesterday up in Massachusetts?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I guess I'm not too surprised, given how hard-fought this campaign was, that there would still be a lot of passion and a lot of emotion that both sides are wrestling with. This wasn't a typical campaign, as I think most people in this room have observed, so I'm not surprised that there would be a feisty program up at Harvard. As you point out, they do this every four years. It's an opportunity to sort of dissect and debrief how the campaign went. So I'm not surprised that it was particularly feisty.\nI don't -- I'm also not sure that that's a bad thing. I think it's okay to be candid and to honestly look back at the decisions you made, the decisions your opponent made, and how that played out in the context of the race when you're not in the heat of it. So often in a campaign, you're making a decision in the heat of the moment and don't really have time to sort of think a few days back or a few days forward. And so it's nice to be able to just sort of take a breath and really digest those decisions outside of the heat of the campaign.\nQ: The President has said, you have said, Josh has said that the President does not take back any of the harsh rhetoric that he aimed at President-elect Donald Trump out on the campaign trail, including calling him unfit to serve as commander-in-chief. But I'm wondering, given that the President has not felt the need to take back those remarks publicly, do you think it sends a cue to certain people who may still be bitter about the presidential election to essentially demonstrate in the manner that it demonstrated yesterday that lack of civility?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, John, I think that the President did speak out on the trail early and often about his profound differences with Mr. Trump. They didn't agree on most policies, on the rhetoric that he was using, and when Mr. Trump used campaign rhetoric that President Obama felt was contrary to our values he did speak out about it.\nSo you all covered that. He crisscrossed this country discussing that and highlighting it. But Mr. Trump won. He won the election on November 8th. So the President has made clear that our priority in light of that election is to provide for a seamless transition of power. That's what we're all working on here at the White House. That's been the directive sent across the federal bureaucracy to every agency to make sure that the President-elect's team, when they assume office, that they're ready to go on day one. And so that's been our focus.\nChris.\nQ: Eric, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, on Wednesday, heard arguments on whether sexual orientation discrimination constitutes gender discrimination under current civil rights law. Is the President aware of the proceedings? And is it fair to say he agrees discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual people violates Title 7?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Chris, I have not spoken to the President about this case, so I'm not sure how closely he is tracking. Generally speaking -- since it's clearly in litigation, there's only so much I can say -- but generally speaking, the President believes that equality is a fundamental right. It's not only a strong tradition and custom in the United States, it's enshrined in our Constitution. So he believes there's no place, both in government or outside, for discrimination. And that's a principle that he's fought for and that's animated his entire career in public service.\nQ: That generally is the principle, but the administration over the course of eight years hasn't articulated whether that existing law under Title 7 prohibits discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual people. Why haven't you specifically articulated that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, if we have something to add to this case that would come out of the Department of Justice. So you should check in with them to see if they've offered anything. I don't have any new announcements or positions from here.\nQ: Does the President welcome an announcement from the Justice Department that this kind of discrimination is legal under current law?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, typically, those decisions are made at the Department of Justice by career prosecutors and career litigants. So we're going to let them make those decisions. But if they have anything they should be able to get it to you, and if there's additional comment from here we'll make sure we reach out.\nJean.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. On North Korea sanctions, today the Treasury Department announced the addition of U.S. (inaudible) sanctions against North Korea. What specific items are available?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So I saw that announcement. We're not going to have much from here on the additional sanctions that President Park announced. I would draw your attention our focus has been the weeks of months of putting together work at the U.N. Security Council to draft and deliver and pass the strongest, most robust sanctions against North Korea on record.\nAs Josh discussed yesterday -- or two days ago now, I think -- that largely has to do with targeting coal experts out of North Korea. So we look forward to making sure those are implemented. And hopefully they deter some of the nefarious behavior and provocative acts we've seen out of North Korea.\nQ: That included WMD. It means military sanctions, or a little bit different -- what is the WMD?\nMR. SCHULTZ: This is the new South Korean sanctions, or the U.N.?\nQ: North Korea sanctions.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Right, but that was passed out of South Korea?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SCHULTZ: So I would refer you to President Park's team. I'm not as steeped in what South Korea had announced overnight.\nQ: So you don't have your own sanctions included -- WMD? (Inaudible.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: I see. Right. So in terms of our sanctions against North Korea, we can get you an update. I don't have anything new from here. Again, our focus has been working through Ambassador Power's office at the United Nations to make sure that the U.N. Security Council there passed the most robust and tough sanctions regime on record against North Korea.\nQ: You have a secondary sanctions --\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm happy to take a look.\nGoyal, we'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. As far as U.S.-India relations are concerned, Mr. Trump was speaking to the Indian-American community in New Jersey celebrating Diwali, where he said that -- we'll have great relations with India and also with Mr. Modi. And then also his daughter-in-law was at the Hindu Temple in Virginia where she was praising the Indian-American community. My question is, how are the relations in the last eight years between the U.S. and India under President Obama, and the last two and a half years with Prime Minister Modi? And what will the future?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I don't know who can tell you about the future, but I think we'll leave it to historians to judge the contours of the relationship between the United States and India. Obviously the President is enormously proud of his record of working closely with Prime Minister Modi. They've worked together on a number of projects -- most recently, the Paris agreement, that a lot of the work that went into that, again, was a deal brokered between nearly 200 countries, but India was a vital part of that. And that could not have been done without Prime Minister Modi's leadership.\nSo I know that President Obama speaks to his counterparts as heads of state frequently. Prime Minister Modi is one that he enjoys speaking with. They touch base regularly. And so it's a good thing for the United States if that relationship continues in some strength.\nQ: And as far as illegal immigration is concerned in the U.S., millions of them were living for the last five, ten or even twenty years, and they made their home America for them. Before, they were living in fear, underpaid and under the table and so forth. But now they are fearing that they may be deported. So any message the President may have for them that their future may not be as dark as they're thinking under the new administration?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I've seen the new administration -- the incoming administration start to answer questions about how they want to address this. Our message is quite simple, which is there's a reason that the President worked so hard to pass comprehensive immigration reform. That was a bill that was complicated, that was hard, but it was done with bipartisan support in the United States Senate. Democrats and Republicans came together to tackle one of the most complex issues facing our country. And they did so earnestly and with our sleeves rolled up and tried to solve a problem.\nUnfortunately, the House of Representatives left without doing a thing. And that's a stain on the House of Representatives and their leadership there. Unfortunately, they could have taken up this bill that was thoughtful and smart. It didn't represent everything the President wanted. It didn't represent everything Republicans wanted. But it was the result of a compromise and a lot of hard work.\nSo our message would be that it's not too late, that Republicans and Democrats can still work together on this. And that would be in the best interest of the country.\nQ: Final, one question, on the press. As far as press relations are concerned, President-elect Trump was not happy the way the press covered his message, that he was saying that the press was biased --\nMR. SCHULTZ: I know what that feels like.\nQ: And now even he's repeated now yesterday, also. My question is that: How can we repair the relations with the press, which has been covering everybody, everywhere, day and night, and giving everything? So what message you think -- how will you consolidate or consult with the press in the future?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I think our message is that freedom of the press is not only a strong tradition in this country but it's, again, enshrined in our Constitution, and for good reason. It instills a sense of accountability. It encourages transparency on the behalf of the administration. We've worked hard to live up to those ideals. The next administration will have to make a whole host of decisions based on how -- based on the high standard of transparency that we've set.\nSo that will be decisions they have to make, but there is a high bar when you run for President that you subject to scrutiny and transparency. And that's not always comfortable. That's not always enjoyable. But that's part of the job. And at the end of the day -- and the President has spoken about this -- that all makes us do our jobs better, when we know that the bar is high and that our actions are going to be scrutinized not only by the American people, but by professional journalists who take the time to really look at what we're doing, look at the policies we've made, look at the decisions we've made, and figure out if they're really in the best interest of the American people. And that's what the President-elect's team will have to do.\nYes.\nQ: More than 700,000 DREAMers trusted in President Obama, in that candidate -- feel they can be deported. What President Obama can do about it? And what answer gave to the Democratic lawmakers asking for presidential pardon, and also to delete the NSEER, which is the National Security Entry/Exit Register? Can you give us an answer about it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. The executive actions that you're asking about were the result of the President taking action because Congress failed to. So those were the policies that the President announced in conjunction with Department of Homeland Security because he thought it was in the best interest of our country.\nAs you and I think Goyal pointed out, we have millions of Americans living in the shadows not paying taxes, not accountable in their communities. These are neighbors, these are teachers, these are friends and families, coworkers. And the President believes that that's contrary to our values as a country.\nSo that's why he worked so hard to champion comprehensive immigration reform. Again, Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate came together to work on this and to tackle it. They put in a lot of work. They came up with a bill that, again, the President didn't view as perfect, but he thought did the job and represented a spirit of compromise in the spirit of tackling one of the country's most gripping problems.\nSo that bill passed the Senate; unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives decided to not bring it up. But that's going to be the best way to address a lot of the problems you're talking about.\nQ: I understood that; I covered that. But my question is, what President can do now that they feel they are vulnerable after they were registered in DACA?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, you'll have to speak to the next administration about how they want to do this. I know that some of their representatives in interviews have been answering -- offering questions. I don't think they've made any decisions yet based on public reports. So you should check in with them about how they're going to -- if they want to reverse this executive action or leave it in place or change it.\nQ: Was there any response of President Obama to these lawmakers? Luis Gutierrez and 50 lawmakers were asking for the pardon.\nMR. SCHULTZ: This is a process that starts at the Department of Justice. We have a well-established process for this, so I don't have any new ones to announce for you at this time.\nThanks. I have a week ahead if we want to do that.\nOn Monday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House. On Tuesday, the President will travel to Tampa, hopefully with Olivier, where he will meet with active-duty servicemembers at MacDill Air Force Base, the home of the U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. While in Tampa, the President will deliver remarks on the counterterrorism campaign and meet with uniformed leadership from both commands.\nOn Wednesday, the President will be here at the White House attending meetings. On Thursday, the President and First Lady will attend the Congressional Ball at the White House, one of our favorites. On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nThank you.\nEND 2:19 P.M.

It is a great pleasure for me to be able to welcome the Secretary-General-designate Guterres to the Oval Office. He will be assuming a post that obviously has enormous influence and impact around the world. The good news is that he has an extraordinary reputation as someone who has led multilateral organizations at the highest level and has done so in ways that everybody recognizes he's extraordinarily effective.\nMost recently his work with the U.N. High Commission on Refugees has been applauded for its effectiveness, its efficiency, and his ability to really concretely help people who are in extraordinary need. And the fact that, I think, all of us were pleasantly surprised by how quickly a consensus was achieved around Mr. Guterres's designation signifies the respect in which he's held all around the world.\nFrom the perspective of the United States, the U.N. is a critical partner in almost everything that we do. It is a linchpin of the post-World War II order, and through Democratic and Republican administrations, our partnership with the United Nations has allowed us to help resolve conflicts, to provide development assistance where it's sorely needed, to tackle big transnational challenges like refugee flows or, more recently, like climate change. And at a time when those challenges are mounting and there's great uncertainty around the world, having an effective partner in the United Nations Secretary-General will be critically important.\nSo this meeting gives us an opportunity to share our ideas about where the Secretary-General-designate intends to take the U.N. and how the United States can work effectively with him.\nI've emphasized to the current Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, how important the United States considers the U.N. but also how important it is, we believe, to make sure that the U.N. operates efficiently, that money is well spent, that we're doing everything we can to initiate the kinds of effective management practices that Mr. Guterres is known for, so that when we all have to be pinching pennies and being concerned about the needs around the world outstripping our resources, that the work we do in the U.N. is effective, concrete; that it's not just a forum for talking, but it's also a forum for doing.\nAnd I have great confidence that our soon-to-be Secretary-General will be able to be an extraordinarily effective leader of that organization. And the United States looks forward to working with him.\nSo, congratulations and good luck.\nSecretary-General-designate Guterres. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. My visit also is to express my total commitment to work closely with the United States, with the present administration, also with the next administration.\nWe live in a dangerous world. We are all aware of that. We have seen a multiplication of conflicts. Old conflicts seem never to die. And it's true, the international community has lost a lot of its capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts. On the other hand, globalization that has been an extremely important driver of economic growth, the reduction of poverty in many parts of the world has also left people behind. And this has been the cause of unrest and instability in many parts of the world.\nAnd the human rights agenda that is so dear to us all, we also see many difficulties in relation to it, when national sovereignty sometimes tends to make it difficult for human rights to be effective and to be promoted.\nNow, in all these areas, I believe that the leadership of United States is absolutely crucial. And in all these areas, I believe that we need a U.N. that is more effective, more cost effective, more able to serve the people with a very strong reform-minded approach. And the U.S. has always been a driver for reforming the U.N., and I'm deeply committed to pursue that objective to make sure that the U.N. can be a positive partner in the efforts that the U.S. is leading—[inaudible].\nPresident Obama.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity's \"Report on Securing and Growing the Digital Economy,\" dated December 1, was released by the Office of the Press Secretary with this statement. The statement referred to President-elect Donald J. Trump.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119827", "text": "In February of this year, I directed the creation of a nonpartisan Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity, charging it with assessing the current state of cybersecurity in our country and recommending bold, actionable steps that the Government, private sector, and the Nation as a whole can take to bolster cybersecurity in today's digital world. Yesterday the members of the Commission—leaders from industry and academia, many with experience in government—provided their findings and recommendations to me. And earlier today I met with the Commission's Chair, Tom Donilon, to discuss how we as a country can build on the Commission's work and enhance our cybersecurity over the coming years. I want to thank the Commission members for their hard work and for their thoughtful and detailed recommendations. I am confident that if we implement the Commission's recommendations, our economy, critical infrastructure, and national security will be better equipped to thrive in the coming years.\nThe Commission's report makes clear that cybersecurity is one of the greatest challenges we face as a nation. That is why I have consistently made cybersecurity a top national security and economic security priority, reflected most recently by the Cybersecurity National Action Plan I announced in February and my 2017 budget, which called for a more than 35 percent increase in Federal cybersecurity resources.\nDuring my administration, we have executed a consistent strategy focused on three priorities:\n1. Raising the level of cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sectors;\n2. Deterring and disrupting malicious cyber activity aimed at the United States or its allies; and\n3. Effectively responding to and recovering from cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nTo strengthen our cybersecurity defenses across the country, in 2013 we convened experts from industry, academia, and civil society to create the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. As the Commission notes, the framework has become the gold standard for cybersecurity risk management, and I wholeheartedly support the Commission's recommendations to expand its usage in the Federal Government, the private sector, and abroad. We encouraged the formation of information sharing and analysis organizations, worked with Congress to enact tailored liability protections for private sector entities that share threat information with the Government, and took steps to automate information sharing. As the Commission calls for, we launched public campaigns to promote cybersecurity awareness among consumers, including the \"Lock Down Your Login\" campaign encouraging consumers to better secure their identities online. We have given consumers more tools to secure their financial future by assisting victims of identity theft, improved the Government's payment security, and accelerated the transition to next-generation payment security. We have invested in cybersecurity research and development to lay the groundwork for stronger cyber defenses in the future. And I have clarified the roles and responsibilities of Federal agencies in responding to significant cyber incidents by issuing a new directive codifying 8 years of lessons learned from incident response.\nTo strengthen Government cybersecurity, we created the first-ever Federal Chief Information Security Officer and drove dramatic improvements in Federal agencies' use of strong authentication and in critical vulnerability patching. We have pushed to reduce the Federal Government's reliance on legacy technologies, proposing an innovative $3.1 billion fund to modernize costly and vulnerable information technology (IT) systems, a fund that the Commission proposes to expand. We updated the guidance for Federal agency IT management, cybersecurity, and privacy, introducing the kind of coordination that the Commission calls for. Agencies are increasingly centralizing their cybersecurity efforts and relying on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for shared services like vulnerability detection, network discovery and monitoring, intrusion detection and prevention, and cybersecurity assessments of high-priority IT systems. Consolidating DHS' cybersecurity and infrastructure protection missions within a single DHS line agency—as my administration has proposed, and as the Commission recommends—would further strengthen DHS' ability to support Federal and critical infrastructure cybersecurity. Finally, consistent with the Commission's emphasis on improving the Nation's cybersecurity workforce, my administration has issued a comprehensive workforce strategy and has hired more than 6,000 new cybersecurity professionals in the Federal Government in 2016 alone.\nAs the Commission recognizes, we have championed the application of international law to cyberspace; promoted voluntary international norms of state behavior during peacetime, securing over 30 countries' commitment to these norms in the G-20 and other international fora; and committed to confidence-building measures to reduce escalation risk. We have secured commitments from China and other nations to oppose cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property and business secrets for commercial gain, sought to modernize the Mutual Legal Assistance process, and submitted legislation to enable greater cross-border data sharing between law enforcement agencies, another effort the Commission strongly supports. We have developed additional tools and cyber capabilities to deter and disrupt malicious cyber activity aimed at the United States. Finally, we created the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center to ensure that there is a single Governmentwide source for integrated intelligence assessments on cyber threats.\nIn total, the Commission's recommendations affirm the course that this administration has laid out, but make clear that there is much more to do and the next administration, Congress, the private sector, and the general public need to build on this progress. Deepening public-private cooperation will help us better protect critical infrastructure and respond to cyber incidents when they occur. Expanding the use of strong authentication to improve identity management will make all of us more secure online. Increasing investments in research and development will improve the security of products and technologies. Investing in human capital, education, and the productivity of the cybersecurity workforce will ensure that this country's best and brightest are helping us stay ahead of the cybersecurity curve. Continuing to prioritize and coordinate cybersecurity efforts across the Federal Government will ensure that this critical challenge remains a top national security priority. And furthering the promotion of international norms of responsible state behavior will ensure that the global community is able to confront the ever-evolving threats we face.\nThe Commission's recommendations are thoughtful and pragmatic. Accordingly, my administration strongly supports the Commission's work, and we will take additional action wherever possible to build on the work my administration has already undertaken and to make progress on its new recommendations before the end of my term. Importantly though, I believe that the next administration and the next Congress can benefit from the Commission's insights and should use the Commission's recommendations as a guide. I have asked the Commission to brief the President-elect's transition team at their earliest opportunity. Further, we must provide sufficient resources to meet the critical cybersecurity challenges called out in the Commission's report. Before Congress adjourns for the year, it must act to fully fund the urgent cybersecurity needs that my administration has identified in my 2017 budget and elsewhere, investing in areas such as securing Federal information technology systems, protecting critical infrastructure, and investing in our cybersecurity workforce.\nAs the Commission's report counsels, we have the opportunity to change the balance further in our favor in cyberspace, but only if we take additional bold action to do so. My administration has made considerable progress in this regard over the last 8 years. Now it is time for the next administration to take up this charge and ensure that cyberspace can continue to be the driver for prosperity, innovation, and change, both in the United States and around the world.", "timestamp": "2016-12-02", "title": "Statement on the Report of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity"}

This progress has made America a leader in advancing the rights of people with disabilities around the globe. On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we celebrate how far we have come in protecting the rights of those who live with disabilities and recommit to shaping a future in which all members of this community can enjoy their full rights and freedoms.\nBuilding on the progress of the ADA, my Administration has taken important steps to remove barriers and eliminate discrimination based on disability. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, individuals can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition or disability. We have supported increasing funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, and strengthened anti-discrimination and Olmstead enforcement at the Department of Justice. Additionally, we created the first-ever Special Advisor for International Disability Rights, and we established the United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally in order to address violence against women and girls around the world—because women with a disability are more likely to experience physical and sexual abuse than women without one. And last year, we committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which recognize inclusive education, disability employment, and social acceptance of the disability community as important steps to ending world poverty.\nOur progress at home reflects our full commitment to the rights of people with disabilities around the world. America was the first country to comprehensively address non-discrimination on the basis of disability in national legislation and declare that disability rights are human rights which must be recognized and promoted everywhere. In my first year in office, the United States joined 140 other nations in signing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities—the first international human rights convention to fully address human rights in the context of disability. Now joined by over 160 States Parties, this Convention serves as a beacon of hope to the more than 1 billion people worldwide who live with a disability—a reminder that the need to protect disability rights does not end at our borders. Regrettably, the Senate has still not provided its advice and consent for ratification of this Convention, and I urge them to do so and to uphold our global commitment to the international disability community.\nWe have taken important steps forward to advance the rights of persons with disabilities, but the fight is not over. As long as anyone succumbs to casual discrimination or fear of the unfamiliar, we have more work to do to honor the many people with disabilities who have shared their stories of exclusion and injustice—and the millions more they spoke up for. Because of the advocates who have led the way, more individuals with disabilities can pursue their full measure of happiness. They have taught us that our world is far better off when all people can live up to their full potential—it makes all of us more whole, and it makes our world a better place.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2016, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-02", "title": "Proclamation 9550—International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2016"}

On the first day of my administration, I promised to restore science to its rightful place. I told you we would unleash American innovation and technology to tackle the health challenges of our time. Over the last 8 years, we've delivered on that promise in many ways, both big and small, including, of course, providing health coverage to 20 million more Americans and making health care more affordable for all Americans.\nRight now we have the chance to put our best minds to work one more time and in a big way. There's a bill in Congress that could help unlock a cure for Alzheimer's, end cancer as we know it, and help people seeking treatment for opioid addiction finally get the help they need. It's called the 21st Century Cures Act. It's an opportunity to save lives and an opportunity we just can't miss.\nThis bill would do a lot of good things at once. Let me tell you about five of them.\nFirst, it will make real investments this year to combat the heroin and prescription drug epidemic that's plaguing so many of our communities. Drug overdoses now take more lives every year than traffic accidents, and deaths from opioid overdoses have nearly quadrupled since 1999. Under Obamacare, health plans in the marketplace have to include coverage for treatment, but there's more we need to do. For nearly a year, I've been calling for this investment so hundreds of thousands of Americans can get the treatment they need, and I'm glad Congress is finally getting it done.\nThe second thing the Cures Act does is make a significant investment in Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot. In my State of the Union Address this year, I set a goal of making America the country that ends cancer once and for all, and I put the Vice President in charge of \"mission control.\" This bill will allow us to invest in promising new therapies, in new ways to detect and prevent cancer, and to develop more vaccines for cancer just as we have them for measles or mumps. Joe's done an incredible job; this bill is a chance for Congress to do its part too.\nThird, we'll be giving researchers the resources they need to help identify ways to treat, cure, and prevent all kinds of brain disorders: Alzheimer's, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury. And it also supports the Precision Medicine Initiative, an effort we started to bring doctors and data together to develop treatments and health care that one day can be tailored specifically for you. That can lead to some big breakthroughs.\nFourth, the Cures Act includes bipartisan mental health reforms, including important programs for suicide prevention.\nAnd fifth, we're making sure the FDA incorporates patient voices—your voices—into the decisions they make as they develop drugs.\nSo that's what the 21st Century Cures Act is all about. Like all good legislation, it reflects compromise. This week, the House passed it overwhelmingly and in bipartisan fashion. The Senate will vote in the next few days, and I hope they'll do the same. I'll sign it as soon as it reaches my desk, because like a lot of you, I've lost people that I love deeply to cancer. I hear every day from Americans whose loved ones are suffering from addiction and other debilitating diseases. And I believe we should seize every chance we have to find cures as soon as possible. When it's your family, hope can't come soon enough.\nThanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-12-03", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Well, good evening, everybody.\nAudience members. Good evening!\nThe President. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. Over the past 8 years, this has always been one of our favorite nights. And this year, I was especially looking forward to seeing how Joe Walsh cleans up. [Laughter] Pretty good. [Laughter]\nI want to begin by once again thanking everybody who makes this wonderful evening possible, including David Rubenstein, the Kennedy Center Trustees—I'm getting a big echo back there—and the Kennedy Center President, Deborah Rutter. Give them a big round of applause.\nWe have some outstanding Members of Congress here tonight. And we are honored also to have Vicki Kennedy and three of President Kennedy's grandchildren with us here: Rose, Tatiana, and Jack. [Applause] Hey!\nSo the arts have always been part of life at the White House because the arts are always central to American life. And that's why, over the past 8 years, Michelle and I have invited some of the best writers and musicians, actors, dancers to share their gifts with the American people, and to help tell the story of who we are, and to inspire what's best in all of us. Along the way, we've enjoyed some unbelievable performances. This is one of the perks of the job that I will miss. [Laughter]\nThanks to Michelle's efforts, we've brought the arts to more young people, from hosting workshops where they learn firsthand from accomplished artists, to bringing \"Hamilton\" to students who wouldn't normally get a ticket to Broadway. And on behalf of all of us, I want to say thanks to my wife for having done such a tremendous job. [Applause] Yay! And she's always looked really good doing it. [Laughter] She does. [Laughter]\nThis is part of how we've tried to honor the legacy of President and Mrs. Kennedy. They understood just how vital art is to our democracy: that we need song and cinema and paintings and performance to help us challenge our assumptions, to question the way things are, and maybe inspire us to think about how things might be. The arts help us celebrate our triumphs, but also holds up a mirror to our flaws. And all of that deepens our understanding of the human condition. It helps us to see ourselves in each other. It helps to bind us together as a people.\nAs President Kennedy once said, \"In serving his vision of the truth, the artist best serves his nation.\" Tonight we honor five amazing artists who have dedicated their lives to telling their truth and helping us to see our own.\nAt 8 years old, Mavis Staples climbed onto a chair in church, leaned into the microphone, raised her eyes upwards, and belted out the gospel. When people heard that deep, old soul coming out of that little girl, they wept, which, understandably, concerned her. [Laughter] But her mother told her: \"Mavis, they're happy. Your singing makes them cry happy tears.\" It was those early appearances on the South Side of Chicago—South Side!—[laughter]—with Mavis, her siblings, their father, Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples, that launched the legendary Staple Singers. Theirs was gospel with just a touch of country, a twist of the blues, little bit of funk. There was a little bit of sin with the salvation. [Laughter] And driven by Pops's reverbed guitar, Mavis's powerhouse vocals, and the harmonies that only family can make, the Staple Singers broke new ground with songs like \"Uncloudy Day.\" They had some truth to tell. Inspired by Dr. King, Pops would tell his kids, \"If he can preach it, we can sing it.\" And so they wrote anthems like \"Freedom Highway\" and \"When Will We Be Paid,\" which became the soundtrack of the civil rights movement.\nAs a solo artist, Mavis has done it all and worked with just about everybody, from Bob Dylan to Prince to Jeff Tweedy. On albums like \"We'll Never Turn Back\" and \"One True Vine,\" she still is singing for justice and equality and influencing a new generation of musicians and fans. And each soulful note, even in heartbreak and even in despair, is grounded in faith and in hope and the belief that there are better days yet to come. \"These aren't just songs I'm singing to be moving my lips,\" she says. \"I mean this.\" And we mean it too. Six decades on, nobody makes us feel \"The Weight\" like Mavis Staples. Give her a big round of applause.\nAl Pacino calls the theater his \"flashlight.\" [Laughter] It's how he finds himself, where he sees truth. And since Al first hit Broadway in 1969, his singular talent has been the gold standard for acting. A great playwright once compared the way Al inhabits his characters to the way Louis Armstrong played jazz. One director said that while \"some actors play characters, Al Pacino becomes them.\" And we've all seen it. In the span of 5 years—you think about it—he became Serpico, became Sonny Wortzik, twice became Michael Corleone for, let's face it, what's got to be the two best movies of all time—[laughter]—became Tony Montana on screen, then became the owner of a couple of Tonys on the stage. [Laughter] And he's always been this way.\nAt 13, Al committed so profoundly to a role in the school play that when his character was supposed to get sick on stage, Al actually got sick on stage. [Laughter] I'm not sure how audiences felt about that. [Laughter] But later, when he played Richard III and Jackie Kennedy visited him backstage, the actor playing this self-absorbed king didn't even stand up to greet actual American royalty, which he says he still regrets. [Laughter]\nThrough it all, Al has always cared more for his flashlight than the spotlight. He says he's still getting used to the idea of being an icon. But his gift, for all the inspiration and intensity that he brings to his roles, is that he lets us into what his characters are feeling. And for that, we are extraordinarily grateful. Al Pacino.\nIn the late sixties, James Taylor got the chance to audition in front of Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Now, Ringo, I don't know if you were there, but this is a true story. [Laughter] \"I was as nervous as a Chihuahua on methamphetamines\"—[laughter]—is what James Taylor says. Which is exactly the kind of metaphor that makes him such a brilliant songwriter. [Laughter]\nBut if James has a defining gift, it is empathy. It's why he's been such a great friend to Michelle and myself. We're so grateful to him and Kim for their friendship over the years. It's why everybody from Carole King to Garth Brooks to Taylor Swift collaborates with him. It's what makes him among the most prolific and admired musicians of our time. In fact, James recently went through all his songs and kept coming across the same stories: songs about fathers and traffic jams, love songs, recovery songs. I really love this phrase: \"hymns for agnostics.\" [Laughter] He says that in making music: \"There's the idea of comforting yourself. There's also the idea of taking something that's untenable and internal and communicating it.\" And that's why it feels like James is singing only to you when he sings. It feels like he's singing about your life. The stories he tells and retells dwell on our most enduring and shared experiences. \"Carolina on My Mind\" is about where you grew up, even if you didn't grow up in Carolina. \"Mean Old Man\" is probably somebody you know. \"Angels of Fenway\"—well, actually, that's just about the Red Sox. So—[laughter]—if you're a White Sox fan, you don't love that song, but it's okay.\nJames is the consummate truthteller about a life that can leave us with more unresolved questions than satisfying answers, but holds so much beauty that you don't mind. And from his honesty about his own struggles with substance abuse to his decades of progressive activism, James Taylor has inspired people all over the world and helped America live up to our highest ideals. Thank you, James Taylor.\nWithout a preschool rivalry, we might not be honoring Martha Argerich. [Laughter] The story goes that when Martha was 2 years old, a little boy taunted her, saying, \"I'll bet you can't play the piano!\" [Laughter] So she sat down at the keys, remembered a piece her teacher had played, and played it flawlessly. By 8 years old, she had made her concert debut. By the time she was a teenager, she left her native Argentina to study in Vienna and won two major international competitions, launching one of the most storied and influential careers in classical music. That little boy lost his bet. [Laughter]\nMartha combines unparalleled technical prowess with passion and glittering musicianship. From Bach to Schumann, she doesn't just play the piano, she possesses it. Martha can charge through a passage with astonishing power and speed and accuracy and, in the same performance, uncover the delicate beauty in each note. As a critic once wrote, \"She is an unaffected interpreter whose native language is music.\"\nBut what truly sets her apart and has cemented her place as one of the greatest pianists in modern history is her dogged commitment to her craft. In an age of often superficial connections, where people too often seek fame and recognition, Martha has been guided by one passion, and that is fidelity to the music. She can only be herself. And that is the truest mark of an artist. And the result is timeless, transcendent music for which we thank Martha Argerich.\nAnd finally, there have been some interesting said—things said about this next group, including being called \"one of rock's most contentiously dysfunctional families.\" [Laughter] So yes, it was unlikely that they'd ever get back together and that they'd call their reunion tour \"Hell Freezes Over.\" [Laughter] I love that. But here's the thing: When you listen to the Eagles, you hear the exact opposite story, and that is perfect harmony.\nYou hear it in the crisp, overpowering a capella chords of \"Seven Bridges Road,\" dueling guitar solos in \"Hotel California,\" complex, funky riffs opening \"Life in the Fast Lane.\" It's the sound not just of a California band, but one of America's signature bands, a supergroup whose greatest hits sold more copies in the United States than any other record in the 20th century. And the 20th century had some pretty good music. [Laughter]\nSo, here tonight, we have three of the Eagles: Don Henley, the meticulous, introspective songwriter with an unmistakable voice that soars above his drum set; Timothy Schmit, the bass player and topline of many of those harmonies; and Joe Walsh, who's as rowdy with a guitar lick as I'm told he once was in a hotel room. [Laughter] Twice. [Laughter] This is the White House though. [Laughter] And Michelle and I are about to leave. As I've said before, we want to get our security deposit back. So—[laughter].\nBut of course, the Eagles are also the one and only Glenn Frey. And we all wish Glenn was still here with us. We are deeply honored to be joined by his beautiful wife Cindy and their gorgeous children. Because the truth is that these awards aren't just about this reception or even the show we have this evening, which will be spectacular. The Kennedy Center Honors are about folks who spent their lives calling on us to think a little harder and feel a little deeper and express ourselves a little more bravely and maybe \"take it easy\" once in a while. And that is Glenn Frey, the driving force behind a band that owned a decade and did not stop there. We are all familiar with his legacy. And the music of the Eagles will always be woven into the fabric of our Nation.\nSo we are extraordinarily honored to be able to give thanks for the Eagles. And what's true for them is true for all of tonight's honorees: remarkable individuals who have created the soundtrack to our own lives: on road trips, in jukebox diners; folks who have mesmerized us on a Saturday night out at the movies or at a concert hall.\nMavis Staples, Al Pacino, James Taylor, Martha Argerich, The Eagles: Their legacies are measured not just in terms of works of art, but the lives they've touched, and creating a stronger and more beautiful America. They're artists who have served our Nation by serving their truth. And we're all better off for it.\nSo before we transport ourselves to what I'm sure will be a spectacular evening, please join me in saluting our extraordinary 2016 Kennedy Center Honorees.", "timestamp": "2016-12-04", "title": "Remarks at the Kennedy Center Honors Reception"}

While his mother lacked access to a quality education, she encouraged her sons in their scholastic pursuits and instilled the value of hard work. Carson graduated with honors from Southwestern High School, where he also became a senior commander in the school's ROTC program. He earned a full scholarship to Yale University and graduated in 1973 with a B.A. degree in psychology.\nCarson then enrolled in the School of Medicine at the University of Michigan, choosing to become a neurosurgeon. Dr. Carson became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital at age 33 and earned fame for his groundbreaking work separating conjoined twins.\nTwenty years ago, Carson and his wife Candy started the Carson Scholars Fund, which is now active in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It has provided more than 7,300 scholarships since 1994 to students from all backgrounds that achieve at the highest academic levels and community service. It also encompasses the Reading Room program and reading rooms have been placed throughout the country to stimulate a love for reading, especially in those who are underserved.\nIn 2000, the Library of Congress selected Dr. Carson as one of its \"Living Legends.\" The following year, CNN and Time magazine named Dr. Carson as one of the nation's 20 foremost physicians and scientists. In 2006, he received the Spingarn Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the NAACP. In February 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Dr. Carson the Ford's Theatre Lincoln Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.", "timestamp": "2016-12-05", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119761", "text": "(WASHINGTON) - Influential leaders are speaking out in support of Dr. Ben Carson upon the announcement that President-elect Donald J. Trump will appoint him Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of the United States.\nDr. Carson is a distinguished national leader who overcame his troubled youth in the inner city of Detroit to become a renowned neurosurgeon famous for successfully separating conjoined twins. Dr. Carson is an outsider bringing a fresh perspective to an agency riddled with overgrown bureaucratic largess.\nStatements of support from elected officials and leaders from the housing community came pouring in Monday, pointing the way to a smooth confirmation process. Here's what they're saying...\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell:\n\"We appreciate Dr. Carson's willingness to take on such a challenging task at an agency that is in need of reform to better serve all Americans. I'm confident his life-long career of selfless service will be a positive addition to the incoming administration.\"\nScott Olson, Executive Director, Community Home Lenders Association:\n\"CHLA congratulates Dr. Ben Carson on his nomination to be HUD Secretary. We urge him to focus on continuing the strong progress in FHA's financial health, and on ending the overcharging of FHA premiums, by taking prompt steps to cut annual premiums and end the Life of Loan premium policy instituted three years ago.\"\nWilliam Brown, President, National Association of Realtors:\n\"We congratulate Dr. Carson on accepting this important challenge and wish him the very best of luck in meeting the task ahead. While we've made great strides in recent years, far more can be done to put the dream of homeownership in reach for more Americans.\"\nDavid Stevens, President and CEO, Mortgage Bankers Association:\n\"On behalf of the MBA I want to congratulate Dr. Ben Carson on being chosen to be nominated as the Secretary of HUD. Housing is one of the largest contributors to the health and success of the overall economy, and as such we must continue to recognize its significance.\n\"MBA looks forward to working with Dr. Carson in helping to build out a well-rounded team of housing experts, with a deep technical understanding of the issues, at HUD, FHA and Ginnie Mae. MBA wishes Dr. Carson and the rest of the administration success as they get ready to embark upon these next four years.\"\nEd Brady, Chairman, National Association of Home Builders:\n\"NAHB congratulates Dr. Carson on his nomination as HUD secretary. He is a thoughtful leader who is sure to assemble a professional team of policy experts and be a great spokesperson for housing. Upon his confirmation to the Cabinet post, NAHB looks forward to working with Dr. Carson to promote pro-housing policies that support homeownership, provide rental housing opportunities for low- and middle-income households, and remove regulatory barriers that are needlessly raising housing costs for hard-working American families.\"\nThe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and National Apartment Association (NAA):\n\"NMHC and NAA congratulate Dr. Carson on his selection as HUD Secretary. As the voice of an industry that contributes $1.3 trillion annually to the economy, represents more than 12 million jobs and the 39 million who live in apartment homes, NMHC and NAA are looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump and his nominee for Secretary of HUD.\"\nChris Estes, President and CEO, National Housing Conference:\n\"Having access to an affordable home is the foundation for good health, educational success and opportunity for all Americans, and Dr. Carson has the ability to make a significant positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans through a strong commitment to the vital work of this agency.\n\"We look forward to learning more about President-elect Trump's and Dr. Carson's vision for housing and community development policy and to working with the agency to help meet the housing needs of all in America.\"\nFormer Representative Rick Lazio (R-NY):\n\"Dr. Ben Carson has an inspirational life story. He transcended the challenges that confronted him growing up in poverty in Detroit, became one of the most gifted pediatric neurosurgeons in the world, and, in the process, became a national role model. He can now take his experiences, intellect, and leadership qualities to focus attention on the silent and growing housing crisis that is facing America.\n\"I had a lengthy and detailed discussion with Dr. Carson over the past few days, and I am impressed by his passion for housing issues and his determination to meet the many growing challenges facing HUD.\n\"As someone who has spent years fighting for more and better affordable housing, I'm excited by the prospect of Dr. Carson mobilizing support to confront this silent crisis.\n\"During our discussion, I was impressed by Dr. Carson's exceptional intellect and commitment to find solutions that break the back of entrenched poverty in America. Under Dr. Carson, HUD is positioned to provide critical leadership in meeting president-elect Trump's goal of revitalizing America's communities. He is an innovative thinker and an articulate and effective spokesperson. Under his leadership, HUD can be a part of the solution to the housing challenges of our nation.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-05", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: President-elect Donald J.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119842", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n12:28 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. I hope you all enjoyed your weekends. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKevin, would you like to begin?\nQ: Sure. Thank you, Josh. Has the President talked to anyone affiliated with President-elect Trump's transition team or to President Xi about the President-elect's call with the leader in Taiwan? Have any concerns been expressed with foreign leaders at all about this call? Or is this simply President-elect Trump's to own and for the current administration to distance itself from?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I don't have any presidential conversations to tell you about. I can confirm that U.S. officials, including senior officials at the National Security Council, have been in touch with their Chinese counterparts to reiterate our country's continued commitment to a one-China policy.\nThis is a policy that is based on three joint U.S.-China communiques that were negotiated by different U.S. Presidents in different parties and, of course, by the Taiwan Relations Act. This is a policy that has been in place for nearly 40 years, and it has been focused on promoting and preserving peace and stability in the strait. The adherence to and commitment to this policy has advanced the ability of the United States to make progress in our relationship with China and, of course, has benefitted the people of Taiwan. Taiwan, after all, is the ninth-largest trading partner of the United States, and they certainly benefit from peace and stability in the strait. And pursuit of and commitment to that peace and stability advances U.S. interests.\nIf the President-elect's team has a different aim, I'll leave it to them to describe.\nQ: Have you had conversations with the President-elect's team, and did you get the sense that this call is designed to forge closer relations with Taiwan?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's hard to determine exactly what the aim was of the President-elect. I know both the Vice President-elect and his campaign manager were -- when asked about this over the weekend, indicated that these were courtesy calls -- or that this was a courtesy call and the President-elect was merely returning that call. The Washington Post today tells a different story, with some Trump aides indicating that this was a long-planned call and that this is part of a broader strategic effort.\nIt's unclear exactly what the strategic effort is, what the aim of the strategic effort is, and it's unclear exactly what potential benefit could be experienced by the United States, China or Taiwan. But I'll leave that to them to explain.\nQ: Keeping on foreign affairs, what is the President's reaction to the election results in Italy? And he put some political capital into this, bringing Prime Minister Renzi in for the final official visit. Is he disappointed in the results? And is he concerned that this is kind of the beginning of the unraveling of the European Union?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, obviously both the President and the President-elect had quite a bit to say about this when Prime Minister Renzi was here at the White House back in October. And the President, at that point, indicated his hope that the Italian people would be supportive of the referendum and the reforms that Prime Minister Renzi put forward. Didn't turn out that way.\nI would warn against painting with an overly broad brush about the potential consequences of this outcome. There certainly is a not entirely unreasonable tendency to want to loop together the outcome in the UK and even the outcome of the U.S. presidential election with this outcome. But each of these is different. We're talking about different constituencies. In one case, we're talking about a presidential election; in two other cases we're talking about a referendum, only one of which actually had a direct impact on Brexit.\nSo there are some broader trends that are worthy of analysis, but I think there's a risk in oversimplifying that analysis based on the outcome of yesterday's referendum in Italy.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Roberta.\nQ: Since Friday, what contact has the administration had with other allies in Asia who may have been concerned about the call?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any other diplomatic conversations to tell you about. Obviously the United States, through the State Department and other agencies, including occasionally from the National Security Council, is in touch with our allies not just in Asia but around the world. I think that there were a couple of conversations over the weekend between senior U.S. officials at the National Security Council and Chinese officials to reiterate and clarify the continued commitment of the United States the our longstanding one-China policy. But beyond that, I don't have diplomatic conversations to read you out.\nQ: You can't say one way or the other whether there were other conversations with other allies?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't say one way or the other.\nQ: And I guess I'm wondering, with the rebels in Aleppo being almost completely overwhelmed, how concerned is the White House that Al-Nusra or other groups like that are going to step in and sort of gain strength because of what's happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think our concern with the situation in Aleppo right now, Roberta, is focused on the plight of thousands of civilians, including children, who are caught in harm's way. And the reports continue to trickle out of Aleppo are increasingly dire and the situation there continues to worsen. And it's clear that while far too many innocent lives have already been lost, there are many more innocent lives that are at risk, including women and children.\nAnd it is a reflection of the depravity of the Assad regime. It is a reflection of the willingness of the Russian government and the Iranians to risk deepening involvement in a quagmire to accomplish a goal of trying to shore up their influence in the region. And it raises profound moral concerns. It also serves to isolate Syria, Russia and Iran from basically the rest of the world, who's deeply concerned with the violence that they see continuing to be perpetuated in that war-torn country.\nQ: So it raises profound moral concerns. Are any adjustments being made to U.S. policy in Syria because of what's happening now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the U.S. efforts underway right now are diplomatic in nature. And we have said from the beginning of this conflict that a military solution is not available. The only available solution is a diplomatic one. And for a time, the United States, through the historic and tenacious efforts of Secretary of State Kerry, were focused on trying to reach a bilateral negotiated agreement with the Russians. But again, despite his tenacious efforts, that kind of solution was not to be found. But Secretary of State Kerry has remained undeterred and has continued to pursue a multilateral negotiated agreement to try to bring the violence to an end, or at least reduce the violence and not allow so many innocent Syrians to be in harm's way of a bloody bombing campaign.\nBut I'd refer you to the State Department of an update on those efforts, but obviously that's something that he continues to work on very diligently because of our nation's profound concern for the plight of those innocent Syrian men, women and children.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Among the criticism that's been out there of Donald Trump's foreign policy or his contact with foreign leaders are that he's winging it, and also we've heard from one who is a congressman, that that's how wars start. How seriously does the administration take some of these contacts? I mean, do you think that this borders on dangerous?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, whenever you are talking about the President-elect of the United States interacting with foreign leaders, it's incredibly important. It has profound consequences for our country and for our national interests around the world. In talking about this situation -- well, let me be more specific.\nLast week, we had some conversations about a conversation that the President-elect had with the Prime Minister of Pakistan. And I noted in answering questions about that telephone call that President Obama, over the course of his eight years in the White House, has benefitted significantly from the expertise, advice, and experience of career diplomats at the State Department. And that expertise and advice is available to the President-elect. That advice will continue to be available to him when he enters the Oval Office. President Obama benefitted from it, and President-elect would, as well.\nQ: Do you think that his contact with Taiwan and his tweeting about China, is that dangerous?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is that there has been a longstanding policy in place that's been governed by our one-China policy, undergirded by three different joint communiquйs negotiated between U.S. Presidents and their Chinese counterparts. My understanding is that these -- or the facts are that these communiquйs were negotiated, one in 1972 by President Nixon, one in 1979 by President Carter, and one in 1982 by President Reagan, and those joint communiquйs have guided our approach to this region of the world. And the Chinese government in Beijing places an enormous priority on this situation and it's a sensitive matter. And some of the progress that we have made in our relationship with China could be undermined by this issue flaring up. It's also unclear how the people who live in Taiwan benefit from this issue flaring up.\nThe response from the Chinese government in the aftermath of this call has primarily been to ratchet up the rhetoric against Taiwan. And it's unclear to me how that kind of consequence benefits the people of Taiwan or benefits the ninth-largest trading partner of the United States. So these are significant issues and worthy of careful consideration.\nQ: And we know the Chinese officials reached out to the current administration after this phone call with Taiwan. So what does this administration say to the Chinese in this instance? I mean, what really can you say?\nMR. EARNEST: What we have made clear in a couple of different phone conversations is that the administration is committed to our nation's pursuit of a one-China policy rooted in three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act. This is a policy that's been in place for 40 years -- or almost 40 years, and it's a policy that has been aimed at promoting peace and stability in the Strait. And this has been a policy that has advanced the interests of the United States both in terms of advancing our relationship with China, but also in terms of the interests of the people of Taiwan, who happen to be the ninth-largest trading partner of the United States. So there are significant economic consequences here as well.\nQ: So, in saying that, are you expressing confidence to them that that policy will continue? Or do you really have no way of knowing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's the President-elect and his team who can speak to what sort of policy they intend to pursue after January 20th. I can't speak to that.\nQ: But you say that there have been a number of phone conversations with the Chinese government.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm aware of two different phone conversations with officials at the National Security Council with their Chinese counterparts.\nQ: Okay, great. Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin.\nQ: I wanted to return to Italy first. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what you anticipate it meaning for European refugee policy, and also if the administration -- if anybody in the Treasury Department or here at the White House has been in touch with sort of financial markets out of this concern that this could either impact the Euro, or kind of spark fears of a recession or a run on the banks -- all these different possible economic consequences.\nMR. EARNEST: There are obviously a range of potential contingencies any time there is a significant national election like this. It's no secret that the Treasury Department has been closely monitoring the financial system in Italy for some time now. There have been increased signs of volatility there. I'm certainly no expert on those issues so I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Treasury Department for an analysis.\nI know that a number of analysts have suggested that the market reaction is indicative of this being the anticipated outcome, but I'll let those analysts speak to that assessment. Obviously, the United States and Italy have an important economic relationship, and the United States benefits from Italy and the EU more generally making smart financial and economic decisions.\nWith regard to the potential consequences for the unity of the European Union, I think that remains to be seen. Obviously, this is not a -- the referendum was not on -- was not a question about Italy's relationship with the EU, but there are a range of broader potential consequences that I can't speak to. But obviously, there are some important political decisions for Italy in the near term in terms of Prime Minister Renzi submitting his resignation and the need to form a new government -- whether that's a caretaker government or another government is something that ultimately the Italian President will have some say on.\nBut, look, the United States and Italy have an extraordinarily important relationship. And that relationship was on display when Prime Minister Renzi was here at the White House just six weeks or so ago. And obviously, there's a deep cultural relationship between our two countries. There are many people who live in this country who proudly identify themselves as Italian-American. The security relationship between the United States and Italy is critical. Italy is a NATO member and has made important contributions to our counter-ISIL campaign, to the NATO effort in Afghanistan. And we obviously work closely and consult closely with Italy as we resolve some of the security concerns with regard to ISIL's presence in Libya.\nSo this is an extraordinarily important relationship to the United States and to our national security and to our economy. And that will continue to remain the case even as they work through some of the political challenges that they're currently facing.\nQ: I want to ask about the decision by the Army Corps to delay the Dakota access pipeline for an environmental review. I'm interested both in your general reaction, but also if the White House was in any way sort of in contact with the Army Corps or dictating this decision to sort of further --\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, I've indicated before that the White House was being regularly updated on the talks between concerned local residents and federal agencies, including the U.S. Army with regard to the construction of this infrastructure project. The White House did not and has not been dictating the outcome, but rather has been updated by the Army Corps on the negotiations.\nThe President, a couple of weeks ago, welcomed the indication from the United States Army and other government agencies to redouble their consultation with those communities that are most directly affected by the construction of this project.\nThis is typically the kind of principle that you would hear from conservative politicians -- that whenever the federal government is undertaking a project that has a direct impact on a local community or a local American citizen, that the rights to that person and that community should be very carefully considered.\nThere has been some criticism from self-described conservative politicians. Why they have reached a different conclusion in this case is something you'd have to ask them. It's curious to me. But I think more generally, the President believes that this kind of consultation between federal agencies and local communities is important, particularly when a local community has such a significant stake in the outcome or is so significantly affected by a project like this moving forward. And that was the case in this situation. And the result has been for this federal agency to determine that more study is required. But ultimately that was a decision that was arrived at by the agency -- in this case, the United States Army.\nQ: Protestors there obviously are happy with the delay, but there's been complaints throughout the last few weeks about some of the tactics that have been used by local law enforcement, whether it be using water cannons on freezing nights, or rubber bullets. I'm wondering what the White House's perception of the way local law enforcement has treated these protests is, and if there's been any consideration of sort of a federal intervention into the interaction between protestors and law enforcement.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any contemplated federal *interaction [intervention] at this point. What I am aware of is the very first thing that the President said publically about this matter earlier this fall. And the very first thing that he said was he encouraged protestors to abide by the responsibility that they have to exercise their constitutional rights to protest peacefully. They have that responsibility. The President also made clear that law enforcement officials who have a responsibility to keep that peace have a responsibility to handle themselves in a manner that would promote peace in watching over these protests. So that's important. And that's the responsibility that people on both sides of this issue have, and the President's expectation is that those are responsibilities that they should uphold.\nQ: One last one. President Rouhani said over the weekend that if President Obama did not block the Iran Sanctions Act there would be a \"firm response\" from Iran. I'm wondering what your reaction to that is, and especially your level of concern, considering that the Ayatollah and others in Iran have said continuing this legislation, even though it doesn't directly impose sanctions itself, would be a violation of the Iran nuclear deal.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've made clear since Congress was considering the passage of this legislation that this legislation was not inconsistent with the agreement that was reached in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- this was ultimately the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We've been clear about that from the beginning, and that's clear today. And in fact, we made clear that if Congress did pass legislation that undermined the deal that was inconsistent with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that the President would veto it.\nAnd given the support in the Congress for the deal, there was sufficient political support to ensure that the President could back up that promise. In this case, because the legislation doesn't undermine the deal and is not inconsistent with the agreement, the President does intend to sign it into law.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I've got two for you. The first one -- I'm trying to understand this outreach -- this conversation between the U.S. and China in the aftermath of the President-elect's phone call. They know that he doesn't speak for you guys and that you guys don't speak for him, so I'm trying to understand how your message of continuity of policy can get across to them. They've got to know, as you acknowledge, that in January, everything could change. So are you promising them that he's going to see the light somehow, or what's the message there?\nMR. EARNEST: No, there's no attempt and no effort and, frankly, no desire to make promises on behalf of the President-elect. When the President-elect assumes office, when he assumes the awesome responsibility of governing the greatest country in the world, that's something that he'll do on his own.\nThe assurances that we could offer the Chinese government were the ongoing commitment of the U.S. government to the pursuit of a one-China policy that we believe has benefitted the United States, China and Taiwan. But the Chinese government and senior officials in the Chinese government are sophisticated enough to understand the complexities of the U.S. political system and they understand that President Obama's ability to set our policy towards this region of the world expires on January 20th, and someone else will take over. Our message -- the message that was conveyed by senior National Security Council officials was intended to make clear that the policy position of the Obama administration had not changed.\nQ: And then could you give us a flavor -- we got a flavor of the speech tomorrow from Eric last week. Could you flesh it out a little bit more? What is the President's purpose in giving this speech tomorrow? Is this a legacy-minded assessment of his eight years in office on the foreign policy front? Is it about unfinished business? And to the degree that it is about unfinished business, is he planning on suggesting to the incoming administration that they finish that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a whole lot more to say about the speech for tomorrow. We'll try and get you some more information before the end of the day today, just as you prepare to write about the President's speech.\nI think, in general, what I can tell you is that the speech is focused on underscoring how important some of the reforms are that President Obama has put in place with regard to greater accountability and transparency in our national security programs. These reforms were necessary in part because, when President Obama took office our country was benefitting from new technology, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, to apply pressure to terrorist organizations and terrorist leaders in remote locations. And President Obama believed it was important and worth a lot of time and effort to impose some constraints on how that program was used and to make it more transparent.\nAnd the President's view is that by putting in place that legal architecture, it would make the program more durable. It would also inspire greater confidence around the globe in our ability to conduct these programs consistent with our values. And so much of the authority and influence the United States wields around the world is derived from our adherence to these universal values.\nSo I think the goal tomorrow is to help the American people understand why these reforms were so important, and understand why they're so valuable to our national security moving forward. There will be an acknowledgement that there is additional work in this area that needs to be done and will require thoughtful consideration by national security professionals in the next administration. But the President is quite proud of all of the progress that we have made, both in terms of keeping the country safe, but also in making sure that our country lives up to the values that are central to our greatness.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to know if the White House has any reaction to the arrest that was made yesterday at Comet Pizza up in Northwest. I'm asking because the President has spoken out a number of times on the corrosive effect that fake news has had on the political discourse, and I know that a lot of the rumors surrounding that establishment was spread by fake news online.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by complimenting and crediting local law enforcement here in the Washington area who responded with a lot of professionalism to that situation in preventing any bloodshed. So this is just another example of how our men and women in blue never take a day off from keeping us safe. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and that certainly applies to the brave men and women who serve in the Metropolitan Police Department here in Washington, D.C.\nThe second thing I can tell you is that those law enforcement officials are continuing to investigate this situation. I know there have been some interviews that have been conducted with the subject and I think there's some interest in trying to learn more about what exactly his motives were.\nI think more generally it's -- even without knowing precisely what those motives were, I think there's no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate. And that's concerning in a political context. It's deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.\nSo, again, it's unclear if that's exactly what happened in this situation. I'll let local officials speak to that. But this is something that I think everybody is going to spend some time thinking about, particularly people in this room and the people who represent news organizations in this room. How people understand what's happening in the world is important to the functioning of our democracy. And this is something that I assume the next administration is going to have to spend some time thinking about and working on as well.\nQ: Do you think the President-elect or his top advisors need to speak out about this problem, too? We've seen the son of Michael Flynn, the incoming national security advisor, spread some of the rumors about this pizza shop on his Twitter account. So given that, do you think that senior members of the Trump team need to respond?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not here to issue any specific challenges to the incoming administration on any topic. I think we all hold a responsibility, regardless of whether or not we are planning to serve in a government position or if one of our family members is planning to serve in a government position, that we shouldn't be propagating false things that could inspire violence. I think that's a -- there's probably some overlap of the Golden Rule there I think somewhere that may be worth considering.\nQ: Just lastly, there was a group of 22 Republican senators who sent a letter to President Obama today asking him to stop issuing any non-emergency rules and regulations in the final weeks of the administration. Just wondering if the White House has received that letter and if you have any response to it.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the letter, but it's not the first time we've been asked about a letter that purports to carry the same kind of message. And I think I'll just reiterate something that I think President Obama has said, which is simply that the rulemaking process in the Obama administration continues. And our goal is not to generate a bunch of new rules in response to the surprising election outcome, but rather to ensure that the rulemaking process that has long been underway is completed effectively and in a timely fashion before President Obama leaves office. And that's what we're focused on doing.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Any update on the situation in Oakland, California -- devastating fire there? Is there any federal response to what has happened there?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, Kevin, what happened in Oakland is a heartbreaking situation. Dozens of people who thought they were showing up to a party didn't go home. And it raises lots of questions that are still being carefully considered by investigators about building codes and what sort of precautions were put in place to ensure the safety of partygoers. And obviously, those precautions were woefully insufficient, and it's a tragedy.\nI can tell you that White House officials have been in touch with the mayor's office to offer our condolences and offer our support to local officials that are bearing a heavy burden. And this is another situation where you've got first responders who put themselves in harm's way to try to protect the public -- in this case, firefighters and EMTs that used their skill to save lives. And we're certainly grateful for that. But this is a community that's mourning and it's obviously a very sad turn of events.\nQ: Let me ask you about Gitmo. I understand there was indeed a transfer. Can you give us more details about that, and do you expect others this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer to my colleagues at the Department of Defense for the details. But there was one Guantanamo Bay detainee that was transferred to Cape Verde. This is an individual who will be subject to some security requirements that were negotiated in advance by the United States with the local government there to ensure that this individual does not pose an undue threat to our national security.\nThe population at Gitmo is now down to 59. And there are still at least a couple dozen of those individuals who are eligible for transfer, and we're continuing to do the diplomatic work of finding an arrangement for those individuals to be safely transferred to another country.\nQ: So it's still the President's intention to continue with the transfers but not necessarily close down the facility -- is that sort of a fait accompli at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, we're continuing to do this important work, and this is work that's rather painstaking in making sure that were carefully reviewing the files, putting the national security interests of the United States first, and doing the important work with countries around the world to try to find a suitable location where these individuals can be transferred.\nOur stated goal of closing the prison is still rooted in the ideas that closing the prison would be good for taxpayers because it's prohibitively expensive to continue to run it, and our view is also that continuing to have the prison open only serves to advance the recruiting interests of extremist organizations that do view the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as an effective recruitment tool.\nAnd this is not just an observation that was made by the Obama administration. Senior officials who served in President Bush's administration said the same thing and have advocated for the closure of the prison for the same reasons. So this has bipartisan support among national security professionals that this is a prison that should be closed. And we continue to be strongly opposed to the politically motivated effort by the Congress to prevent and obstruct the successful closure of the prison.\nQ: I want to last ask you about the comments you made earlier about what happened in Italy. You said it would be a mistake, you said, to oversimplify. But would you at least acknowledge the there is a populist wave that appears to be happening throughout Europe?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think that's overly stated just because we saw the outcome in Austria --\nQ: Would you also acknowledge, given that history in contributing -- one of their citizens being one of the most reviled in all of history might sort of set them separate. I'm not suggesting that they're somehow not from that community, the European Community, but I am suggesting is when you see what happened in France, Brexit, now Italy, there seems to be a building populism.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what is true is -- and this is true irrespective of the election outcomes -- I think it is true that there are people in Europe who are frustrated that the current state of the economy doesn't allow them to meet the aspirations that they have set for themselves and their family. And they are looking for answers.\nAnd the President made the point on a number of occasions that policymakers need to be focused on expanding economic growth and looking for ways to drive that growth, both by investing in the citizens of their country, but also in making investments in local markets to try to spur that economic growth. That would be good for the global economy but also would be good for the living conditions and the aspirations of the people in their country.\nAnd there's a reaction on the part of some people to give into the temptation to try to withdraw from the international community, the sense that there will be a bigger slice of the pie, so to speak, to enjoy if you build fences around the country and prevent other people from getting access to the pie. That actually flies in the face of a strategy that's rooted in using our interconnected, integrated world to grow the size of the pie, and give more workers the opportunity to succeed, and ensure that the economic growth and productivity and economic benefits of globalization are not just enjoyed by those at the top but that that prosperity is enjoyed by everybody.\nQ: Is that message winning?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think that this is a fundamental question that is facing leaders all around the world, not just in Europe, and there's a fundamental tension here that needs to be resolved. And, again, I think this is something that we can say irrespective of election outcomes because I think there's nothing that was on the ballot in Italy that was directly related to the EU or to the prospect of Italy leaving the EU. But, look, I think these are broader trends that leaders all around the world are going to have to confront.\nRon.\nQ: Just quickly on the Oakland fire. The federal involvement in that was just support, resources? Is that the extent of it now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the role of the federal government is to offer assistance to local officials who are dealing with the situation. And right now, local officials are engaged in a painstaking effort to comb through the remains of the fire in search of additional people who may have died in the fire, but also in carefully investigating this particular incident. And I know that some law enforcement officials have locally indicated their intent to consider this from a criminal angle. I'd refer you to them for the investigation.\nQ: That's the part I was wondering about. Is there federal concern about some of these issues that have been raised about inspections, about the -- that people were living in a place that apparently wasn't a home or a residential environment? Is that part of your -- the federal government's concern and involvement?\nMR. EARNEST: These regulations that relate to building codes and fire codes are something that are administered at the local level. So I'm not aware of any involvement by the Department of Justice in this matter, but you should check with them to confirm.\nQ: And just lastly on the transition. We're a few weeks into now, and I know you don't want to comment on specific appointments and so on and so forth, but there are a number of issues that have been raised about the President-elect's businesses and conflicts of interests, some appointees have raised some eyebrows -- the national security advisor, counsel to the President, the head of Health and Human Services, for example. There have been these phone calls with foreign leaders that have raised some issues. Is the President still satisfied with the way things are going? And you've said his goal was for a smooth and I think you even used the word successful transition. Does he still see that happening now, given where we are?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think this is a situation where the President is focused on making sure that this administration is doing everything possible that we can and doing everything that is under our control to facilitate a smooth and effective transition into the next presidency.\nObviously, this administration is not going to be in a position to offer them personnel advice or certainly not advice that would be unsolicited from the podium, or to try to help them craft what sort of policies they want to implement. If they're interested in the advice of members of the President's transition team, then they certainly know how to seek out that advice, and the President's team stands ready to share it. But ultimately, what the President and his team are focused on is making sure that we are taking everything that is under our control, and orienting it in the direction of ensuring a smooth and effective transition that will give the incoming President and his team the best opportunity to succeed at uniting and leading the country. Whether or not the incoming administration is oriented effectively to take advantage of that opportunity is something that you have to ask them about.\nQ: Increasingly, though, more is not under your control or the President's control. Is there some tension, some feeling that he has of his inability to shape events? And while, again, you're trying to make this effective and facilitate what the incoming administration wants to do, there's obviously these contradictions between what the President would like them to be doing versus what they are doing. How does he reconcile that? Is it just that the election has consequences and you just have to -- you can't throw your hand up and walk away? To what extent is he trying to influence events in terms of policy and so forth for the transition?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, what this President is trying to do is to make sure that his team is oriented in such a way that we can provide all of the cooperation and information that the next President's team requires to get off to a running start. And President Obama believes that that is in the best interest of the country to do that and that's why we are focused on that direction.\nLook, the truth of the matter is that even if Secretary Clinton had won the election, it's still likely that her team would be sending signals about making changes to policies that President Obama kind of liked. So this is the nature of a democracy and this is the nature of a peaceful transfer of power -- that the person who's been in office for eight years has to willingly give up power and give up influence and give up authority.\nQ: But sometimes that's very difficult to accept.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think that's -- well, I guess what I would say is that's the reason it doesn't happen in most places. Most countries in the world, they don't have this kind of process, and for most of human history, the process has been bloody and has been a transition by force. That's the genius of our system. And it does require the person who's currently sitting in that office to put the interest of the country ahead of its own political preferences. That's absolutely true. But that is a responsibility that President Obama has embraced, and the country is better off for it.\nMaggie.\nQ: You've announced that Prime Minister Abe will be visiting Pearl Harbor as the first Japanese Prime Minister to do so. This is right after President Obama went to Hiroshima as the first sitting U.S. President to do so since the bombing. Why are these historic visits happening now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, obviously the decision by Prime Minister Abe to travel to Pearl Harbor is a decision that he made, and he issued a statement today indicating that is he hopeful that his visit will be an indication of how adversaries have an opportunity to reconcile their differences and pursue a peaceful future together as allies. That's certainly what happened between the United States and Japan. And there are Presidents in both parties that have sought to advance those shared goals, and certainly Japanese prime ministers in a variety of parties that have sought to advance those shared goals. I know that Prime Minister Abe also indicated his desire to travel to Pearl Harbor as a show of respect for those who died on that day.\nSo, look, President Obama visited Hiroshima earlier this year. It was a powerful image seeing the American President and the Japanese Prime Minister standing side by side in that city. And I would expect that seeing the Japanese Prime Minister and the American President standing side by side in Pearl Harbor, at the memorial of the USS Arizona, just a couple of weeks after the 75th anniversary of that attack I think will be similarly powerful. And I think it is just one more occasion for us to remember the substantial sacrifice and the remarkable patriotism of the greatest generation of Americans.\nPresident Obama's grandfather played an important role in World War II in terms of signing up to fight for his country, and remembering that Greatest Generation of Americans, his grandfather is obviously at the forefront of his mind. But millions of Americans, I think, certainly can spend some time this week remembering the remarkable contribution and the remarkable sacrifice that millions of Americans made to ensure that the United States emerge victorious from World War II.\nQ: When President Obama visited Hiroshima, was this visit by the Prime Minister already in the works?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, there had always been a number of conversations between the U.S. President and the Prime Minister of Japan about the symbolic value of an American presidential visit to Hiroshima. And I know there had been discussions previously about the Japanese Prime Minister visiting Pearl Harbor, as well. I think if the two were directly linked, they probably would have been announced simultaneously, but they were not. But, look, there have always been discussions about these important symbolic gestures, and there's no downplaying the significance of the Japanese Prime Minister's decision to visit Pearl Harbor just three weeks after the 75th anniversary of the attacks there.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple of questions related to the transition and the President's stated commitment to it. First, there have been some Democratic senators on the Hill who have talked about seeing what happened to Chief Judge Garland, to now Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and saying that maybe they should kind of not really rush on President-elect Trump's nominees. The President knows how important it is to have people in his Cabinet when he's getting up and running. How does he feel about the idea of slow-walking Trump's nominees?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, there is the stated fact about the way that Chairman Grassley handled his business over the course of the last year, or couple of years. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the first African American woman to serve as the Attorney General of the United States, waited longer than her six or seven predecessors combined to be confirmed into that job. Why Republicans imposed that kind of delay on her candidacy and her nomination I think is something that only they can explain.\nWith regard to Chief Judge Garland, he has waited more than 200 days for action in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we've heard from Chairman Grassley a blanket refusal to even consider his nomination despite the fact he's got more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history, despite the fact that Republicans acknowledge that he represents a consensus pick, and despite the fact that he is somebody who has served his country bravely, including investigating and prosecuting the perpetrators of one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil.\nBut when President-elect Trump signals his intent to nominate an attorney general, Chairman Grassley kicks the squeaky wheels of the Senate judiciary conformation process into motion. And I do think it reflects an unprecedented injection of partisanship into what had previously been a committee that went to some length to try to prevent partisan politics from infecting the process.\nBut under the purview of Chairman Grassley, it's clear that the process hasn't just been infected but they've got a full-blown fever of partisanship. But when you are the Republican chair of the committee presiding over a partisan committee and considering the nominees of the Republican President, I guess it's smooth sailing. We'll see.\nQ: So he doesn't have advice or a sort of principled suggestion to Democrats about how they should handle --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think individual Senate Democrats are going to have to decide on their own. But I do feel confident that they'll consider the merits of the nominees that are handed down, but how they want to respond to that is something that will be ultimately left to them.\nQ: And a question that I want to distance from Ron's a little bit, but it's sort of along a similar line. You've talked about how -- and the President has talked about how important it is to have a smooth transition and how it's kind of his last big priority to really make sure that his staff is doing everything that they can to help the incoming Trump team. Is that incoming Trump team taking advantage of all that cooperation and information that -- and you used the word -- that the incoming President requires to have a successful start?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'll refer you to the President-elect to assess how well his transition team is performing. I'm not going to hand out grades from here. What I can tell you is that the President's team is focused on making sure we're doing everything we can to facilitate a smooth and effective transition. But ultimately, how well the President-elect is served by his team is something that he'll have to assess.\nQ: And so you or President Obama will not be issuing any sort of opinion or pulling back the curtain at all about how the process is actually going.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think that there are a number of ways in which we've tried to characterize exactly how the process is going, but I certainly wouldn't want me handing out a grade, if you will, to affect the ability of people to do their jobs. Ultimately, if I stand up here and sort of offer up a new assessment where, in my view, they may or may not have fallen short, that may not lend itself to the kind of cordial, professional, collegial relationships that will contribute to the most effective transition.\nSo this is just one of those situations that crops up all too frequently when I'm standing at this podium at least, where discretion is the better part of valor, I guess, a little bit here.\nGardiner.\nQ: Josh, this administration has made a huge priority out of responding to online threats from jihadists. You have a whole set of people at the State Department; you have them at the Pentagon; you've got people who have gone after those who posted these messages and killed them in the Middle East. The administration has gone to Silicon Valley and had conversations with Twitter and social medial companies about making sure they crack down on these jihadi threats. You had an entire set of businesses up here on Connecticut Avenue for months getting direct death threats, and they said that nothing was done about them. Is it only a priority if these are jihadi threats? And is it not a priority for this administration if businesses and normal people are getting death threats and being terrorized for months with no action on the part of this administration? Help me understand the difference there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, I would strongly disagree with the assessment that somehow the administration had not done anything to respond to this situation, particularly when it comes to violent threats. I'll refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Justice and the FBI for the role that they may have played in investigating those threats.\nI'd also refer you to the Metropolitan Police Department here in Washington for a discussion of any work that they may have done to ensure that the D.C. residents who were patronizing those establishments were able to do so safely.\nQ: Did you know the FBI investigated this and went after the people who had given those threats over the course of these many months, despite the fact that the business owners themselves say nothing has been done?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak about any sort of criminal investigations. I do know that it is a matter of standard practice that if people are threatened with violence, that that raises significant legal questions, and legal questions that must be checked out. And whether that is local law enforcement or federal law enforcement, that's something that they have to work out among themselves.\nObviously there's a joint terrorism taskforce that in some cases can pool resources to ensure that those investigations are conducted using the best practices that are maintained by individual agencies. But the safety and security of the public is the President's highest priority, and that's true when it comes to administering our national security policy around the globe, but it's also true when we're fighting crime here in the United States. And the administration has a quite strong record that we're proud of in terms of the impact of some of our crime-fighting policies and our investments in local law enforcement agencies on the overall crime rate.\nBut yes, I would quibble with the notion that somehow -- in fact, I wouldn't just quibble; I would strongly disagree with the notion that the administration had done nothing in the face of these threats.\nQ: I think everyone in this room has gotten threatening emails and threatening things on social media and the rest. Again, the administration specifically went to Silicon Valley, had these meetings to talk about what these companies were doing about their response to threats from abroad. I guess what I'm asking -- I've never heard you talk about what the administration is doing, even not just on a law enforcement basis but a policy basis, reaching out to these Silicon Valley companies. I mean, the President has recently been discussing the problem of fake news on Facebook. Why hasn't there been a concern -- a growing concern on the part of the administration about what seems to be a growing amount of vitriol directed at a variety of people, sometimes violent vitriol, within the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, I think over the course -- over the last year or two, you've heard the President I think speak quite bluntly about the rhetoric that was being used in the context of this political campaign, and the impact that that could have on the broader political debate and the climate -- political climate in the country. So I do think this is something that we have talked about, and it's something that the President is concerned that that kind of harsh, sometimes violent, rhetoric obscures legitimate policy debates that we should be having in this country.\nSo with regard to the role of Silicon Valley and some of these technology companies and the role that they can play in policing the standards for people who use their platform, I know that's something that they've had a broad internal debate about, as well.\nObviously, there are some important First Amendment issues that come into play when we're having this discussion. Those First Amendment issues aren't prioritized in the same way when we're talking about overseas terrorist organizations that don't enjoy the same kinds of protections that American citizens do.\nBut the same observation that I made about these technology companies with regard to the use by terrorists of these platforms also applies to some of the harsh rhetoric that we've seen. And it's simply this: That many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley didn't develop this technology to make it easier for hate to be propagated online. Their idea was to build a community where people could more effectively communicate and engage in commerce.\nSo they've got their own built-in interest in protecting the First Amendment rights of their users while also creating a community and a platform that people actually want to use. And yes, if you do administer a platform that is used extensively to propagate hate and to inspire acts of violence, well, I think most people are going to be less likely to use the platform.\nSo this is the kind of balance that these technology companies are going to have to strike, and it's something that I know that they've been grappling with for some time. In some cases, I know that they've been doing it even outside the context of politics.\nQ: Do you think the market just will have to police itself on that then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I don't think it necessarily has to be -- I think there is a -- given the First Amendment questions that are raised, the role for the government to play in all of this is going to be necessarily limited by that. But I don't think it eliminates the possibility that the U.S. government could contribute to a productive, fruitful conversation about the effective administration of these online platforms to ensure that people's lives aren't at risk.\nQ: What will happen to the Aleppo insurgents who don't leave? Russia says they will be regarded as terrorists and risk death. Can you help with that? These are obviously, in many cases, people who have been supported by the United States.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can say about this is that we know that it has been the strategy of the Syrian government, backed by the Russians and the Iranians, to bomb innocent civilians into submission. And the focal point of much of that bombing campaign has been eastern Aleppo.\nIt's a bloody tactic. It's disgraceful. And it's heartbreaking because of the scale of innocent lives lost. It's why the United States has been working so tenaciously through diplomatic channels to try to bring the bombing campaign and the violence to an end, or at least reduce it enough that innocent people can get out of harm's way and humanitarian assistance can be consistently provided.\nBut there hasn't been a willingness on the part of either the Syrians, the Russians or the Iranians to engage in that process particularly constructively, and at least in a way that would yield a sustainable outcome. Hopefully, that will change. Hopefully, there's more progress that we can make. And hopefully the Russians will show some renewed interest in this. And we would welcome that change. But far too many lives have been lost and, yes, it's true that even more are at risk because of the deplorable tactics that are used regularly by the Syrians with the support of the Russians and Iranians.\nQ: Josh, when the Prime Minister from Japan comes to the Pearl Harbor Memorial -- one of the reasons this hasn't happened for so long is the Japanese don't feel that they have anything to apologize for generally. They feel that the attack grew out of the oil embargo and all this. So how are veterans' groups going to react with Abe showing up and just sort of bowing but no apology? Is there not going to be an apology? And how do you think that's going to play in the United States? Because from the United States' point of view, of course, the Pearl Harbor attack was completely unjustified and a total surprise, and an act of total violence and war that was, from our perspective -- there is no justification for it whatsoever.\nSo, I mean, this was obviously a problem when the President went to Hiroshima -- there were people in Japan who believed the United States shouldn't have dropped the atomic weapon; we don't feel that way. So how is this going to play out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't want to prejudge at this point what Prime Minister Abe may choose to say when he visits Pearl Harbor. I think that most Americans would warmly receive the sentiment that he expressed in his statement earlier today. He indicated that he will visit Pearl Harbor, together with President Obama, to \"mourn the souls of the victims.\" He continued saying, \"I would like to express my resolve toward the future that the tragedy of wars should never be repeated again. At the same time, I'm hoping to make it an opportunity to send out a message about the value of reconciliation between Japan and the United States.\"\nSo again, I think the kind of sentiment that's being expressed by the Prime Minister of Japan is one that would be warmly received by most Americans. But, obviously, the benefits of a visit like this is it displays the kind of opportunity that lies for America's future, that lies ahead.\nNot long ago, within the lifetime of many Americans, the United States and Japan were at war. And hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of our citizens were killed in that war. And 70 years later, the United States and Japan actually have formed an alliance that has benefitted both our countries and our national security and our economy. And I think this visit further underscores the benefits of pursuing peace and reconciliation.\nQ: But you don't think people are going to sort of see the guy coming from a country that caused the deaths to occur saying simply, well, we'll mourn the deaths but I'm not going to say that I even feel bad about causing the deaths?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I can't speak for every single American and how they will respond to or react to this particular situation. If I were a World War II veteran who was drafted by the United States military to go and fight for our country overseas in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, I might feel quite embittered. And I think it would be a perfectly natural and understandable human reaction to not be particularly satisfied with the words of the Japanese Prime Minister.\nBut I think the thing that we know about the Greatest Generation of Americans is they're anything -- well, let me say it this way. This Greatest Generation of Americans, I think we take a risk if we underestimate their patriotism and their capacity to set aside their own personal interests and prioritize the ambition and opportunity of the American people.\nAnd so, yes, there may be some who feel personally embittered. But I'm confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness, not because they're personally satisfied by the words of the Prime Minister, but because they recognize how important this moment is for the United States. And that's certainly why they qualify to be described as the greatest generation.\nJared.\nQ: Josh, earlier you said that some of the calls by the President-elect could potentially undermine some of the progress that's been made with the relationship with China. You've also said and the President has said that we're in a situation where we have one President at a time. Do any of the calls or any of the other actions that have been taken at this point by the President-elect nibble around the edges or even take a big bite out of this concept of \"one President at a time\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I did not participate in any of the phone calls that the President-elect has made over the last several weeks.\nQ: But you're aware of the reaction to them.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I'm aware of the reaction to them but I'm not aware of what he said in them, so that's why it's hard for me to assess whether or not this would erode a principle that the President-elect and his team have strongly supported, which is the idea that there's one President at a time.\nQ: When we're talking about the President-elect still in his capacity as a private citizen, does anything that he's done approach a violation of the Logan Act, any prohibition against someone who's not in an elected office making arrangements on behalf of the state or government of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the finer points of the Logan Act, so there may be somebody else that you consult on that one.\nQ: Senator Cruz has said that he would rather the President-elect talk to Taiwan than talk to Cuba or Iran. What do you make of that statement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the first thing I would point out is that there are any number of American officials who are in touch with Taiwanese authorities on a regular basis.\nQ: He was talking about the implications of these unprecedented calls or thawing relationships that are long frozen.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the relationship between the United States and Taiwan is an unofficial one, but it's not frozen. After all, Taiwan is the ninth largest trading partner with the United States.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, are you saying that, in the White House view, the President-elect's phone call the Taiwan President or the phone call that he had with the Taiwanese President is a breach of the Shanghai Communiquй in and of itself?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what is clear -- I think this is just an objective fact -- for the last 40 or so years, there hasn't been another phone call between the President of the United States or a President-elect of the United States and President Tsai or one of her predecessors. So that's just a fact.\nWhat this administration has pursued very carefully is a one-China policy that promotes peace and stability in the strait. And that's served the United States well. It served our ability to work effectively with Chinese authorities, and it's also served our ability to work effectively with Taiwanese authorities. But if President-elect Trump and his team have a different goal in mind or a different strategy in mind, I'll leave it to them to articulate what those goals might be and what strategy they intend to pursue to achieve them.\nQ: Would the administration like a clarification of what their goals are?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not -- look, I'll leave it to the President-elect and his team to communicate what they would like about his strategy or the policy that they intend to pursue. I think what I can do is do my best to describe to you the strategy that we have pursued and the significant benefits that have been enjoyed by the United States and the American people as a result of that strategy.\nIf he's got a different strategy that he intends to pursue in pursuit of some different goals and some different benefits, then I'll leave it to him to articulate that. Thus far, I think it's kind of hard to see exactly what that would be when you consider that the reaction from the Chinese has been to ramp up or ratchet up their rhetoric that is aimed at Taiwan. I'm not sure how that benefits the United States, and I'm not sure how that benefits the United States relationship with Taiwan. I'm not sure how that benefits the Taiwanese people. I'm not sure how that benefits the U.S. relationship with China. But I'll leave it to the President-elect and his team to offer up those explanations.\nQ: And on the Pearl Harbor visit, is it your understanding that both leaders will be making speeches at that visit?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when President Obama visited Hiroshima, both leaders had an opportunity to make statements, but I think they stopped short of something that could be described as a speech. And I think in this setting, I would expect that you'll have an opportunity to hear from both leaders at the memorial site.\nQ: You said it was Prime Minister Abe's decision to come, but clearly it was coordinated with the White House, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it was. There were discussions. In fact, President Obama and Prime Minister Abe had an opportunity to discuss the potential of this visit when they spoke in Lima, at the APEC Summit just a few weeks ago.\nBill Press.\nQ: Josh, does the President have a candidate for the next head of the Democratic National Committee?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has not endorsed any of the candidates for DNC Chair, and I don't anticipate that he will.\nQ: So would you say then that of the three candidates remaining -- Jamie Harrison, or Ray Buckley, or Congressman Keith Ellison -- that the President would be happy with any one of the three as the next DNC Chair?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't anticipate that the President is going to weigh in particularly aggressively in support or against any of the candidates.\nQ: Well, that leads to my third question, which is, if the President has said that he recognizes that the Democratic Party needs a lot of work to get back on top and start winning, particularly at the state legislative level and governors races because of reinforcement -- so if the President really intends, and he says he's going to focus on that in his post-presidency, he's going to focus on that, wouldn't he have an opinion about the person that he's going to be working with as head of the DNC? Or wouldn't we expect him to?\nMR. EARNEST: He may. He just may not choose to express it.\nCheryl, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Okay, thanks. Just quick on the CR that expires Friday --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: -- have you heard from Capitol Hill? Are they going to have one --\nMR. EARNEST: Still haven't seen the bill, have we?\nQ: Haven't seen the bill yet. Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: No, we haven't. Look, I know there have been a number of discussions, including over the weekend, between officials on Capitol Hill and some officials at the White House. But this is a basic governing responsibility. Republicans have the strong majority in both the House and the Senate. They've already put off passing a budget once, back when the first deadline arose two and a half months ago. But, look, they've got a deadline to meet on December 9th, and hopefully they'll meet it.\nQ: Do you see this going into next week, maybe just a two- or three-day CR?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't hazard a guess about what the outcome looks like at this point. But like I said, the original deadline was September 30th. We're now in the first week in December. So hopefully Congress will get its act together, and the Republicans who lead both chambers of Congress will fulfill the most basic responsibility that Congress has, which is to pass a budget and ensure the government doesn't shut down.\nThanks, everybody.

These jobs pay 50 percent more than the average private-sector job. One recent analysis of 26 million job postings found that nearly half of all the jobs in the top quartile in pay require some computer-science (CS) knowledge or coding skills.\nAnd yet, CS remains largely missing from American K-12 education. By the most recent estimates, just 40 percent of K-12 schools report offering even a single computer-science course, and only 32 states currently allow students to count computer science towards core high school graduation requirements.\nThese challenges, and the growing relevance of computing to America's economy, cybersecurity, and national security, are why President Obama issued a bold call to action at the beginning of this year—in his final State of the Union address—to give every child the opportunity to learn computer science.\nSince then, 2016 has been a year of action in support of computer science. Fourteen new states have expanded CS education, more than 500 organizations have responded to the President's call to action, and a new AP-CS course launched this fall and is already being offered in more than 2,000 classrooms. Fifteen Federal agencies are coordinating efforts to expand CS education, with new investments and guidance. Twenty-seven governors have called on Congress to support CS education.\nMarking this year of progress, and kicking off the Computer Science Education Week 2016, the White House is announcing new actions in support of CS education.\nNew Actions Announced by the Administration Today\nFederal agencies are announcing new actions in support of Computer Science for All:\n•      National Science Foundation (NSF) is announcing today $20 million in planned investment in FY 2017 in support of CS education. These new investments will take place under the Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (CSforAll: RPP) program, building on NSF's $25 million investment in FY 2016. The program aims to better understand, through research and development, how to provide high-school teachers with the preparation, professional development, and ongoing support that they would need to teach rigorous computer-science courses; and K-8 teachers with the preparation they would need to integrate computer science and computational thinking into their classrooms.\n•      National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) will develop a CSforAll strategic framework in the coming year. The NSTC Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (CoSTEM) Federal Coordination in STEM Education Task Force's (FC-STEM) Computer Science for All Interagency Working Group will develop a strategic framework to guide Federal efforts to support the integration of computer science and computational thinking into K-12 education.\nThese new CS announcements will also complement Administration efforts to expand broader STEM learning opportunities:\n•      U.S. Department of Education's (ED) 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) is expanding its STEM partnerships in scale and scope. From an initial pilot collaboration between ED and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2013, which brought authentic STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) experiences to students at 20 21st CCLC sites across 3 states, this program will now reach students at more than 200 sites across 25 states and will involve collaboration among 5 Federal agencies: ED, NASA, National Parks Service (NPS), Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Through these Federal partnerships, students from groups typically underrepresented in the STEM fields will have access to high-quality, hands-on, inquiry-based STEM activities, as well as opportunities to connect directly with STEM professionals, to cultivate interest in the field and enhance college and career readiness. The 21st CCLC is a $1.1 billion formula-grant program dedicated to providing students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools with academic and enrichment opportunities during out-of-school time, including computer science.\nAdditional Actions in Response to the President's Call to Action\nToday, more than 250 different organizations are announcing new commitments, demonstrating the strong response to the President's call to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science.\nCumulatively, these steps will help:\n•      Build the resource and knowledge base for rigorous, inclusive computer-science education. This includes Intel funding the development of a culturally sensitive CS curriculum for Native-American high-school students; Mission Measurement building a \"CS and STEM-Genome\" to make data insights from successful CS- programs available to practitioners and policy makers; DevTech Research Group at Tufts University making CS inclusive by translating the ScratchJr coding resource for K-5 students into ten new languages; and Center for Advancing women in Technology (CAWIT) piloting a new interdisciplinary CS degree programs aimed at increasing participation of women in CS with $3 million in corporate investment.\n•      Increase access to computer science in schools. This includes new actions by schools, districts, and communities across the nation like the new CS4NH statewide initiative by the New Hampshire Department of Education, citywide efforts by the City of Philadelphia, and Houston Independent School District taking action to bring CS to 215,000 K-12 students; the National Council of Teachers of Math bringing CS training to their network of math teachers nationwide in partnership with Bootstrap; and the Inland CSforAll Summit bringing together districts, plus industry and community partners to kick-start CS education across the Inland Empire of California.\n•      Engage and inspire students year round. This includes Girls Who Code launching 5,000 new clubs serving an estimated 75,000 girls in grade 5-12; Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) along with 21 PBS affiliates providing free CS resources to students ages 5-8; the launch of a National Technology Field Trip Day with 30 industry partners already on board; and the Hispanic Heritage Foundation delivering coding education to 1,000 underrepresented students in 20 cities.\n•      Engage students during CSEdWeek 2016. This includes new CSEdWeek and Hour of Code resources from Cartoon Network, YouTube Kids, Edmodo, Microsoft and many more; Starbucks and CodeVA piloting \"Cuppa Code\" meetups to connect Virginia CS teachers with tech mentors; NCWIT leveraging the \"Hidden Figures\" film to highlight Black women in technology; the TechArt Hour of Code in which 10,000 girls will generate a living digital display; and 1,000 elementary school students competing in the Junior Botball Challenge in Oklahoma.\nFull details on all of today's announcements can be found here.", "timestamp": "2016-12-05", "title": "Fact Sheet: A Year of Action Supporting Computer Science for All"}

Policy. It is the policy of the United States to prevent the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species, as well as to eradicate and control populations of invasive species that are established. Invasive species pose threats to prosperity, security, and quality of life. They have negative impacts on the environment and natural resources, agriculture and food production systems, water resources, human, animal, and plant health, infrastructure, the economy, energy, cultural resources, and military readiness. Every year, invasive species cost the United States billions of dollars in economic losses and other damages.\nOf substantial growing concern are invasive species that are or may be vectors, reservoirs, and causative agents of disease, which threaten human, animal, and plant health. The introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species create the potential for serious public health impacts, especially when considered in the context of changing climate conditions. Climate change influences the establishment, spread, and impacts of invasive species.\nExecutive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999 (Invasive Species), called upon executive departments and agencies to take steps to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species, and to support efforts to eradicate and control invasive species that are established. Executive Order 13112 also created a coordinating body—the Invasive Species Council, also referred to as the National Invasive Species Council—to oversee implementation of the order, encourage proactive planning and action, develop recommendations for international cooperation, and take other steps to improve the Federal response to invasive species. Past efforts at preventing, eradicating, and controlling invasive species demonstrated that collaboration across Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial government; stakeholders; and the private sector is critical to minimizing the spread of invasive species and that coordinated action is necessary to protect the assets and security of the United States.\nThis order amends Executive Order 13112 and directs actions to continue coordinated Federal prevention and control efforts related to invasive species. This order maintains the National Invasive Species Council (Council) and the Invasive Species Advisory Committee; expands the membership of the Council; clarifies the operations of the Council; incorporates considerations of human and environmental health, climate change, technological innovation, and other emerging priorities into Federal efforts to address invasive species; and strengthens coordinated, cost-efficient Federal action.\nSec. 2. Definitions. Section 1 of Executive Order 13112 is amended to read as follows: \"Section 1. Definitions. (a) 'Control' means containing, suppressing, or reducing populations of invasive species.\n(b) 'Eradication' means the removal or destruction of an entire population of invasive species.\n(c) 'Federal agency' means an executive department or agency, but does not include independent establishments as defined by 5 U.S.C. 104.\n(d) 'Introduction' means, as a result of human activity, the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or placement of an organism into an ecosystem to which it is not native.\n(e) 'Invasive species' means, with regard to a particular ecosystem, a non-native organism whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm, or harm to human, animal, or plant health.\n(f) 'Non-native species' or 'alien species' means, with respect to a particular ecosystem, an organism, including its seeds, eggs, spores, or other biological material capable of propagating that species, that occurs outside of its natural range.\n(g) 'Pathway' means the mechanisms and processes by which non-native species are moved, intentionally or unintentionally, into a new ecosystem.\n(h) 'Prevention' means the action of stopping invasive species from being introduced or spreading into a new ecosystem.\n(i) 'United States' means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, all possessions, and the territorial sea of the United States as defined by Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988.\"\nSec. 3.

Doing so, I believe, not only supports the process of democratic decisionmaking, but also demonstrates the legitimacy and strengthens the sustainability of our operations while promoting mutual understanding with our allies and partners.\nThe United States has used military force and conducted related national security operations within legal and policy frameworks that are designed to ensure that such operations are lawful and effective and that they serve our interests and values. Consistent with my commitment to transparency, my Administration has provided to the public an unprecedented amount of information regarding these frameworks through speeches, public statements, reports, and other materials. We have attempted to explain, consistent with our national security and the proper functioning of the executive branch, when and why the United States conducts such operations, the legal basis and policy parameters for such operations, and how such operations have unfolded, so that the American people can better understand them.\nIn addition to the efforts we have made to date, there is still more work that can be done to inform the public. Thus, consistent with my Administration's previous efforts, by this memorandum I am directing national security departments and agencies to take additional steps to share with the public further information relating to the legal and policy frameworks within which the United States uses military force and conducts related national security operations. Accordingly, I hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1. Report. National security departments and agencies shall prepare for the President a formal report that describes key legal and policy frameworks that currently guide the United States use of military force and related national security operations, with a view toward the report being released to the public.\nSec. 2. Keeping the Public Informed. On no less than an annual basis, the National Security Council staff shall be asked to, as appropriate, coordinate a review and update of the report described in section 1 of this memorandum, provide any updated report to the President, and arrange for the report to be released to the public.\nSec. 3.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary as the Foreword to the report.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119877", "text": "From President Lincoln's issuance of the Lieber Code during the Civil War to our nation's leadership at the Nuremberg Trials following World War II, the United States has a long history of emphasizing the development and enforcement of a framework under which war can be waged lawfully and effectively, with due regard for humanitarian considerations, and consistent with our national interests and values.\nConsistent with this long tradition, since my first days in office I have underscored the importance of adhering to standards—including international legal standards—that govern the use of force. Far from eroding our nation's influence, I have argued, adherence to these standards strengthens us, just as it isolates those nations who do not follow such standards. Indeed, as I have consistently emphasized, what makes America truly remarkable is not the strength of our arms or our economy, but rather our founding values, which include respect for the rule of law and universal rights.\nDecisions regarding war and peace are among the most important any President faces. It is critical, therefore, that such decisions are made pursuant to a policy and legal framework that affords clear guidance internally, reduces the risk of an ill-considered decision, and enables the disclosure of as much information as possible to the public, consistent with national security and the proper functioning of the Government, so that an informed public can scrutinize our actions and hold us to account. When I took office, our nation was already years into a new and different kind of conflict against enemies who do not wear uniforms or respect geographic boundaries and who disregard the legal principles of warfare. Recognizing the novelty of this threat and the difficult legal and policy questions it raised and continues to raise, the United States complies with all applicable domestic and international law in conducting operations against these enemies. And, over the course of my Administration, I directed my team to work continually to refine, clarify, and strengthen the standards and processes pursuant to which the United States conducts its national security operations.\nThis report details the results of these efforts. It describes, among other things, how my Administration has ensured that our uses of force overseas are supported by a solid domestic law framework and consistent with an international legal framework predicated on the concepts of sovereignty and self-defense embedded in the United Nations Charter. And it describes how the United States has applied rules, practices, and policies long used in traditional warfare to this new type of conflict. In addition, the report recounts actions my Administration has taken to institutionalize a policy framework to ensure that, in carrying out certain critical operations, the United States not only meets but also in important respects exceeds the safeguards that apply as a matter of law in the course of an armed conflict—particularly in the areas of the preservation of civilian life, transparency, and accountability. For, as I have previously emphasized, to say that a military tactic is legal, or effective, is not to say that it is wise or moral in every instance.\nTo be sure, even with the release of this report today, there remains information about U.S. national security operations that we cannot disclose consistent with national security. Nor does this report address all conceivable legal aspects or justifications for the use of military force in every context or provide an exhaustive discussion of how the United States wages war. Rather, this report is intended to explain the domestic and international bases for the United States' ongoing use of military force overseas and to describe some of the key legal and policy frameworks my Administration has developed to govern such uses of force and related national security operations, such as detention, transfer, and interrogation operations. The report builds on a long line of public speeches and statements by members of my Administration that reflect my commitment to being as transparent as possible about how and in what circumstances the United States conducts national security operations. Even as working toward that degree of transparency can be challenging at times, it is ultimately critical to reinforcing the process of democratic decision-making, to demonstrating the legitimacy of our actions, and to reinforcing our relationships with our allies and partners.\nGiven the dynamic nature of today's security environment, the United States will no doubt continue to confront new issues as our nation's national security professionals work tirelessly to protect U.S. persons and interests. That is why, in conjunction with the release of this report, I am issuing a Presidential Memorandum that encourages future Administrations to build on this report and carry forward the principles of transparency it represents. In particular, the memorandum states that the National Security Council staff shall be asked, as appropriate, to update the report at least on an annual basis and to arrange for the report to be released to the public.\nThrough this report, I hope to enhance the public's understanding of the legal and policy principles that have guided U.S. national security operations, and to reinforce the fact that we defend our interests at home and around the world in a manner consistent with the laws, values, and traditions that are the source of our greatest strength.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-05", "title": "Statement on Releasing the \"Report on the Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding the United States' Use of Military Force and Related National Security Operations\""}

In this context, the United States has deployed U.S. combat-equipped forces to enhance the counterterrorism capabilities and support the counterterrorism operations of our partners and allies. Specific information about counterterrorism deployments to select countries is provided below, and a classified annex to this report provides further information.\nMilitary Operations Against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and Associated Forces and in Support of Related U.S. Counterterrorism Objectives\nSince October 7, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces, including special operations forces, have conducted counterterrorism combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces. Since August 2014, these operations have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was formerly known as al-Qa'ida in Iraq. In support of these and other overseas operations, the United States has deployed combat-equipped forces to a number of locations in the U.S. Central, Pacific, European, Southern, and Africa Command areas of operation. Such operations and deployments have been reported previously, consistent with Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, and operations and deployments remain ongoing. These operations, which the United States has carried out with the assistance of numerous international partners, have been successful in seriously degrading al-Qa'ida's capabilities and brought an end to the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan. If necessary, in response to terrorist threats, I will direct additional measures to protect U.S. citizens and interests. It is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to counter terrorist threats to the United States.\nAfghanistan. As I previously announced, U.S. Armed Forces have transitioned the lead for security to Afghan security forces while striking significant blows against al-Qa'ida's leadership and preventing Afghanistan from being used to launch attacks against the United States. A limited number of U.S. forces remain in Afghanistan for the purposes of, among other things, training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces; conducting and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of core al-Qa'ida and against ISIL; and taking appropriate measures against those who directly threaten U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al-Qa'ida. The United States remains in an armed conflict, including against the Taliban, and active hostilities remain ongoing.\nThe mission to help train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Security Forces and Afghan ministries and institutions continues through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led Resolute Support Mission. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2189, dated December 12, 2014, which welcomed the Resolute Support Mission and underscored the importance of continued international support for the stability of Afghanistan.\nThe Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan currently is 9,800. Effective January 1, 2017, the Force Management Level for Afghanistan will be 8,448. (The actual number of U.S. military personnel may exceed the Force Management Level due to certain forces being excluded from counting against the Force Management Level; for example, incoming and outgoing forces that overlap during rotations of units do not count against the Force Management Level.)\nIraq and Syria. As part of a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, U.S. Armed Forces are conducting a systematic campaign of airstrikes and other necessary operations against ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria. United States Armed Forces are also conducting airstrikes and other necessary operations against al-Qa'ida in Syria. In Iraq, U.S. Armed Forces are advising and coordinating with Iraqi forces and providing training, equipment, communications support, intelligence support, and other support to select elements of the Iraqi security forces, including Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Additionally, small teams of U.S. special operations forces have deployed to Syria to help coordinate U.S. operations with indigenous ground forces conducting operations against ISIL. The Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq currently is 5,262. The Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Syria is 300.\nActions in Iraq are being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq, and in conjunction with coalition partners.\nTurkey. Strike and combat support aircraft, with associated U.S. military personnel, remain deployed to Turkey to support counter-ISIL operations and to support the defense of Turkey, at the Turkish government's request.\nSomalia. In Somalia, U.S. forces continue to counter the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its Somalia-based associated force, al-Shabaab. United States forces also advise, assist, and occasionally accompany regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces, during counterterrorism operations. United States forces also conducted strikes in defense of U.S. forces, and in defense of partnered Somali and AMISOM forces, on June 21, July 20, July 31, August 31, September 25, and September 28, 2016.\nYemen. The U.S. military also has been working closely with the Government of Yemen to operationally dismantle and ultimately eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). A small number of U.S. military personnel are deployed in Yemen to support operations against AQAP, including support for operations to capture AQAP leaders and key personnel. Our efforts have resulted in direct action against a limited number of AQAP operatives and senior leaders in that country who posed a terrorist threat to the United States and our interests. United States forces have conducted a number of airstrikes against AQAP combatants in Yemen since my June 13, 2016, update report, including on July 1, July 4, July 8, July 16, August 4, August 24, August 30, September 4, September 20, September 22, September 23, September 29, October 6, October 18, October 21, November 20, November 24, and November 30, 2016.\nDjibouti. United States forces continue to partner with Government of Djibouti authorities, which have permitted use of Djiboutian territory for basing of U.S. forces. United States forces remain deployed to Djibouti, including for purposes of posturing for counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula and contingency support for embassy security augmentation in East Africa, as required. Libya. United States forces continue to conduct airstrikes against ISIL targets in Libya, including in support of efforts by forces aligned with the Libyan Government of National Accord to recapture the city of Sirte from ISIL. These airstrikes are conducted at the request of and with the consent of the Government of National Accord.\nCuba. Combat-equipped forces, deployed since January 2002 to the Naval Base, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, continue to conduct humane and secure detention operations for detainees held at Guantánamo Bay under the authority provided by the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), as informed by the law of war. There were 59 such detainees as of the date of this report.\nJordan. At the request of the Government of Jordan, approximately 2,300 U.S. military personnel are deployed to Jordan to support counter-ISIL operations and the security of Jordan and to promote regional stability. These forces will remain in Jordan, in full coordination with the Government of Jordan, until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed.\nMilitary Operations in Niger in Support of U.S. Counterterrorism Objectives\nUnited States military personnel in Niger continue to provide support for counterterrorism intelligence collection and to facilitate intelligence sharing with French forces conducting counterterrorism operations in the Sahel and with other partners in the region. The total number of U.S. military personnel deployed to Niger is approximately 575.\nMilitary Operations in Cameroon in Support of U.S. Counterterrorism Objectives\nApproximately 285 U.S. military personnel are deployed to Cameroon, with the consent of the Government of Cameroon, to conduct airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in the region. These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security, and they will remain in Cameroon until their support is no longer needed.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY\nUnited States military personnel with appropriate combat equipment remain deployed to various countries in the central Africa region to serve as advisors to regional forces of the African Union Regional Task Force that are working to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and other senior Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leaders from the battlefield and to protect local populations. Additional information about military operations related to the LRA is provided in the classified annex.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE RED SEA\nAs I previously reported, on October 12, 2016, U.S. forces conducted missile strikes on radar facilities in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. These strikes were in response to anti-ship cruise missile attacks perpetrated by Houthi insurgents on U.S. Navy warships in the international waters of the Red Sea on October 9 and October 12.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN EGYPT\nApproximately 700 military personnel are assigned to or supporting the U.S. contingent of the Multinational Force and Observers, which have been present in Egypt since 1981.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE SECURITY OF U.S. CITIZENS AND PROPERTY IN SOUTH SUDAN\nAs I reported in July 2016, U.S. military personnel with appropriate combat equipment are deployed to South Sudan to support the security of U.S. citizens and property in South Sudan, including of our Embassy in Juba. These forces will remain in South Sudan, in full coordination with the Government of South Sudan, until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed. The forces that were deployed to Uganda to support this mission have redeployed to Djibouti or their home stations in Europe.\nU.S./NATO OPERATIONS IN KOSOVO\nThe U.N. Security Council authorized Member States to establish a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Resolution 1244 on June 10, 1999. The original mission of KFOR was to monitor, verify, and, when necessary, enforce compliance with the Military Technical Agreement between NATO and the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia), while maintaining a safe and secure environment. Today, KFOR deters renewed hostilities in cooperation with local authorities, bilateral partners, and international institutions. The principal military tasks of KFOR forces are to help maintain a safe and secure environment and to ensure freedom of movement throughout Kosovo. The U.S. contribution to KFOR is approximately 774 U.S. military personnel out of the total strength of approximately 4,475 personnel.\nI have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional and statutory authority as Commander in Chief and as Chief Executive (including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40 and other statutes), as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. Officials of my Administration and I communicate regularly with the leadership and other Members of Congress with regard to these deployments and we will continue to do so.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-05", "title": "Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Global Deployment of United States Combat-Equipped Armed Forces"}

Luetkemeyer, R-MO, and 39 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5143, the Transparent Insurance Standards Act of 2016. This legislation would roll back critical Wall Street reforms intended to protect American consumers and our financial system. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) created important and necessary changes to regulatory authorities and coordination for the insurance industry. H.R. 5143 would severely weaken these reforms, which were put in place to enhance insurance industry oversight in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Nation has made great progress as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and cannot allow this bill to hamper the United States' ability to implement the best standards for our unique regulatory regime. The restrictions that this legislation seeks to place on United States representatives in international insurance matters under H.R. 5143 would raise serious constitutional concerns and severely outweigh any potential attendant benefits.\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, and specifically after the near-collapse of American International Group, Inc. (AIG), the Dodd-Frank Act established a new supervisory and regulatory framework to examine financial stability risks in the insurance industry both domestically and internationally. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), which is directed in part to \"coordinate federal efforts and develop federal policy on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including representing the United States, as appropriate, in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and assisting the Secretary in negotiating covered agreements.\" The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the scope of the Federal Reserve's supervisory authority so that it now serves as the consolidated supervisor of insurance holding companies that own either a Federally chartered thrift or a bank, as well as non-bank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). FIO, the Federal Reserve, and state insurance commissioners are all actively engaged at the IAIS and regularly coordinate with one another, ensuring that each aspect of the unique United States regulatory regime is adequately represented in any international negotiation. Despite their effective coordination and extensive work thus far to improve global insurance regulation, the restrictions which H.R. 5143 seeks to impose would stop this work in its tracks and would put in place cumbersome and counterproductive requirements.\nH.R. 5143 would purport to prescribe strict negotiating objectives for United States representatives in international fora regarding international insurance standards, and establish several new processes and reporting requirements to be completed before any standard could be agreed to. These requirements would contravene the President's exclusive constitutional authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations. They also would add significant delays and limitations to the process for developing an international insurance capital standard, ultimately weakening the United States' ability to negotiate effectively for standards that best accommodate our unique regulatory regime.\nSpecifically, under H.R. 5143, FIO and the Federal Reserve would not be allowed to agree to international insurance standards unless, among other things, such standards are first published in the Federal Register and made available for public comment for 30 days. If this prohibition applied to the mere negotiation and conclusion of such agreements, it would violate the President's exclusive constitutional authority to conduct international negotiations. Even construed to avoid unconstitutional application, this type of requirement would significantly impair U.S. interests at both the IAIS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and limit the ability of the United States to influence decisions made at the IAIS, which could result in international insurance standards being adopted that are not in the best interests of U.S. consumers, the U.S. insurance industry, and the U.S. economy.\nFurthermore, H.R. 5143 would require the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative to \"consult with and directly include State insurance commissioners\" in negotiation of written bilateral or multilateral agreements regarding insurance or reinsurance. Although the President may choose to permit such consultation and involvement, as has been done already, the President's authority to determine who will represent the United States in international negotiations is exclusive, and the Congress may not dictate these choices for him.\nFinally, the bill would limit the amount available to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through its mandatory Reserve Fund, established by the Dodd-Frank Act. This cut to SEC resources is completely unrelated to international insurance standards and would negatively impact the SEC's ability to fund the long-term information technology initiatives that are necessary to keep pace with industry's increasing use of new and technologically-complex financial products and services.\nBecause this legislation seeks to tie the hands of U.S. representatives, in an unconstitutional manner, and prevent them from effectively negotiating on international insurance matters, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5143.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5143, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-12-06", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5143 - Transparent Insurance Standards Act of 2016"}

Trump today announced his intent to nominate General James Mattis, retired U.S. Marine Corps four-star general, to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of Defense. Among the most decorated and legendary leaders in our country, Gen. Mattis has spent his life defending America in numerous theaters of war.\nGen. Mattis commanded at multiple levels during his 44 year career as an infantry Marine. Before retiring in 2013, he was the Commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), directing military operations of more than 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines across the Middle East. Gen. Mattis has been at the forefront of the development of our nation's counterinsurgency tactics, and has earned accolades for his ferocity, intellect and dedication, making him one of the foremost defense experts in the world.\n\"I am proud to nominate General James Mattis to Secretary of Defense,\" said President-elect Trump. \"He is one of the most effective generals and extraordinary leaders of our time, who has committed his life to his love for our country. General Mattis is the living embodiment of the Marine Corps motto, 'Semper Fidelis,' always faithful, and the American people are fortunate that a man of his character and integrity will now be the civilian leader atop the Department of Defense. Under his leadership, we will rebuild our military and alliances, destroy terrorists and face our enemies head on, and make America safe again.\"\n\"I am honored by President-elect Trump's nomination and his respect for the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States,\" said Gen. Mattis. \"To the President-elect, our soon to be commander in chief, to our military personnel, to the talented civilians in the Department of Defense, and to the American people, I pledge the best of my abilities to ensuring a strong and secure America.\"\nGen. Mattis is a native of Pullman, Washington. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Central Washington University and was commissioned a second lieutenant through ROTC in 1972.\nAs a lieutenant colonel, Gen. Mattis commanded an assault battalion breaching the Iraqi minefields in Operation Desert Storm. As a colonel, he commanded the 7th Marine Regiment and, on Pentagon duty, he served as the Department of Defense Executive Secretary. As a brigadier general he was the Senior Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\nFollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Gen. Mattis, led the Special Operation Forces against the Taliban in Afghanistan. As a major general, he commanded the First Marine Division during the initial attack and subsequent stability operations in Iraq. As a general, he served concurrently as the Commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command and as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation.\nAs a two-star general, Gen. Mattis led the First Marine Division from Kuwait to Baghdad in a matter of weeks in 2003, annihilating Saddam Hussein's defenses and reaching Baghdad faster and with fewer losses than anyone could have expected.\nIn November 2007, Gen. Mattis was promoted to four-star general. He became Commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in 2010 and directed operations across the Middle East before retiring in 2013. Working closely with Gen. Petraeus, Gen. Mattis produced the revolutionary Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, the definitive work on how the U.S. military should deal with Iraqi insurgents. He is co-editor of the book, Warriors & Citizens: American Views of Our Military.", "timestamp": "2016-12-06", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

James N. Mattis to be secretary of defense so soon after taking off his military uniform. But President Obama's former defense secretary Leon Panetta believes Mattis should get the waiver and the job, he told me in an interview.\n\"It's important that the Congress in the process of providing that waiver makes sure that Jim Mattis understands that he has to play a role not just on the military side but also on the civilian side. I think he does,\" Panetta told me on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday.\nPanetta also said the 1947 law mandating that a defense secretary be out of uniform for 10 years — later changed to seven — was \"arbitrary\" and was crafted in a different era when generals had a singular role as war fighters, whereas today's generals have more diverse roles.\n...\nPanetta told me that Mattis often differed with the Obama White House on policy and wasn't shy about it. He often called internally for more military presence in the Middle East to send signals to Iran. Sometimes Obama accepted his recommendations and sometimes he did not.\nFor example, after Iran shot down an American drone in 2011, Mattis recommended Obama send fighter escorts for drone flights to show the Iranians such moves were unacceptable and Obama agreed. But in 2012 Mattis wanted a third aircraft carrier group deployed in the region to respond to Iranian maritime aggression in the Strait of Hormuz, something the White House rejected.\n\"Sometimes his attitude rubbed some people in the White House the wrong way, because he was aggressive,\" said Panetta. \"It never made him hesitate to keep saying what he believed was necessary.

EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Tampa, Florida, home of Central Command and Special Operations Command. The President will have an opportunity before his speech today to spend some time with the military leadership on the base to get a briefing from them on some of the important work that they're doing around the world to keep us safe.\nHe'll also have an opportunity to briefly spend some time with some of our servicemembers -- rank-and-file servicemembers, as well. And you will all have an opportunity to see him briefly address them and shake some hands before he moves to the venue where he'll deliver his more formal speech. And there will be a number of servicemembers in attendance at this speech, as well.\nYou all got an update on the speech from the Deputy National Security Advisor yesterday afternoon, so I won't review all of that, although I'm happy to take any questions you may have about that in advance of the speech. The speech has not changed significantly since all of you heard from Ben yesterday.\nThe one thing I did want to point out before I get to your questions is, in addition, the administration has also put forward what we're describing as the legal and policy transparency report. And the President will discuss in the speech why that report is so important. It puts in one place the legal foundation of the national security strategy and operations that President Obama has ordered over the last several years. There are many features of that strategy that benefit the American people. One of them is ensuring that those programs and those operations are grounded in our values. And President Obama has talked at length over the course of the last eight years about how important it is for our national security strategy to live up to the central values that we hold dear in this country and that, frankly, we're fighting for around the world.\nThere are many people on the President's staff who contributed to the production of this report. There's one person that I want to single out, though, and that's Chris Fonzone. Chris is the legal advisor to the National Security Council. Chris has served in a variety of senior legal jobs on the national security team both at the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense before joining the National Security Council.\nAnd he spent countless hours working an interagency process to ensure that this report could be both compiled and released publicly. Obviously, there's a lot of sensitive information that's included in this report. And he did remarkable work. And his skill and professionalism in carrying out that work is worthy of recognition, and that's what I'm trying to do here.\nSo with that out of the way, why don't we take your questions on this topic or anything else that might be on your mind this morning.\nQ: Is that report a rules of engagement report for the military or for intelligence operators?\nMR. EARNEST: This is essentially a report that lays out the administration's legal thinking about the military strategy and counterterrorism operations that this administration has carried out over the last eight years. And President Obama has talked about the legal underpinnings of this strategy in a variety of settings over the last eight years. And the idea here was to put together a report that would essentially, in one place, help the American people and people around the world understand exactly how the operations that we're carrying out are consistent with U.S. law and consistent with our values.\nSo one prominent example of this is -- it includes a discussion of how we definitively have ruled out the use of torture and interrogation. It also talks about the steps that the President has taken to provide a legal architecture for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in carrying out counterterrorism operations. When President Obama took office, there was a lot of legal ambiguity about how these programs could be used to keep the American people safe. And the President believed -- has long believed that those programs would be more effective and inspire greater public confidence in the effective use of those programs if we were more transparent about the use of those programs and if we were clearer about the legal underpinnings of those programs.\nSo that's what we have done in this report, and the President has essentially made clear that this is a report that will now be produced on an annual basis by the administration and by administrations moving forward.\nQ: Are you also trying to give President-elect Donald Trump kind of a firm grounding of the legal underpinnings for your strategy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to just be crystal-clear about this, as was suggested by the way that I described the effort to produce this report, this was not something that we had scrambled to produce in the aftermath of the election. This is a report that the President long envisioned making public, and it is his view that this is the kind of report that will not just support the policymaking of the next administration, it is likely to be a report that will be useful in guiding the policymaking of multiple administrations moving forward. This provides a legal foundation that future policymakers can draw on as they devise and adapt our counterterrorism and national security strategies to the modern threat environment.\nAnd so the idea is that future presidents can use this venue to help the American people and even help the world understand exactly what the legal justification is, what the legal underpinnings are for carrying out these programs. And the President believes that it's important to codify that legal reasoning because it makes these programs more durable, it ensures that these programs live up to the values that we embody as a country. As soon as those values are called into question, the kind of moral authority that we bring to these operations and we bring to these arguments around the world is called into question and is even threatened. And so much of our strength is strength that we draw on from our close cooperation and alliances with countries around the world, and our ability to strengthen those alliances is called into question if our reasoning for carrying out these operations is called into question.\nQ: Why release this report at the end of your administration? I mean, doesn't that kind of diminish the significance of it? I mean, wouldn't it have been more useful for the American people to know about the legal framework for your actions while they were going on? Presumably, the next administration -- yes, they could use it, or they could completely trash it and decide to do something different, or try to take a different look at it. So I guess I'm trying to see what is the -- if the next administration doesn't use it, then what's the point of it, what's the force?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, the first thing to understand is that we live in a nation of laws, and these are laws that are applied that constrain the authority of the executive branch. That's how it should be.\nSo hopefully we will not encounter a situation in which the next administration or subsequent administration has roughshod over those laws. But particularly when we're in an environment where we are at war against terrorists, there's a temptation to do that. And the President is using this opportunity to lay out his thinking for why we should resist that temptation.\nThe second thing I would want to make clear is, many of these arguments are not being presented for the first time in this report. The President has spoken at length in a variety of settings about the legal underpinnings of these programs, about bringing greater -- the process for bringing greater transparency for these programs. As we've issued reports, for example, about additional drone strikes carried out by the United States military, just setting that example and setting that precedent is useful in trying to model and establish guidelines for subsequent administrations.\nSo a lot of the work that we have been doing over the years does serve to support the case that we are making to the American public and to the incoming administration about the value of drawing on these values and principles as they design a counterterrorism strategy that is consistent with the threat environment that we face.\nSo the last thing I'll say about this is that this report is being released in conjunction with the regular notification that the administration provides to Congress pursuant to the War Powers report, and that is something that we've done on a semiannual basis. And so that seems like an appropriate timing for us to not just update Congress about the operations that are ongoing around the world, but also to supplement that report with this policy and legal guidance that helps Congress, that helps the American people, and that helps people around the world understand the legal justification for carrying out these operations.\nQ: Josh, on the very sensitive issue of the use of torture, which has been highly debated during the campaign, to what extent will the President's speech be also a message to the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned before, Jerome, this is a speech that President Obama was prepared to give before the election. And the President does view this as an opportunity to lay out how the American people have benefitted from the counterterrorism strategy that this country has pursued over the last eight years, and this is a strategy that relies on strengthening our alliances, drawing upon our values, and enhancing the capacity of our partners on the ground in countries around the world to be at the front lines of this fight.\nOne example that the President will cite is the experience that we've had in Iraq. The previous administration had a strategy of invading Iraq and overrunning the Iraqi military, disbanding the Iraqi military, and essentially putting U.S. servicemembers on the front lines of that fight. That required a substantial commitment of resources, both financial resources of taxpayers but also the personal resources of the United States military.\nPresident Obama envisioned a vastly different strategy -- a strategy where we demanded political accountability from the central government in Iraq, demanded that they pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that would be required to unite their country to take that fight to the terrorists on their own. And that is what we have seen them do. They have done that with the strong support of the United States. As a result, we have succeeded in rolling back ISIL. We've rolled them out of territory -- about half the territory that they previously controlled. They are under intense pressure in cities like Mosul and in Raqqa. And we have mobilized the international community to support that effort, and that has strengthened the United States.\nIt's also notable that we've been able to do all of that at a cost of about $10 billion over the last two years. That's a substantial sum of money. But at the height of the Iraq War that was pioneered by President Bush, that was costing $10 billion a month. So the strategy that President Obama has put in place is more effective. It keeps us safer. It has fewer men and women -- American men and women in harm's way. And it costs American taxpayers a whole lot less. It also has the benefit of being sustainable.\nAs the Iraqi security forces make additional progress in securing their own country, once they've driven out ISIL, they can also take responsibility for policing and securing their country. And that is something that previously was left to U.S. servicemembers. And when we tried to transfer that authority to Iraqi security forces, it didn't work.\nSo that's just one example of the kind of argument that the President will be making that I think will be persuasive to Americans in both parties who believe that the Commander-in-Chief has a responsibility to the American people to prioritize our national security, to prioritize the wise use of our military resources, and to prioritize the judicious use of taxpayer dollars.\nQ: Josh, but as part of this transparency effort, Representative Schiff in the last couple days has talked about the release of the Senate torture report and the possibility that you guys would sort of declassify more of that than came out in the executive summary that the Senate provided. Is that anything that the President is considering or that we might hear about today?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not anticipate that you'd hear much from the President on this today. But this is a report that was released in the context of the Obama administration. It was produced by Congress. And a declassified portion of the report, including the executive summary, was released. And it did provide extensive information about some of the tactics that were used by the previous administration that, in the mind of the President, at least, are inconsistent with the kinds of values that we cherish in this country.\nAnd the President believes that ensuring that our counterterrorism programs are rooted in our values makes those programs more effective, more sustainable, it inspires greater confidence in those programs, and it makes it easier for us to strengthen our alliances. Because ultimately our ability to fight terrorism successfully is going to require effective cooperation with our allies and partners around the world.\nQ: Can I ask about the budget? And I've got three things, so I'll try to go pretty quick on it. The first is, Paul Ryan said today that he anticipates the CR going to April 28th. That's barely not May, which you guys have sort of objected to in the past, but I'm wondering if that's an acceptable sort of timeline, or if you had carried the same objection.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, they have not released the text of the CR, and so I'm not going to comment in a lot of detail about the proposal until we've had a chance to take a look at it for ourselves.\nI will just reiterate, though, the significant concerns that were raised by Secretary Ash Carter, who said that the extension of a continuing resolution all the way until May would hamstring the ability of the Department of Defense to do everything that they believe is necessary to keep the American people safe.\nSo that's not a feature -- that's not an advertised feature of their proposal that is appealing to the Obama administration. And it's something that our national security professionals are quite concerned about. But I'm going to reserve judgment on the bill until we've had a chance to take a look at it.\nQ: And also, talk about a rider that would help General Mattis and his confirmation hearings by sort of clearing the waiver process now -- is that something that -- Senate Democrats have sort of voiced opposition to that. Is that something that the White House would oppose to if it was added to the CR?\nMR. EARNEST: I've heard some rumors that there's the potential this could be included in the CR, but we'll take a look on what they put forward -- we'll take a look at what they put forward before we pass judgment on that specific proposal.\nQ: And then finally, there seems to be some Democrat-on-Democrat crime with the water bill right now. Senator Boxer said that Republicans have added essentially a poison pill. I'm wondering if you guys agree with that assessment. This is regarding sort of the northern California-to-southern California water allocation and dam building environmental concerns, that sort of thing.\nMR. EARNEST: We have been briefed on this measure. I can tell you in general that we continue to review the bill. But based on what we know so far, we don't support the kinds of proposals that have been put forward to address some of the water resources issues in California right now.\nSo we don't support that measure that's been put forward, but we'll take a look at the bill in its totality. And there's more of those -- more proposals that are included in the bill that we need to review.\nThe thing I want to hasten to add, though, is Republicans should not use the disagreement in California as an excuse to break their promise that they made to the people of Flint to provide resources to address the situation with the water supply in Flint, Michigan. This is a promise that Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate made to provide resources to address that situation before the end of this year.\nWe're nearing the end of the first week in December. And we know that plenty of Republicans are hoping to get out of town and begin their holiday celebrations at the end of this week. They should not do so until they have fulfilled their promise to the people of Flint who are waiting for the United States Congress to actually do something to address the difficult situation that they're facing there.\nQ: Josh, President-elect Trump said this morning that he was going to cancel the Air Force One project. He said it was way too expensive. You all obviously have administered that project. What's your reaction to that? Also, today, in the Washington Post there was a long story about a Pentagon savings report that the Washington Post reported was suppressed by this administration.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's talk about Air Force One first. I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense for the particulars of the procurement contract. Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense. But I would acknowledge that these kinds of arrangements are rather complicated, so I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense for a greater explanation.\nA couple of things that are worth understanding. The first is, all of you have spent many hours on Air Force One and recognize the unique technical requirements that are part of Air Force One. And I think the American people would expect that future U.S. Presidents would benefit from unique and upgraded capabilities while they're traveling on Air Force One and representing the interests of the United States around the world.\nSecond, I would just make clear that the work that the Department of Defense has been doing on this project with Boeing comes at the recommendation of national security experts and other technical experts offering them advice about the kinds of capabilities that should be included in an updated aircraft.\nThis Air Force One that we're currently flying on is in great shape thanks to the skill and professionalism of the men and women of the United States Air Force. It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life. And this administration has done the important work of ensuring that we are planning ahead so that future Presidents can benefit from a modern presidential aircraft in the same way that this President has benefitted from it.\nI would just point out that the updated Air Force One is not scheduled to come online until 2023. So this is a longer-range plan. But ultimately, the planning work that we have done on behalf of future Presidents is something that the next administration will have to decide whether or not to carry forward.\nQ: Josh, your administration itself, President Obama cancelled the Marine One project when he came into office. How is this really any different from what you all did initially?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that Marine One project is one that was further in development, and it was clear that the expected cost was much greater than originally expected. And that was based on how far the project had advanced at that point. Our country was also in rather historically difficult financial circumstances. And what President Obama did was he basically said that the process of procuring presidential helicopters should be restarted.\nSo it wasn't a situation that President Obama entirely canceled the program. He essentially said the way that it's been working thus far is too expensive, so he asked professionals at the Department of Defense to go back, reinitiate the program, and see if they could get the cost projections under control.\nAnd again, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense about this. The way that the process has been working over the last seven years or so has factored in the significant technical requirements of a new presidential helicopter while also keeping costs under control. And I expect that that effective management of that program will result in a new presidential helicopter that President-elect Trump will be glad that he has.\nWith regard to your other question about The Washington Post report today, let me just quibble a little bit with some of the language in the story and in your question about the report being buried. This is --\nQ: Suppressed.\nMR. EARNEST: Suppressed. Suppressed.\nThis is a report that Defense News wrote an article on back in January of 2015. So it's possible that it's an extraordinary compliment that it is due to the fine men and women who write for Defense News. It also may be an indication that this is a document that was available to other members of the public, including other journalists who carefully cover the Pentagon.\nI'll also point out that, at least as of this morning, the report was available to anybody in the world that had a live Internet connection and a relatively modern Web browser because it was available at the Pentagon website.\nMore generally, I would point out that there are many self-described defense hawks and fiscal conservatives in the United States Congress who are blocking Pentagon-recommended reforms that would strengthen our military and save taxpayers billions of dollars. That's the real scandal. That's worthy of front-page treatment on The Washington Post.\nAnd when you consider the recommendations that this administration has put forward, including urging for years to Congress to re-initiate a BRAC process that would save taxpayers billions of dollars -- right now the Pentagon estimates that there's 22 percent more infrastructure than the Pentagon actually needs to keep us safe. The administration has long encouraged the phase-out of A-10 military aircraft that are in the process of being replaced by more modern equipment. The administration has encouraged slowing down the production of the littoral combat ship until more upgrades can come online. That will save taxpayers significant sums of money in maintenance costs in future years.\nI could give you some additional examples, but I'll stop there. All of this is an indication that there are proposals that this administration has forwarded to Congress for years, included in our budget, that would strengthen our national defense and save taxpayers billions that are ignored by Congress, ignored by Republicans in Congress who claim to care about our national security and who claim to want to reduce government spending. It's scandalous and worthy of careful consideration.\nQ: Chancellor Merkel endorsed a ban of a full-veil burqa today. You guys have talked before in the past about upholding certain liberal traditions. What reaction do you have to what Chancellor Merkel said?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen the news of the announcement, but I haven't seen the details of what she said about it or how she described her thinking. What I'll just say is, here in the United States we obviously go to great lengths to protect the constitutional rights of every American to worship God in the manner that they choose. In fact, this country was founded by people who came to the United States seeking a country where they could worship God in the manner that they chose without interference from the government.\nSo this is a value that President Obama feels quite strongly about. This is a value of religious freedom that I think the vast majority of Americans feel quite strongly about. But I can't speak to the specific decision that was made by Chancellor Merkel today.\nAnybody else? We'll see you on the ground, guys. Thank you.\nEND 12:58 P.M.

Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, thank you so much. Good afternoon, everybody.\nAudience members. Good afternoon.\nThe President. I was just told that was going to be the last \"Hail to the Chief\" on the road, and it got me kind of sentimental. I want to, first and foremost, say thanks to all of you. Just before I came here, I was able to visit with some of the men and women from MacDill Air Force Base, Central Command, our Special Operations Command to thank them for their extraordinary service. And so to you and your families and to the extended family of American servicemembers, let me say that our Nation owes you an unbelievable debt of gratitude. We are grateful for you, and we will be praying for you over the holidays. So—[applause].\nAs you know all too well, your mission—and the course of history—was changed after the 9/11 attacks. By the time I took office, the United States had been at war for 7 years. For 8 years that I've been in office, there has not been a day when a terrorist organization or some radicalized individual was not plotting to kill Americans. And on January 20, I will become the first President of the United States to serve two full terms during a time of war. Now, we did not choose this fight, but once it came to us, the world saw the measure of our resolve.\nThe most solemn responsibility for any President is keeping the American people safe. In carrying out that duty, I have sent men and women into harm's way. I've visited troops around the globe. I have met our wounded warriors, and I've grieved with Gold Star families. I know better than most that it is because of your service and your sacrifice that we have been able, during these 8 years, to protect our homeland, to strike crippling blows against terrorist networks, and fortify our friends and our allies. So today I'd like to reflect on that work and talk about the foundation that we will leave for the next administration.\nI came to this office with a set of core convictions that have guided me as Commander in Chief. I believe that the United States military can achieve any mission; that we are, and must remain, the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. I believe that we must never hesitate to act when necessary, including unilaterally when necessary, against any imminent threats to our people. But I've also insisted that it is unwise and unsustainable to ask our military to build nations on the other side of the world or resolve their internal conflicts, particularly in places where our forces become a magnet for terrorists and insurgencies. Instead, it's been my conviction that even as we focus relentlessly on dismantling terrorist networks like Al Qaida and ISIL, we should ask allies to do their share in the fight, and we should strengthen local partners who can provide lasting security.\nAnd these convictions guided the policies we pursued both in Iraq and Afghanistan. When I took office, the United States was focused overwhelmingly on Iraq, where nearly 150,000 American troops had spent years fighting an insurgency and helping to build a democratic government. Meanwhile, Al Qaida had regrouped in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan and was actively planning attacks against our homeland. So we brought nearly 150,000 troops home from Iraq, consistent with the status of forces agreement negotiated by the previous administration, and we surged our efforts along with our allies in Afghanistan, which allowed us to focus on dismantling Al Qaida and give the Afghan Government the opportunity to succeed.\nAnd this focus on Al Qaida—the most dangerous threat to the United States at the time—paid dividends. Today, by any measure, core Al Qaida—the organization that hit us on 9/11—is a shadow of its former self. Plots directed from within Afghanistan and Pakistan have been consistently disrupted. Its leadership has been decimated. Dozens of terrorist leaders have been killed. Usama bin Laden is dead. And importantly, we have built a counterterrorism capability that can sustain this pressure against any terrorist network in South Asia that might threaten the United States of America. That was because of the work of our outstanding servicemembers.\nMoreover, that early decision to strengthen our efforts in Afghanistan allowed us to build the capacity of Afghans to secure and defend their own country. So today, there are less than 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan. Instead of being in the lead against the Taliban, Americans are now supporting 320,000 Afghan security forces who are defending their communities and supporting our counterterrorism efforts.\nNow, I don't want to paint too rosy a picture. The situation in Afghanistan is still tough. War has been a part of life in Afghanistan for over 30 years, and the United States cannot eliminate the Taliban or end violence in that country. But what we can do is deny Al Qaida a safe haven, and what we can do is support Afghans who want a better future, which is why we have worked not only with their military, but we've backed a unity Government in Kabul. We've helped Afghan girls go to school. We've supported investments in health care and electricity and education. You have made a difference in Afghanistan, and America is safer for it.\nOf course, the terrorist threat was never restricted to South Asia or to Afghanistan or Pakistan. Even as Al Qaida has been decimated in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the threat from terrorists metastasized in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. And most dangerously, we saw the emergence of ISIL, the successor to Al Qaida in Iraq, which fights as both a terrorist network and an insurgency.\nThere's been a debate about ISIL that's focused on whether a continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq back in 2011 could have stopped the threat of ISIL from growing. And as a practical matter, this was not an option. By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq.\nIn addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL's rise: a government in Baghdad that pursued a sectarian agenda, a brutal dictator in Syria who lost control of large parts of the country, social media that reached a global pool of recruits, and a hollowing out of Iraq's security forces, which were ultimately overrun in Mosul in 2014. In fact, American troops, had they stayed there, would have lacked legal protections and faced a choice between remaining on bases or being drawn back into a sectarian conflict against the will of Iraq's elected Government or Iraq's local populations.\nBut circumstances changed. When ISIL made substantial gains in—first in Mosul and then in other parts of the country, then suddenly, Iraqis reached out once again for help. And in shaping our response, we refused to repeat some of the mistakes of the 2003 invasion that have helped to give rise to the organization that became ISIL in the first place.\nWe conditioned our help on the emergence of a new Iraqi Government and Prime Minister that was committed to national unity and committed to working with us. We built an international coalition of nearly 70 nations, including some of Iraq's neighbors. We surged our intelligence resources so that we could better understand the enemy. And then, we took the fight to ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, not with American battalions, but with local forces backed by our equipment and our advisers and, importantly, our special forces. In that campaign, we have now hit ISIL with over 16,000 airstrikes. We have equipped and trained tens of thousands of partners on the ground.\nAnd today, the results are clear: ISIL has lost more than half its territory; ISIL has lost control of major population centers; its morale is plummeting, its recruitment is drying up, its commanders and external plotters are being taken out, and local populations are turning against it.\nAs we speak, ISIL faces an offensive on Mosul from Iraqi troops and coalition support. That's the largest remaining city that it controls. Meanwhile, in Syria, ISIL's self-declared capital in Raqqa is being squeezed. We've attacked ISIL's financial lifeline, destroying hundreds of millions of dollars of oil and cash reserves. The bottom line is, we are breaking the back of ISIL. We're taking away its safe havens. And we've accomplished all this at a cost of $10 billion over 10—over 2 years, which is the same amount that we used to spend in 1 month at the height of the Iraq war.\nSo the campaign against ISIL has been relentless. It has been sustainable. It has been multilateral. And it demonstrates a shift in how we've taken the fight to terrorists everywhere from South Asia to the Sahel. Instead of pushing all of the burden onto American ground troops, instead of trying to mount invasions wherever terrorists appear, we've built a network of partners: in Libya, where U.S. airpower has helped local militias dislodge a dangerous ISIL cell; in Mali, where U.S. logistics and intelligence support helped our French allies roll back Al Qaida branches there; in Somalia, where U.S. operations support an African Union-led force and international peacekeepers; and in Yemen, where years of targeted strikes have degraded Al Qaida in the Peninsula.\nAnd these offensive efforts have buttressed a global effort to make it harder for terrorist networks to breach our defenses and spread their violent ideologies. Working with European allies who have suffered terrible attacks, we've strengthened intelligence sharing and cut in half the flow of foreign fighters to ISIL. We've worked with our tech sector to support efforts to push back on terrorist messages on social media that motivate people to kill. A recent study shows that ISIL's propaganda has been cut in half. We've launched a Global Engagement Center to empower voices that are countering ISIL's perversion of Islam, and we're working closely with Muslim-majority partners from the Gulf to Southeast Asia.\nThis is your work. We should take great pride in the progress that we've made over the last 8 years. That's the bottom line.\nNo foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland. And it's not because they didn't try. Plots have been disrupted. Terrorists have been taken off the battlefield. And we've done this even as we drew down nearly 180,000 troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, there are just 15,000. New partnerships have been built. We've respected the rule of law. We've enlisted our values in this fight. And all of this progress is due to the service of millions of Americans like you: in intelligence and in law enforcement, in homeland security, in diplomacy, in the Armed Services of the United States of America. It's thanks to you. [Applause] Thanks to you.\nNow, to say that we've made progress is not to say that the job is done. We know that a deadly threat persists. We know that in some form this violent extremism will be with us for years to come. In too many parts of the world, especially in the Middle East, there has been a breakdown of order that's been building for decades, and it's unleashed forces that are going to take a generation to resolve. Long-term corruption has rotted too many nation-states from within. Governance is collapsing. Sectarian conflicts rage. A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water. And false prophets are peddling a vision of Islam that is irreconcilable with tolerance and modernity and basic science. And in fact, every one of these trends is at play inside of Syria today.\nAnd what complicates the challenge even more is the fact that for all of our necessary focus on fighting terrorists overseas, the most deadly attacks on the homeland over the last 8 years have not been carried out by operatives with sophisticated networks or equipment, directed from abroad. They've been carried out by homegrown and largely isolated individuals who were radicalized online.\nThese deranged killers can't inflict the sort of mass casualties that we saw on 9/11, but the pain of those who lost loved ones in Boston, in San Bernardino, in Fort Hood, and Orlando, that pain continues to this day. And in some cases, it has stirred fear in our populations and threatens to change how we think about ourselves and our lives.\nSo while we've made it much more difficult—you have made it much more difficult—to carry out an attack approaching the scale of 9/11, the threat will endure. We will not achieve the kind of clearly defined victory comparable to those that we won in previous wars against nations. We won't have a scene of the Emperor of Japan and Douglas MacArthur in a surrender. And the reason we won't have that is because technology makes it impossible to completely shield impressionable minds from violent ideologies. And somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it's very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon.\nSo rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world, we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat, and we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained.\nIn the time remaining, let me suggest what I think should guide this approach. First of all, a sustainable counterterrorism strategy depends on keeping the threat in perspective. The terrorist threat is real, and it is dangerous. But these terrorists want to cast themselves as the vanguard of a new world order. They are not. They are thugs, and they are murderers, and they should be treated that way. Now, fascism threatened to overrun the entire world, and we had to wage total war in response. Communism threatened not over to—only to overturn a world order, but threatened nuclear holocaust, so we had to build armaments and alliances to contain it. Today's terrorists can kill innocent people, but they don't pose an existential threat to our Nation, and we must not make the mistake of elevating them as if they do. That does their job for them. It makes them more important and helps them with recruitment. A second and related point is that we cannot follow the path of previous great powers who sometimes defeated themselves through overreach. By protecting our homeland while drawing down the number of troops serving in harm's way overseas, we helped save resources, but more importantly, we saved lives. I can tell you, during the course of my 8 years, that I have never shied away from sending men and women into danger where necessary. It's always the hardest decision I make, but it's one that I've made where the security of the American people is at stake. And I have seen the cost. I have held the hands of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I have met the caskets of the fallen at Dover. And that's why I make no apologies for only sending our troops into harm's way when there is a clear mission that is achievable and when it is absolutely necessary.\nNumber three, we need the wisdom to see that upholding our values and adhering to the rule of law is not a weakness; in the long term, it is our greatest strength. The whole objective of these terrorists is to scare us into changing the nature of who we are and our democracy. And the fact is, people and nations do not make good decisions when they are driven by fear. These terrorists can never directly destroy our way of life, but we can do it for them if we lose track of who we are and the values that this Nation was founded upon.\nAnd I always remind myself that as Commander in Chief, I must protect our people, but I also swore an oath to defend our Constitution. And over these last 8 years, we have demonstrated that staying true to our traditions as a nation of laws advances our security as well as our values.\nWe prohibited torture, everywhere, at all times, and that includes tactics like waterboarding. And at no time has anybody who has worked with me told me that doing so has cost us good intelligence. When we do capture terrorists, despite all the political rhetoric about the need to strip terrorists of their rights, our interrogation teams have obtained valuable information from terrorists without resorting to torture, without operating outside the law. Our Article III courts have delivered justice faster than military trials. And our prisons have proven more than capable of holding the most dangerous terrorists.\nConsider the terrorists who have been captured, lawfully interrogated, and prosecuted in civilian courts: Faisal Shahzad, who tried to set off a car bomb in Times Square; Dzohkar Tsarneyev, the Boston Marathon bomber; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called underwear bomber. American juries and judges have determined that none of these people will know freedom again. But we did it lawfully. And the wheels of justice right now are turning for others: terrorists like Ahmed Warsame, an al-Shabaab commander, and Abu Khatalla, accused leader of the Benghazi attacks. We can get these terrorists and stay true to who we are.\nAnd in fact, our success in dealing with terrorists through our justice system reinforces why it is past time to shut down the detention facility at Guantanamo. This is not just my opinion, it's the opinion of many military leaders. During my administration, we have responsibly transferred over 175 detainees to foreign governments, with safeguards to reduce the risk of them returning to the battlefield. And we've cut the population in Gitmo from 242 to 59. The politics of fear has led Congress to prevent any detainees from being transferred to prisons in the United States, even though, as we speak, we imprison dangerous terrorists in our prisons, and we have even more dangerous criminals in all of our prisons across the country; even though our allies oftentimes will not turn over a terrorist if they think that terrorist could end up in Gitmo; even though groups like ISIL use Gitmo in their propaganda. So we're wasting hundreds of millions of dollars to keep fewer than 60 people in a detention facility in Cuba. That's not strength. Until Congress changes course, it will be judged harshly by history, and I will continue to do all that I can to remove this blot on our national honor.\nNumber four, we have to fight terrorists in a way that does not create more terrorists. For example, in a dangerous world, terrorists seek out places where it's often impossible to capture them or to count on local governments to do so. And that means the best option for us to get those terrorists becomes a targeted strike. So we have taken action under my command, including with drones, to remove terrorists from the battlefield, which protects our troops and has prevented real threats to the American people.\nNow, under rules that I put in place and that I made public, before any strike is taken outside of a war zone, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured. And while nothing is certain in any strike, and we have acknowledged that there are tragic instances where innocents have been killed by our strikes, this is the highest standard that we can set. Nevertheless, we still have critics who suggest that these strikes are wrong. And I say to them, you have to weigh the alternatives. Drone strikes allow us to deny terrorists a safe haven without airstrikes, which are less precise, or invasions that are much more likely to kill innocent civilians as well as American servicemembers.\nSo the actions that we've taken have saved lives at home and abroad. But the point is, is that we do have to be careful to make sure that when we take actions, we're not alienating local populations, because that will serve as recruitment for new terrorists.\nNumber five, transparency and accountability serve our national security not just in times of peace, but more importantly, in times of conflict. And that's why we've made public information about which terrorist organizations we're fighting and why we're fighting them. We've released assessments of noncombatants killed in our operations, taken responsibility when mistakes are made. We've declassified information about interrogation methods that were wrong so we learn from past mistakes. And yesterday I directed our Government for the first time to release a full description of the legal and policy frameworks that guide our military operations around the world.\nThis public information allows for a more informed public debate, and it provides a potential check on unfettered executive power. The power of the Presidency is awesome, but it is supposed to be bound by you, our citizens. But here's the thing: That information doesn't mean anything—it doesn't work—if the people's representatives in Congress don't do their jobs, if they're not paying attention.\nRight now we are waging war under authorities provided by Congress over 15 years ago—15 years ago. I had no gray hair 15 years ago. [Laughter] Two years ago, I asked Congress, let's update the authorization, provide us a new authorization for the war against ISIL, reflecting the changing nature of the threats, reflecting the lessons that we've learned from the last decade. So far, Congress has refused to take a vote.\nDemocracies should not operate in a state of permanently authorized war. That's not good for our military; it's not good for our democracy. And by the way, part of the reason that's dangerous is because today, with our outstanding, All-Volunteer Force, only 1 percent of the population is actually fighting, which means that you are carrying the burden; which means that it is important for us to know what it is that we're doing and have to explain what we are doing to the public, because it becomes too easy to just send 1 percent of the population out to do things even if they're not well thought through. If a threat is serious enough to require the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, then Members of Congress should at least have the courage to make clear where they stand: not on the sidelines, not on cable TV shows, but by fulfilling their constitutional duty and authorizing the use of force against the threats that we face today. That's how democracies are supposed to work.\nNumber six, alongside our outstanding military work, we have to draw upon the strength of our diplomacy. Terrorists would love to see us walk away from the type of work that builds international coalitions and ends conflicts and stops the spread of deadly weapons. It would make life easier for them; it would be a tragic mistake for us.\nJust think about what we've done these last 8 years without firing a shot. We've rolled back Iran's nuclear program. That's not just my assessment, that's the assessment of Israeli intelligence, even though they were opposed to the deal. We've secured nuclear materials around the globe, reducing the risk that they fall into the hands of terrorists. We've eliminated Syria's declared chemical weapons program. All of these steps have helped keep us safe and helped keep our troops safe. Those are the result of diplomacy. And sustained diplomatic efforts, no matter how frustrating or difficult they sometimes appear, are going to be required to resolve the conflicts roiling in the Middle East, from Yemen to Syria to Israel and Palestine. And if we don't have strong efforts there, the more you will be called upon to clean up after the failure of diplomacy.\nSimilarly, any long-term strategy to reduce the threat of terrorism depends on investments that strengthen some of these fragile societies. Our generals, our commanders understand this. This is not charity. It's fundamental to our national security. A dollar spent on development is worth a lot more than a dollar spent fighting a war.\nThis is how we prevent conflicts from starting in the first place. This is how we can ensure that peace is lasting, after we've fought. It's how we stop people from falling prey to extremism, because children are going to school, and they can think for themselves, and families can feed themselves and aren't desperate, and communities are not ravaged by diseases, and countries are not devastated by climate changes.\nAs Americans, we have to see the value of empowering civil societies so that there are outlets for people's frustrations, and we have to support entrepreneurs who want to build businesses instead of destroying. We have to invest in young people because the areas that are generating terrorists are typically having a huge youth bulge, what makes—which makes them more dangerous. And there are times where we need to help refugees who have escaped the horrors of war in search of a better life. Our military recognizes that these issues of governance and human dignity and development are vital to our security. It's central to our plans in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Let's make sure that this wisdom is reflected in our budgets as well.\nAnd finally, in this fight, we have to uphold the civil liberties that define us. Terrorists want us to turn on one another. And while defeating them requires us to draw upon the enormous capabilities of all of our Government, we have to make sure changes in how we address terrorists are not abused. This is why, for example, we've made extensive reforms in how we gather intelligence around the world, increasing oversight, placing new restrictions on the Government's ability to retain and search and use certain communications so that people trust us, and that way, they cooperate and work with us.\nWe don't use our power to indiscriminately read e-mails or listen to phone calls, just targeted at folks who might be trying to do us harm. We use it to save lives. And by doing so, by maintaining these civil liberties, we sustain the confidence of the American people and we get the cooperation of our allies more readily. Protecting liberty, that's something we do for all Americans and not just some.\nWe are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims, including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America's military.\nIf we stigmatize good, patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists' narrative. It fuels the same false grievances that they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we're not just going to lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we'll also lose sight of the very principles we claim to defend.\nSo let my final words to you as your Commander in Chief be a reminder of what it is that you're fighting for, what it is that we are fighting for. The United States of America is not a country that imposes religious tests as a price for freedom. We're a country that was founded so that people could practice their faiths as they choose. The United States of America is not a place where some citizens have to withstand greater scrutiny or carry a special ID card or prove that they're not an enemy from within. We're a country that has bled and struggled and sacrificed against that kind of discrimination and arbitrary rule, here in our own country and around the world.\nWe're a nation that believes freedom can never be taken for granted and that each of us has a responsibility to sustain it. The universal right to speak your mind and to protest against authority; to live in a society that's open and free, that can criticize a President without retribution; a country where you're judged by the content of your character rather than what you look like or how you worship or what your last name is or where your family came from—that's what separates us from tyrants and terrorists.\nWe are a nation that stands for the rule of law and strengthened the laws of war. When the Nazis were defeated, we put them on trial. Some couldn't understand that; it had never happened before. But as one of the American lawyers who was at Nuremberg says, \"I was trying to prove that the rule of law should govern human behavior.\" And by doing so, we broadened the scope and reach of justice around the world. We held ourselves out as a beacon and an example for others.\nWe are a nation that won World Wars without grabbing the resources of those we defeated. We helped them rebuild. We didn't hold on to territory, other than the cemeteries where we buried our dead. Our Greatest Generation fought and bled and died to build an international order of laws and institutions that could preserve the peace and extend prosperity and promote cooperation among nations. And for all of its imperfections, we depend on that international order to protect our own freedom.\nIn other words, we are a nation that at our best has been defined by hope, and not fear. A country that went through the crucible of a Civil War to offer a new birth of freedom; that stormed the beaches of Normandy, climbed the hills of Iwo Jima; that saw ordinary people mobilize to extend the meaning of civil rights. That's who we are. That's what makes us stronger than any act of terror.\nRemember that history. Remember what that flag stands for. For we depend on you—the heirs to that legacy, our men and women in uniform—and the citizens who support you to carry forward what is best in us: that commitment to a common creed; the confidence that right makes might, not the other way around. That's how we can sustain this long struggle. That's how we'll protect this country. That's how we'll protect our Constitution against all threats, foreign and domestic.\nI trust that you will fulfill that mission, as you have fulfilled all others. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Commander in Chief. I thank you for all that you've done and all that you will do in the future. May God bless you. May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-12-06", "title": "Remarks on United States Counterterrorism Strategy at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida"}

I have full confidence that Gov. Branstad will help forge a strong U.S.–China relationship that is based on the principles of fairness, respect and, most importantly, the rule of law.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119844", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:24 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Very calm in here. Let's see if we can keep it that way. (Laughter.)\nJosh, no pressure, but you'll go first.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to start with a statement that President Obama and some of the Western leaders released this morning on Syria and the crisis in Aleppo. And I was wondering if that statement was intended to signal support specifically for this five-day ceasefire that a number of Syrian rebel factions are calling for, or if the leaders were just referring more generally to the crisis and trying to call attention to it.\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, my understanding is they're not seeking to show support for any one specific plan. There are a variety of proposals that have been put forward that would reduce the violence sufficiently to allow innocent Syrians in Aleppo to get out of harm's way, and for the consistent flow of humanitarian aid to commence, particularly to those regions of the country and to those areas of the city that have been under siege for a long time.\nSo as you'd expect, Josh, these kinds of statements take some time to be negotiated through diplomatic channels, and so this isn't in response to one specific proposal that's been put forward, but rather demonstrating clear, unified international support for some kind of diplomatic arrangement that reduces the violence and allows the flow of humanitarian assistance to commence in a sustained way.\nQ: And the statement was very critical, even condemning, of Russia for its role in facilitating the continuation of violence through its actions at the U.N. and elsewhere. And I'm wondering, given the fact that the U.S. is still talking with Russia about this -- I believe Secretary of State Kerry is meeting Lavrov even today in Germany -- what is the utility of continuing to try to work with Russia on that when we're, in the same breath, saying you guys are the problem, you're the reason that there is not progress on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I think the strategy is essentially to apply pressure to Russia because of the tactics that they have been willing to not just condone but, in some cases, actively support that have resulted in significant innocent loss of life. And it's continuing.\nAnd the President does not believe it's an effective strategy to gloss over or somehow obscure Russia's complicity in this sordid affair in order to reach a solution. In fact, we actually believe that Russia bears special responsibility to help bring about a diplomatic solution because of the way that it intervened on behalf of the Assad regime and because of their own stated significant national interest in the outcome of the situation inside of Syria.\nSo we're not going to advance a diplomatic solution by somehow acting like Russia has been a good actor when they haven't, or pretending that Russia somehow doesn't have a stake in the outcome when the truth is they've got as big a stake in the outcome as any other country outside of Syria. So it's time for them to play a responsible role. And thus far, they haven't. And that's isolated them in the international community. It's what makes them the object of so much criticism and even scorn from the international community because of their willingness to support actively the depraved tactics of the Assad regime to try to bomb innocent civilians into submission.\nQ: Philippine President Duterte has given out a readout of his recent conversation with President-elect Trump and he says that Trump said basically, don't worry about U.S. concerns about your fight against drug criminals; go ahead, you're doing a good job. How alarming is that to the U.S., given that what we're essentially talking about -- or what you've talked about from that podium is the killing of thousands of people without any kind of due process?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I have no special knowledge of the telephone conversation between the President-elect and the President of the Philippine, so I can't be in a position to critique the view that's being expressed by the President-elect to the President of the Philippines.\nWhat I can do, however, is restate the position of this administration, the position of the current U.S. government, and that is simply that extrajudicial killings are entirely inconsistent with the notion of the rule of law and a commitment to upholding basic, universal human rights. It's plain and simple.\nThere is a significant challenge facing the government of the Philippines to combat the drug trade in their country. And it raises significant questions about their economy and about the security situation in the Philippines. That is a legitimate problem that's worth confronting. And, in fact, the United States has been supportive of previous efforts by the Philippines to confront the drug trade and try to limit, if not eradicate it.\nBut President Duterte has certainly raised concerns about the degree to which his government is at least willing to look the other way while these kinds of extrajudicial killings are taking place and while vigilante justice is being meted out. That's not going to solve the problem.\nThe President gave a long speech about this yesterday, about how it's important that our efforts to advance the interests of the United States and provide for the security of the United States is enhanced when we do it consistent with our values. That same principle applies to other countries, as well.\nThe other principle that I think is at stake here is a little higher-level principle, but it's an important one nonetheless. One of the reasons that it's important for us to invest in the durability and strength of our alliances is so that we can acknowledge publicly when we disagree. It's the sign of a strong relationship that we can acknowledge differences of opinion and encourage our closest friends around the world to live up to the values that our countries and our people prioritize. It's a sign of weakness in a relationship if you can't acknowledge differences of opinion.\nThat's true in interpersonal matters; it's also true in international diplomacy. And we don't agree with our allies on every issue. And preserving the strength of those alliances and investing in the strength of those alliances allows us to, where appropriate, air those differences and not shy away from them. And in this case, it's important because the United States draws upon our adherence to these values because it contributes to our influence around the world. Countries want to be allied with the United States because they recognize what it is that we stand for. And when we stay true to those values, it only enhances our influence around the globe. That makes us safer.\nAnd signaling a willingness to backtrack from those values is bad for our individual relationships, but it's also bad for -- degrades our ability to exert our influence around the world.\nQ: And lastly, is the White House amenable to adding a provision in the short-term spending bill to essentially fast-track a waiver for General Mattis, given that the President is going to have to sign this bill to keep the government funded?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a couple of principles at play here, Josh. The first is that President Obama has long made the argument that while the Senate does have some responsibility to confirm the President's nominees -- to offer that advice and consent is a fundamental responsibility of the Senate -- at the same time, the President of the United States should be given a lot -- significant latitude to assemble his team.\nIn many instances, that courtesy was not extended to this President by Republicans in the Senate. But the President believes that's an important principle. And again, that is a principle that can be faithfully observed without eroding the constitutional responsibility of the United States Senate to offer their advice and consent.\nSecond, when it comes to General Mattis, we're talking about somebody that President Obama knows. General Mattis served as the commander of Central Command for two or three years while President Obama was in office. He is somebody who served his country with distinction. He's a decorated Marine Corps veteran. But President Obama believes that -- well, the standard that we have tried to set is to not comment on, pass judgment on the individuals that the President-elect has put forward to serve in his Cabinet. And I'm going to try to abide by that principle here.\nQ: This isn't really about General Mattis and his own views on issues or anything. It's about the fact that he's a general, and that in order for him to be confirmed there would have to be a waiver passed by Congress to permit that. So it's kind of a different principle.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, well, I think all these principles come into play, though. And I certainly wouldn't want any sort of commentary about this matter to be construed as some sort of implicit criticism of General Mattis -- for a variety of reasons, including he's somebody who has served this country with distinction under Democratic and Republican Presidents, and he's supported, based on the public comments I've seen, by both Democrats and Republicans that he's interacted with in the context of his job.\nWhat I will say seems odd is that Senate Republicans feel the need to tuck this provision into a budget bill in order to advance it, instead of having this question of a waiver be considered on its merits. So the kind of tactics and legislative strategy, to the extent there is one, that has regularly been applied by senators in the Congress is one that I've been mystified by in the past, so this is not exactly an unprecedented kind of situation.\nBut, in general, what I can say is that President Obama believes in the principle of the President being able to assemble a team. He certainly believes in the principle that somebody like General Mattis is a decorated Marine, has demonstrated his patriotism and service to the country, has served this country with distinction, but ultimately the President-elect and the next Congress are going to have to determine how exactly to advance his nomination to the Senate.\nAyesha.\nQ: More on appointments. Today, President-elect Trump told the \"Today Show\" that he has consulted President Obama about some of his appointments and that he takes the President's recommendations very seriously, and also that I guess at least one of the appointments or some of the appointments were highly -- or were liked by President Obama, according to President-elect Trump. So I just wondered -- I know that you have declined to kind of talk about what the President thinks of all the appointments, but I guess what type of advice is the President giving to President-elect Trump? Trump talked about it today. So what type of advice is he giving him as he appoints his Cabinet? And also can you speak even about this kind of burgeoning relationship? I mean, at this point, Trump has repeatedly said that he likes President Obama and he thinks President Obama likes him, too. So can you talk about this relationship? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: This would probably make for an interesting episode of \"Dr. Phil.\" (Laughter.) Not that I'm giving them any programming ideas -- but they can take that one and run with it.\nLook, I know that the President-elect had an opportunity when he was asked in an interview to talk a little bit about his consultations with President Obama. And he's the President-elect of the United States, and he's on the other end of the phone when the President is talking, so he's got a little more latitude to do that than I do. I'm going to, from here, in my role, going to protect the ability of the President of the United States to consult in private with the President-elect.\nI've, on a number of occasions, confirmed that there have been at least a handful of conversations between the President and the President-elect, in addition to the Oval Office meeting that all of you observed, something that took place 36 hours after the votes were tallied on Election Day. And after that meeting, the President-elect told all of you that it was his expectation the he would consult frequently with the President of the United States because he believed it would be helpful to him. And since that time, we've made clear that President Obama was not just a willing participant in those kinds of conversations but that he would welcome the opportunity to be as helpful as he possibly could to the incoming President.\nAnd that's what he has tried to do. That's what we have tried to do as an administration in terms of ensuring a smooth and effective transition to the next administration. But for the content of the conversations that are occurring between the two men, that's not something that I'm going to speak about from here.\nQ: So there's no -- like you couldn't talk about maybe an overarching kind of guidance that he's trying to give him when it comes to the Cabinet?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the way that I would describe it is consultation, and the President is responsive to requests and phone calls from the President-elect. But beyond that, I just don't have any additional insight that I can share about the nature of the telephone conversations.\nQ: Going back to Aleppo, I just want to be clear. Does the administration have a position on what the rebels should do? Should they withdraw from Aleppo? I guess Syria and Russia have called for that, said they will not consider a ceasefire until the rebels leave Aleppo. Does the U.S. have a position on that?\nMR. EARNEST: The U.S. position is that the United Nations is working tirelessly to try to broker the kind of ceasefire in Aleppo that would allow for the significant flow of badly needed humanitarian assistance. The opposition has agreed to the U.N. plan. And we believe that the Syrians should, too. We believe that the Russians should use their influence with the Assad regime to get them to agree to that plan.\nBut whether it's the U.N. plan or some other diplomatic negotiation that results in a reduction of violence and an increase in humanitarian assistance, that's what we're after. And the chief obstacle to that goal has been the depraved military tactics of the Assad regime and the complicity of the Russians and Iranians. And that's the position that we're trying to get them to change. And it's a position that, thus far, has resulted in widespread bloodshed and a genuine human tragedy inside of Syria. And the longer that the Syrian government and the Russians and Iranians resist this potential solution, the more conflict and more violence and more bloodshed and more tragedy will occur.\nMichelle.\nQ: Just to clear up some of these things that have been said on both sides of these phone calls between the President and President-elect -- does the President enjoy these phone calls?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is pleased that he can play a role in ensuring a smooth and effective transition. And that's something that he has identified as a very high priority, particularly for his last several weeks in office here. So he's certainly pleased that he can offer advice and assistance that may be useful to the incoming administration.\nQ: And now that President-elect Trump has been pretty detailed in his description and he, just today, as Ayesha was saying, he said that he really does like -- that he loves getting his ideas. Can it at least be said -- does the President like Donald Trump? Does he like talking to him as a person?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, for the President's personal feelings you should just talk to the President about that. And it's important that -- we'll do another news conference here and maybe somebody will choose to ask. But I can't speak to their personal relationship.\nWhat I can speak to is the President's ongoing commitment to coordinating effectively with the President-elect's team and the President-elect personally to ensure a smooth and effective transition. And that's included not just in the Oval Office meeting 36 hours after the votes were tallied, but it's also included additional telephone calls between the two men and a variety of meetings at a variety of levels at agencies all across the federal government to give the incoming administration the best opportunity to get off to a running start.\nQ: Since the last time we asked you about these phone calls -- and you mentioned that there had been a handful -- have there been any more between then and now?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't remember exactly the last time that I was asked, so I can't confirm any additional calls at this point.\nQ: One thing you have spoken to a number of times both before and after the election are what you call the deep concerns that the President has going forward with this new administration. So is it safe to say that the President still has concerns about some of the picks that Trump has made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a -- we're not going to take a position on individual nominees that are put forward by the President-elect. I think what those deep concerns often referred to were some of the rhetoric and policy positions that were advocated by Mr. Trump when he was running for President. But elections have consequences. And while those concerns have not gone away, the election is over, and the institutional responsibility of the President and everybody who works for him is to focus on putting our political differences and our political opinions aside and fulfilling the duties that the American people have entrusted us with, which is to serve the public and to give the choice of the American voters the opportunity to succeed in the years ahead.\nQ: So the numerous concerns that both the President and you listed haven't been assuaged at all by anything you've seen since the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think it's too early to judge. And people all across the country will have the opportunity to do exactly that. And, look, President-elect Trump ran for office advocating a much different approach to running the country than the one that President Obama has pursued over the last eight years. He said he wanted to do things differently and he found a variety of very colorful ways to make that quite clear to everybody who was walking into the voting booth. And the outcome of the election is such that Secretary Clinton got 2.5 million more votes, but President-elect Trump won the election. He won the Electoral College. He will be the next President of the United States. And the American people will have an opportunity to see whether or not the different kind of approach that he's advocating actually yields better results.\nSo we certainly want people to understand exactly what kind of progress this country was able to make under the leadership of President Obama, to persuade them of the wisdom of that approach so that they'll be able to evaluate it against the kind of changed approach that President-elect Trump is vowing to pursue.\nQ: Over the last couple of days we've heard some pretty heavy criticism of certain of Donald Trump's picks. And I know you don't want to get into individual assessments or anything, and I'm not asking for that. But when you talk about concerns that are still there, do those include the people that he's choosing to be around him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't want to signal a position one way or the other on some of --on any of the President-elect's personnel decisions. I think the obvious thing that I would be willing to say is that President-elect Trump is choosing people with different views and different styles than the kinds of people that President Obama chose.\nAnd the American people were very well served by the service of people like Secretary Burwell, who has effectively implemented the Affordable Care Act; or Secretary McDonald, who has implemented a series of reforms and reduced the backlog at the VA, and expanded and improved the delivery of benefits being provided to our veterans; or there are people like Secretary Carter, who has undertaken significant efforts to strengthen our military and making sure that we're making smart planning decisions so that the future of the U.S. military is effectively adapted to the challenges that we may face moving forward.\nSo, look, I could cite examples all across the administration, not just at the Cabinet level, but also at the White House. The kinds of people that President-elect Trump has chosen appear to have, in many cases, different priorities, different styles and, in some cases, starkly different bank accounts. (Laughter.) But the President-elect should benefit from the latitude -- significant latitude to choose his team.\nQ: -- a little contrast there?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I think I am. (Laughter.) I do think that over -- look, at the end of eight years, we will have a variety of benchmarks and metrics to evaluate how the United States of America benefitted from the priorities, agenda, and leadership style of President Obama. And there will be a very clear opportunity for all of you, in particular, to evaluate whether or not the kinds of changes that President-elect Trump puts in place benefit the country. And that's an open question, but it's an experiment that the American people in all their wisdom have chosen to conduct.\nQ: Are you saying their bank account affects someone's capability?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all. I think it -- I don't think it would actually have much of an impact at all on anybody's ability to serve the country.\nQ: Why did you say it then?\nMR. EARNEST: Mostly to be funny. (Laughter.) And it got a couple of chuckles.\nQ: Thanks for spelling that out. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I guess that goes to that old adage, though, if you have to explain the joke, it wasn't that funny. (Laughter.) So maybe it wasn't.\nCheryl.\nQ: Okay, the CR.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: Yes, it came out last night -- April 28th, a lot of riders, but a lot of funding. Will the President sign it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that the President and his team were up late last night -- I don't know if the President was up late last night reviewing the bill, but the President's team, the experts at the OMB and other agencies that are trying to understand the consequences of some of the proposals that are included in the CR have been carefully analyzing that.\nI'm not ready to render a judgment one way or the other on the proposal. But I can tell you that we continue to review the legislation and are looking at the finer points to make sure we understand exactly what impact the passage of the bill would have on funding the U.S. government.\nQ: Do you believe that we can avoid a government shutdown in two days? Is there enough time to pass this CR?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly no expert on legislative procedure and as I've observed on many other occasions, even simple things have posed a significant challenge to this Republican-led Congress, so I'm not making any predictions. I certainly hope we'll be able to avoid a government shutdown. I can't envision a scenario in which the U.S. economy or the American people somehow benefit from a government shutdown. So hopefully that's something we'll be able to avoid.\nWhat it will require is something that it's required the last couple of years, which is compromise. And that is another thing that Republicans in Congress have not demonstrated much of an ability to do. But it will be required in this instance. It's going to require bipartisan compromise for this bill to pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law by a Democratic President. The President is willing to compromise. He doesn't expect that every element of the CR should be something that he wholeheartedly supports. He recognizes that this will be a compromise. But we're taking a look at the bill to understand exactly what sort of compromise will be required, and we'll let you know as soon as we can about the final conclusion that's been reached.\nQ: Do you expect to have a judgment today on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know how much progress they've been able to make on it today, but we'll keep you posted.\nRon.\nQ: Anything on the General Flynn-Ambassador Rice meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything on that. I know that there have been some reports about Ambassador Rice meeting with the individual that the President-elect designated to succeed her in the fancy corner office in the West Wing.\nWhat I can tell you is that, more generally, the National Security Council, under the leadership of Dr. Rice, has spent months preparing materials, assembling briefing books, compiling information to ensure a smooth and effective transition into the next administration. So I'm not in a position to confirm any individual meetings that have taken place, but I can tell you that there have been a variety of meetings that have already occurred that are focused on achieving that goal.\nAnd when we're talking about the National Security Council, we're talking about the organization that is responsible for managing a range of very sensitive issues. So a lot of close coordination and consultation will be required to ensure a smooth handoff here. And we're certainly committed -- and I know that Dr. Rice is personally committed -- to ensuring that we're going to do everything that's required to make that happen.\nQ: The statement on Syria by the six nations, how was that initiated? Was that something that the President initiated? Or who? I'm not sure, you may have answered that. But I --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I'm not aware that there was any individual presidential-level conversation about this. But obviously the President has had a number of conversations with some of the world leaders who signed on to this statement about the situation in Syria.\nQ: I ask because you've always emphasized how the President is trying to use every diplomatic means available to him to effect a more positive situation there. So this doesn't fall into that category?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no -- look, the President has worked assiduously to mobilize the international community to respond to the situation inside of Syria, and there were a number of conversations that President Obama has had with the leaders of these countries who signed on to the statement in a variety of settings. And this has been a long-running effort.\nAnd, look, I think this is a good example of how U.S. leadership is important in the international community and is effective in advancing our interests. It doesn't benefit the United States of America for there to be continued chaos inside of Syria. And President Obama continues to rally the international community both through our counter-ISIL coalition, but also through diplomacy like this to try to find the kind of diplomatic solution that will bring an end to the violence inside of Syria that will expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance, but also make the world safer for the American people.\nQ: In an interview -- in a tease about an interview that the President did on CNN -- I believe it was about ISIS -- he said something to the effect that ISIS's ability to launch a major land offensive \"was not on my radar.\" Have you heard that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think this may be the CNN documentary that's running later today.\nQ: So the statement, again, ISIS's ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar -- does that suggest a huge failure on the part of the administration to see this threat coming?\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe you're making a reference to an event that's not coming to mind here. What are you referring to here?\nQ: The President's statement in this interview where he said, ISIS's ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar.\nMR. EARNEST: So you're talking about in Iraq in 2014?\nQ: Exactly.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. I thought this was a reference to the President's speech yesterday. But now I see what you're trying to talk about.\nLook, I think this may be a situation where let's take a look at the President's -- the entire context of the President's remarks. I think we've talked a lot about how the Iraqi security forces did not perform at a level that we expected them to, even in the face of this threat from ISIL. And that's something that I know that I've talked about from here, and something the President has talked about before. But we'll take a closer look at the President's comments when they air in full tonight.\nQ: He seemed to suggest an intelligence failure -- or admit one -- on the part of the United States -- not necessarily a failure by the Iraqis, a failure on the American side to see this coming.\nLastly, what does the President think of Joe Biden in 2020?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't asked him about it. I think that as the Vice President was answering the question, I think that he -- well, I didn't talk to the Vice President about it either, so --\nQ: You couldn't think of anything funny to say? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not for the first time in my life and certainly not for the first time in the context of this job.\nI'll let the Vice President's comment stand. And if he chooses to further clarify them, then he'll do that himself, or I'll have a conversation with him and see if I can bring some greater clarity.\nMargaret, nice to see you.\nQ: Nice to see you. The President, yesterday in his remarks, talked about Guantanamo -- hundreds of millions' expense to keep 59 guys there, a blot on our national conscience. But he stopped short of saying that he's actually going to shut the place down before he leaves. Was this a final sort of coming to terms with the fact that the prison is going to stay open after he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, we have been deeply dismayed at the obstacles that Congress has erected to prevent progress on this significant national security priority. Democratic and Republican national security experts strongly support the President's position that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would save taxpayer dollars and make the country safer. A variety of military leaders have reached that conclusion. Even President George W. Bush, who has different views on foreign policy than President Obama in most areas, but in this area, he agrees that the prison should be closed.\nSo there's strong bipartisan agreement among those who have dedicated their lives to protecting the country that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed, and the American people would benefit from it.\nBut this is a political situation that members of Congress in both parties, to be fair, have allowed to persist that prevents this kind of common-sense policy from being implemented. That's been deeply disappointing to the President. And we're going to continue to do everything we can between now and the President's departure to reduce the prison population at Gitmo.\nAnd there's a strategy that we have initiated that includes the individual review of these prisoners to determine the wisdom of transferring them overseas. And when this interagency panel determines that an individual, under the right restrictions, can be safely transferred to another country, we're doing the important diplomatic work of finding another country who will take them.\nAnd since President Obama has been in office, there are about 175 Gitmo detainees that have been transferred under these conditions. And that's been good for the country. But Congress has repeatedly thrown up obstacles that prevent the successful closing of the prison.\nQ: That wasn't admitting defeat?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has been deeply disappointed by how Congress has refused to fulfill their basic responsibility to save taxpayer dollars, or at least spend their money judiciously, and enhance the national security of the United States. On both metrics, with regard to this policy, Congress has fallen down on the job. And that's been a source of significant frustration that we've expressed from time to time over the last eight years.\nQ: You talked about some of the national security officials who support closure. One of them who clearly did not is the man who looks to be the new Department of Homeland Security chief, General Kelly, who has argued that Guantanamo is not only operated well, but that it has a place in our national security framework, and prisoners should be there. So is the President disappointed to see that the President-elect is putting someone into this position who is on record saying no one is innocent at Gitmo and that it should stay open?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I want to be real clear about our position about the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay should not be viewed by anybody as an attempt to impugn or criticize the service of our men and women in uniform who are operating that prison. That's difficult work. And so I don't want this policy position to be portrayed by somebody as a criticism of our men and women in uniform.\nWith respect to General Kelly's comments, I'm going to reserve comment on anybody that President-elect Trump has put forward for a senior Cabinet-level position. Obviously, as I alluded to earlier, many of them have positions that are different than positions that this administration has prioritized. And that's not particularly surprising given the outcome of the election. But I don't have a specific reaction to General Kelly's stated position on this issue.\nQ: A question on Syria, to come back to it?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: In the language of the statement you released this morning, you seem to be suggesting something like sanctions. You said \"restrictive measures on entities and individuals are being considered\". You've got sanctions on Russia, sanctions on Iran, sanctions on the Assad regime. These are all punitive. They are clearly not prohibitive. They've done absolutely nothing to stop the violence in Aleppo or in Syria. So is this kind of rhetoric the extent of the action the United States and the world powers are going to take right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the extent of the action that we are taking is, first and foremost, military action against ISIL terrorists and other extremists inside of Syria that are trying to capitalize on the chaos to plot and execute attacks against the United States and the West. And so --\nQ: Well, the statement was about that 200,000 civilians and children are being denied medicine and food. That's what you're statement was about.\nMR. EARNEST: That was what the statement was about. But people should not be confused about the totality of U.S. action to protect the American people and advance our interests around the world, including in Syria. And our actions in Syria have taken ISIL leaders off the battlefield. They've taken other extremists off the battlefield, including extremists who are plotting and planning to carry out attacks against the United States and our allies in the West.\nAnd so there is a lot of focus on the situation in Aleppo, and there should be. In fact, there probably should be more. But we should not allow the tragedy in Aleppo to obscure the important work that's being done by the United States military and our 67 coalition partners to take the fight to ISIL, to increase pressure on extremists, and to enhance the national security of the United States.\nWith regard to Aleppo, our efforts don't just include negotiations among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. They also include supporting a U.N.-led effort to try to facilitate a diplomatic agreement. And they also include extensive repeated discussions with the Russians to try to bring them to the negotiating table so that they use their influence with the Assad regime to get us closer to an agreement. But the Russians have been resistant to doing that. And that's what's allowed this tragedy to continue.\nBut ultimately, the United States is playing a leading role in the international community -- to organize the international community to apply pressure to Russia, Iran and Syria to bring them to the negotiating table. They're going to have to be a part of any negotiated solution. And that's what we're trying to bring about.\nQ: Respectfully, the international community efforts -- five or six U.N. resolutions have been killed so far, all the diplomatic talks have failed. So that's why the question --\nMR. EARNEST: The reason why we're still working on it is because we haven't gotten the results we'd like to see yet.\nQ: But it's just rhetoric, it's just words at this point. And there's an immediate crisis. I mean, Kerry is talking to Lavrov today. He's going to Paris this weekend. But in the meantime, there are people very much in crisis, which is what your statement is about. So is the statement the extent of immediate action?\nMR. EARNEST: No. There's a meeting with Russia that Secretary Kerry is planning later this week. There are continued efforts at the U.N. to apply diplomatic pressure to the situation. There are continued talks that are being led by the U.N. to try to facilitate a diplomatic agreement.\nIf there were an obvious or simple military solution, it's certainly possible that the United States and our allies, or at least our partners in the counter-ISIL coalition, would have considered it by now. But we have said from the beginning, from day one, that the ultimate solution here is a diplomatic one. And diplomacy is hard. And Russia, in particular, has been resistant to engaging constructively in pursuit of that negotiated solution.\nAnd we've been profoundly disappointed by that, and lives have been lost as a result of that. There's no denying that. But it's certainly not for any sort of lack of effort or lack of action on the part of the United States. And we continue to mobilize and lead the international community both to look after the national security interests of the United States but also to try to bring this human tragedy to an end.\nQ: What are the restrictive measures that you're talking about in the statement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a variety of things that have been considered, including the kinds of financial penalties that the United States has been able to apply in coordination with our allies in a variety of situations. And I certainly wouldn't rule out something like that in the future, but I would also acknowledge that we haven't seen those sorts of sanctions bring about the entirety of the change in strategy that we'd like to see.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Is the President aware of the declared mistrial in the case of the South Carolina officer that killed Walter Scott? What's his reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: He is aware of that, Kevin, and the reason I can't offer you a reaction is that the police officer in question is facing civil rights charges that were brought by the Department of Justice. So there is an ongoing legal proceeding, and I wouldn't want to say something or comment on this situation in a way that could have an impact on that legal proceeding.\nSo the Department of Justice is going to continue to do their work, and that is work that they have done independent of any sort of direction or opinion that has been shared by the President of the United States.\nQ: Any idea if the President might accelerate the number of commutations between now and the end of his administration? The New York Times had a fairly interesting piece, in one part lauding him for doing something on criminal justice reform that he was not able to do broadly, and yet they also point out that there are thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of people that might be candidates for that sort of special consideration.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, when the President was asked about this question back in August at the Pentagon, he made clear that there is a process that the Department of Justice is administering to consider individually the applications for clemency that have been submitted, and the President does not envision circumventing that process.\nHis expectation, and what we have tried to do particularly over the last year or 18 months, has been to turbocharge that process, to offer more resources to that process, so that it can function more efficiently, and to consider more applications. But I do not envision a scenario in which that process is somehow shortened or that we cut corners in that process so that more individuals can benefit from this clemency. The President believes that rigor being applied to that process benefits the American people and benefits those who are given this special opportunity for a second chance.\nQ: I know I've asked you previously about the President's comments about Pearl Harbor Day, and I know that there's something scheduled for later in the month. I'm just curious, how is he spending this particular Pearl Harbor Day? Is he reaching out to any veterans or doing anything in particular today?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific actions on the part of the President, but obviously he had an opportunity on Veterans Day, less than a month ago, to travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns, and to restate once again the profound debt that we owe to military veterans of all generations, including the Greatest Generation. And this was a generation that was summoned to action based on the tragic attack perpetrated by the Japanese 75 years ago today. And I think all of us, including the President, have thoughts of deep gratitude for the sacrifice and service of the Greatest Generation of Americans.\nAnd the President himself has talked quite a bit about his grandfather who served, I believe it was in the United States Army, in World War II in the European theater. And that's his own personal connection to that generation. And I think all of us, to one extent or another, even though many of them are no longer living, have our own connection to those who served and to those who fought and even those who died in ensuring that tyranny was defeated in World War II.\nQ: Last thing, I wanted to ask you about welfare reform. House Republicans are said to be considering laying the groundwork for a fresh effort to overhaul the food stamp program and coming up with different work and eligibility requirements. And I ask you that in part because I remember previously this month you talked about the steep decline in the rate of poverty growth in America. And so I'm wondering if the White House feels like now is a good time for a fresh look at SNAP.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the individual proposals that have been put forward by Republicans, so I don't know if I can comment on those specifically. But obviously, there was a government report earlier this year that indicated that poverty in 2015 fell faster in that year than in any year since the 1960s. I think it might be one indication that the anti-poverty economic strategy that President Obama has pursued worked pretty well.\nAnd that is true when you consider how significantly poverty has been reduced over the last year. It's also true when you consider how significantly wages for working people have gone up -- the highest on record that same report showed. And wage growth was actually higher for lower- and middle-income families than it was for those at the top. So it's not just that we're reducing poverty; we're actually making some progress in reducing inequality as well.\nI think it's a pretty good indication that the kind of strategy that we've implemented has worked. And if Republicans want to implement a new strategy, we'll see what impact it has. This sort of goes back to what I was saying to Michelle. If Republicans want to try a different approach, we'll have an opportunity to see if it works. We'll have an opportunity to see\n-- if by making some of these changes Republicans can further reduce the poverty rate beyond the historic success that we've had in reducing the poverty rate, we'll have an opportunity to tell.\nI'm skeptical that they'll succeed in doing that, but the American people have given them the opportunity to try.\nQ: By the measure of success you're saying that it's gone better under the President's program and the poverty rate is not rising at a faster rate -- certainly slower rate than it has in half a century. And I just wanted to throw a couple numbers at you. SNAP apparently serves about 44 million people at the cost of $74 billion. Those are 2015 numbers, but that's up significantly since 2008. So I'm just curious if it's going better -- based on your own assessment -- is it now a good time to maybe take a fresh look at programs like these?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President actually in his -- back in January, the President delivered his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, and one area that he identified in that speech was an opportunity to work in bipartisan fashion with Democrats and Republicans on a proposal that Speaker Ryan himself had long advocated, and that was essentially the expansion of tax cuts for low-income workers that don't have kids.\nUnfortunately, the Speaker of the House didn't take him up on that opportunity for cooperation. So I'm not suggesting that somehow there aren't further improvements that could be made. In fact, President Obama has offered his support for some of the ideas that Republicans have put forward to do that. I don't think that SNAP falls in that category, but I can't speak at length about the proposal just because I haven't seen it.\nBut there certainly are areas where President Obama would -- has already indicated his strong support for some of these proposals that he believes would have a beneficial impact on the economy and would further reduce inequality in this country.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask a couple of questions. First -- and I want to go back to the Trump thing and the phone calls -- how many times has President Obama spoken by phone with President-elect Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: We played this game a couple times over the last couple of weeks --\nQ: It's not a game, I'm asking a real question, though.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't say it wasn't a real question. What I'm telling you is I'm not going to get into the details of reading out individual phone calls. So they've spoken several times since their face-to-face Oval Office meeting just after the election, but I don't have a specific number to give you.\nQ: Okay, well, it's more than twice. We know that. Maybe three or four now?\nQ: I think he said \"a handful\" last time.\nMR. EARNEST: So I did say \"a handful\" last time. I'm saying \"several\" this time.\nQ: Two handfuls? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'm being intentionally ambiguous.\nQ: We know it's at least two times. Maybe three, four? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: April, I would suggest that maybe we pursue a more fruitful line of questioning, respectfully.\nQ: Respectfully. All right, well, now, on Donald Trump and his comments this morning about how President Obama is a likable sort -- if, indeed, these two would have talked, do you believe -- earlier -- that some of this division, some of these, the thought process and some of the words may not have been used to cause the divide that continues right now in this nation? Do you believe if they had talked prior to the elections that we would not be seeing the efforts to come together because of the comments that were made?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, it's difficult to answer counterfactuals because nobody really knows. I think the one thing we do know is that Republicans laid out a very clear strategy on the day that President Obama was inaugurated the very first time, which is to block and obstruct every single thing that he tried to do and to, as much as they could, to try to delegitimize his presidency.\nThat was the strategy that was pursued by Republicans, and they did not succeed in limiting President Obama to one term. In fact, President Obama was not just elected once, but twice, with a strong majority of the American electorate. And that gave him a mandate to go and pursue an agenda that has benefited the American people. And that's everything from strengthening our economy, preventing a second Great Depression, rescuing the American auto industry, to reforming our health care system in a way that ensures every American has access to quality, affordable health insurance and can't be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition.\nIt also gave him a mandate to go and advance our interests around the world, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon by working through diplomacy and not firing a single shot, but actually confronting what most people, including some of our closest allies, had identified as the greatest national security threat that the world was facing.\nI could obviously go on at some length, and I'll stop. But the fact is President Obama has repeatedly sought to work with Republicans, but that ran counter to the political strategy that Republicans laid out to try to block him at every turn and to refuse to cooperate with him even on things they supported. And the country did not benefit from that. But this was a political strategy that has yielded some political benefits for Republicans. And a lot of that is what led to the election of Mr. Trump. But that will be something for historians and others to carefully consider.\nWhat I think the President's hope is that what all of you consider as you report on the next administration is to evaluate what impact their changes are having, particularly when you consider the strong trajectory that the country currently enjoys.\nQ: On your thoughts about Rahm Emanuel in Trump Tower?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, there are a number of Democrats that have accepted an invitation from the President-elect to meet with him, and it certainly makes sense that the mayor of the third-largest city in the country might want to have a conversation with the President of the United States.\nQ: And lastly, going back to what Kevin said about -- more so about the area and what happened -- Charleston, North Charleston area. It was in the news last year. It caused a lot of change in the mind and in the heart and on so many levels -- President Obama, weeks after what happened to Walter Scott, President Obama was there. He preached a sermon for the nine that died in Mother Emanuel church. And now Dylann Roof is -- the jury has been seated in this trial. What does the President say, looking back a year to today, after what happened? And I understand that you can't say much on the issue that is going to the federal piece. But what does he say about the area and how it made a mark in this nation from that time to today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I can't talk about the individual cases for the reasons that you cited, but I think both of these cases, just gauging by the news media interest, have captured the attention of people all across the country. And I think all of this debate and examination can sometimes be painful, but ultimately that's the kind of examination and debate that will be required to move the country forward.\nAnd the President gave a powerful speech -- a sermon at a memorial service in Charleston about 18 months ago, and that certainly captured the attention of the American people as well. And to the extent that the President was able to contribute to a healthy examination of some of these issues and a healthy debate and discussion and dialogue in this country, he's pleased with that.\nOne example, one manifestation of that is the way that a lot of people reconsidered their view of the confederate flag in light of these issues, in terms of what it symbolizes. That was a healthy thing for that country.\nBut this is going to be part of process. And there's not just going to be one event, or one landmark jury decision, or one heart-wrenching tragedy that's going to solve all these problems. This is going to be a process. And it's going to be a process that the President hopes the country can pursue together -- that the more that we can remember that the differences that unite are more powerful and more influential and more numerous than the things that divide us, that will certainly benefit us as we make our way down this path.\nQ: And the last question. You say it's going to be a process, and as we go through this transition, I'm thinking about that process that you said and what the President said in that sermon that he delivered for Reverend Pinckney. He talked about \"amazing grace,\" and he kept talking about grace. Is it about grace, or is it more so about heart, or is it about legislation as we deal with the newness of life for the next couple of months?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think more grace in our public discourse in every area, not just when it comes to national politics, I think is something that the entire country and all of our citizens would benefit from.\nKenneth.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Going back to Rahm Emanuel at Trump Tower today, we know that he urged the President-elect not to deport DREAMers -- of course, hundreds of young people -- or people who were brought here as children who were covered under the President's DACA program. Even in the past hour, there have been some Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who said they were encouraged by the President-elect's remarks, and people -- I think he said that we have to look at this and take a look at something that will work and that the American people would be proud, according to his words. So is the White House -- this White House -- encouraged by those words as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President has been crystal-clear, both in words and in deeds, about his view that young people who are American in every way but their papers shouldn't be deported, shouldn't be ripped away from family members, when the truth is that they came to the United States through no fault of their own.\nA policy of deporting them would be inconsistent with our values and one that would be a setback for the country, particularly when you consider the remarkable contribution that many of those young people have already made to our country, whether it's by starting a business, or signing up to serve in our military, or otherwise living as upstanding members of communities all across the country.\nSo I can't speak to what policy the next administration intends to pursue. I think the perspective and values that I've just given voice to are the kinds of values that enjoy strong bipartisan support not just in Washington and not just in Congress but all across the country. And hopefully Democrats and Republicans will be able to find a way to deal with this situation in a way that's consistent with our values, in a way that's consistent with our laws. And if they do, the country stands to benefit not just from a national security perspective, not just from a quality of life perspective, but also from an economic perspective as well.\nQ: I'm sure you would agree, there are a number of people -- undocumented immigrants and people who are covered under the President's executive actions who want to know what is this White House doing? You say you don't know what the next one is going to do, but we want to know what is this White House doing to have an impact and maybe even change some minds or policies from the incoming President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the thing that we certainly have done is we have taken quite seriously the transition process to ensure that the incoming administration understands\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the thing that we certainly have done is we have taken quite seriously the transition process to ensure that the incoming administration understands what policies we've pursued and why we've pursued them, and what impact it has had across the country. But ultimately, the next President will take office on January 20th. And his policies that will be implemented.\nQ: Finally, can you confirm a report that the First Lady held a good-bye party for White House staff and brought everyone to tears at a local pizza restaurant? I know there's a lot of good-byes happening over the next few weeks, or 44 days left. Can you confirm that? And were staff -- were they moved to tears? Were you one of them?\nMR. EARNEST: I was on the President's trip to Florida yesterday, so I did not participate in an event like that. But let me see if I can get you some more information about it, okay?\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Is it still the position of this administration that Assad must go? I know the President said that a few years ago. But does that stand?\nMR. EARNEST: That continues to be the policy of the administration. And again, it's not just because he stands in the way of a solution -- a diplomatic solution, although he does. And it's not just that we are so offended morally by his willingness to use the military might of his country against innocent civilians. There's also a practical consideration, which is that he has waged war on a substantial number of citizens in his country; his country has been torn apart; he has made it clear that he is unable to lead that country. And in order for us to find the kind of political solution that will bring that violence and chaos to an end, he can't continue to serve as President of that country. And that's been our policy for years. And it continues to be our policy today.\nQ: In the statement today, the five or six countries said that there must not be impunity for those responsible. Is that statement specific to Assad? And do you believe that he should face war crime challenges for what he's done?\nMR. EARNEST: That statement is an indication that there must be accountability, particularly with regard to the kinds of depraved tactics that have been used by the regime against innocent civilians. Accountability in these situations is necessary and consistent with our values as a country.\nQ: Let me ask you about the Cabinet that's being formed -- not specifically about specific picks, but the fact that there seem to be a large number of generals who have been chosen or who are being interviewed -- the Department of Defense, NSA, now the Department of Homeland Security, and potentially the State Department. Does the White House have any thoughts about the fact that Donald Trump seems to be potentially choosing a Cabinet that's very heavy on retired military?\nMR. EARNEST: No, just because I don't want to be in a position of criticizing or being -- even appearing to criticize decisions being made by the President-elect.\nWhat I'll say is that the President spoke as recently as yesterday about the values and leadership qualities that are exhibited by the men and women of the United States military. And many of the people that President-elect Trump has put forward are people that have served this country in the military with distinction. And that is -- even where political differences exist, that service and that commitment to sacrificing for the country are worthy of respect. The President certainly has exhibited that respect. I certainly tried to exhibit that respect.\nBut ultimately, what qualifications and criteria the President-elect wants to use in choosing his Cabinet is something that I'll let him decide.\nQ: Secretary Hillary Clinton is going to be on Capitol Hill for the unveiling of Harry Reid's portrait tomorrow. Is there any chance that President Obama will meet her, speak to her tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that they'll meet, but we'll keep you posted. I don't think I can commit at this point to announcing that meeting if it does occur. But let me see if I can get you guidance.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: John.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. Since the presidential election four weeks ago, the President has nominated numerous individuals to government boards such as the Surface Transportation Board, Legal Services Corporation, the Kennedy Center Board. Is it the President's expectation that the lame duck Senate will take up these nomination up or down?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, I actually don't know to what extent the individuals that you have named actually require Senate confirmation. But we can certainly have somebody take a look at that for you.\nQ: Is there an agreement with the Senate Majority Leader that the lame duck Senate will take up various nominations that require Senate confirmation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what sort of agreements, if any, have been reached with Senate Republicans.\nJC.\nQ: We had discussed the benefits of, in a sense, living above the store for the President, the immediacy to a crisis situation where he can meet in the Situation Room with his Joint Chiefs, his security team, members of Congress, et cetera. And the fact that Donald Trump has been choosing to stay -- at least for now -- at Trump Tower, and possibly maybe the first bi-city President, so to speak -- what in a sense -- now that we have a price tag, it's literally costing the American taxpayer and the New York City taxpayer in excess of $3 million a day to keep Mr. Trump safe in the tower. Do you have any additional thoughts about that? I know you made a comment about wherever the President goes, his security team is close by.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right. Look, over the years I have been in a variety of situations, in a variety of settings where I have fielded questions about criticism from Republicans with regard to the President's travel, and I'm not going to give into the temptation to do the same thing to the President-elect.\nMark Knoller, you had your hand up earlier. I'll give you the last one if you still have a question.\nQ: You bet I do.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: I wanted to ask you to clarify your answer earlier about the waiver for the Defense Secretary. Were you saying the President would not sign a waiver if it reached his desk, that he'd prefer it happen during the new administration?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think what I'm saying is the short answer to your question is, no, I was not signaling an unwillingness on the part of the President to sign a bill containing such a waiver. I think the observation that I was making is that it seems odd that congressional Republicans would be choosing to sneak a provision in a budget bill to expedite the confirmation of somebody who is a decorated Marine Corps officer, somebody who has served Presidents in both parties, somebody who Democrats and Republicans have spoken warmly of. So I can't really explain it.\nI'm not indicating that the administration will refuse to cooperate with them. In fact, the principle that I was giving voice to earlier was the idea that Presidents should be given some latitude to choose the people that they want to have on their team. The President was not extended that courtesy consistently by Republicans in the Senate, but it's a principle that the President believes in not just since he's coming in the door, but on his way out the door. And it's one that we'll -- that he believes in.\nSo, hopefully -- did that clarify --\nQ: You're saying a standalone bill on the waiver is the way to go?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I find it strange that Republicans in Congress seem to be taking an unconventional step to avoid the straightforward consideration of this waiver purely on its merits and on the merits of General Mattis's service to the country. So I think it's a question that I'm raising that I think is worth asking. But it's one that only congressional Republicans can answer.\nQ: And I wanted to ask about what the President said yesterday, that it was the last time he was going to hear \"Hail to the Chief\" on the road. What does that tell us about travel between now and January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's an indication that the President's travel between now and January 20th is likely to be limited, at least with respect to official events. The President does still intend to travel to Hawaii to spend time with his family there over the holidays.\nAll right? Thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:37 P.M.

Wait, wait, wait -- how are you all doing? (Applause.) Really? (Applause.) Are we excited? Are we ready to have some fun?\nCHILDREN: Yeah!\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, see, I like this group over here. They seem really excited. Can I get a little more excitement down there? Are we ready to sort some toys? (Applause.) Yes, this is what I want to hear!\nIt is beyond a pleasure for me to be here today, but before we get started I want to thank a few people, okay? Is that okay with you if I take a little time and thank some folks?\nI want to start by thanking Lieutenant General Pete Osman, who you just heard for -- not just for that kind introduction, but this man has been a leader. He's been someone I consider a friend. It has been a privilege to work with him for the past eight years, not just on Toys for Tots, but on so many different issues. He is a role model to me, and I treasure his friendship. And I hope there's more work that we can do together in the years to come. So let's thank General Osman. (Applause.)\nAnd I also want to thank Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, Ronny Green; your base Commander, Captain Frank Mays; and all my good folks from the White House Communications Agency. Let's hear it for my WHCA folks and your families. (Applause.) We are so grateful for your outstanding service.\nAnd I also want to thank Lieutenant Colonel Shane Donahue; Master Sergeant David Pizana, who has actually done all the leadership work on this drive. He has done amazing work, and I know he doesn't do it alone. He has a great team, so I am grateful to all of you for helping to run the Toys for Tots drive here in the D.C. area.\nAnd especially on what is the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, when we acknowledge the sacrifice of so many, I want to say a very special thank you to our servicemembers who are here today. I understand that we have everybody here. We've got Air Force. (Applause.) We have Navy. (Applause.) All right, don't embarrass yourselves, folks. (Laughter.) We've got Army. (Applause.) We have Coast Guard. (Applause.) They're always a little small, small and mighty. (Laughter.) And of course, we have our Marines. (Applause.) There we go, that's what I like to hear. And we have your extraordinary families from Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. (Applause.)\nBut I just want to hear -- I know that we have some military kids here, right? Where are our military kids? (Applause.) You guys are pretty mighty. We also have some other students here from the Al Fatih Academy. Where are you guys? Let's hear it! (Applause.) But we are thrilled to have you here today.\nAnd we have some special guests. Since this is my last official Toys for Tots drive as First Lady, we thought we wanted to make it a little more exciting, so we brought some good friends with us today. We have -- and let me know if you've heard of these people -- we have Doc McStuffins. (Applause.) Doc and I, I don't know if you know it, but we've done some film work together at the White House. We are good friends and good stars together, so Doc decided to join us today to meet all of you and to help us celebrate.\nWe also have some of the amazing stars of Disney Channel's \"Descendants 2\" and \"Bizaardvark.\" We have Sofia, Cameron, Madison, and Olivia. (Applause.) They're going to be helping you guys sort the toys. We also have hosts from Radio Disney -– we've got Alex and Betsy. Oh, there they go. (Applause.) They're here! So they're going to help you guys, because you guys are going to help us sort -- they're going to help you sort, okay? So they're our Santa's helpers today. Don't they look good? And they're very smart, and they work very hard. Way to go.\nAnd we are all here today to support the wonderful work that Toys for Tots has been doing year after year to make the holidays so much brighter for kids across this country. In fact, since Toys for Tots first started, they have sent more than 512 million toys to over 237 million children in all 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. That's pretty cool. (Applause.)\nAnd these folks work hard to get it done. This is not an easy task. They work for hours, sometimes in the cold and the wind and the snow and the rain, collecting these toys. And they spend weekends sorting the toys, shipping them to kids all over the country -- kids just like you all.\nAnd in the end, that's really what the holidays are all about. And I want to say this not just to the families here, but to the families who are watching. We have to remember that it's not just about the presents -- even though we're here to talk about toys for kids who don't have them -- but it's about the spirit of service -- the belief that in this country, we should look out for each other. And if someone, anyone in this country -- our neighbor, our classmates, our friends, people we don't even know -- if they hit on hard times, kids, it's up to us to be there for them, right, to help them, to reach out.\nBecause the truth is, is that no matter what anybody says, we are all in this country together. And I don't want you to let anybody else make you think anything different. You all all belong here. That is true. (Applause.) And that's true not just during the holidays, but every single day of the year. And that's what I've seen all across the country these past eight years as First Lady.\nI have seen it, first and foremost, in our military families -– in brave men and women who serve around the world, and they keep us safe. In the military spouses who work so hard to keep their families strong and together while their loved ones are serving. And of course, I have seen it every day in our amazing military kids, many of them just like you. I am so awed watching you young people step up when your mom and dad are doing some hard stuff. You step up at home and you take on extra chores. You keep an eye on your little brothers and sisters, even if they get on your nerves. That was a joke. (Laughter.) You're supposed to love your little brothers and sisters, even when they get on your nerves.\nI know you guys have to make new friends and get good grades in each new school that you have to attend, because military kids often attend 10, 12 different schools over the course of their educational lives. And you and your friends are from every possible background -- I want you to remember that -- from every race, every religion. And many of your families come here from all over the world.\nThat's what our military represents. It represents the true spirit of diversity in this country. So you all know that whether you attend classes at your local elementary school, or at Al Fatih; whether you celebrate Christmas or Eid; whether you go to a mosque on Fridays or synagogue on Sundays or church -- or synagogue on Saturday, church on Sundays -- we have to remember, especially our kids, we all love our country. We are all Americans. And as I said before, we all belong here, every single one of us.\nAnd that's something that we can all celebrate during this holiday season. It's something that we have to remember every day: How we are so beautifully diverse, but we have so much in common –- our love for our families, our pride in our country, our commitment to helping each other in times of need -- particularly in times of need.\nAnd I hope that everyone watching at home today takes that message to heart and considers giving back through programs like this one, like Toys for Tots, over the next few weeks before the holidays really kick in. It's not too late to pitch in. Folks can still go to the Toys for Tots website and give online, or you can go to the nearest drop-off station. That's what we did at the White House. We've done it for eight years. For eight years our staff has stepped up. And we came here today with cars filled with toys to contribute.\nSo on behalf of myself and the President and my family, I just want to thank you all for the privilege to serve, and thank everyone at Toys for Tots for everything you're doing. And we wish you all a wonderful holiday season, a Merry Christmas, and a happy and healthy New Year.\nAll right, let's get to work, you guys. Let's sort some toys, okay?

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122603", "text": "\"...the strongest foundation for human progress lies in open economies, open societies, and in open governments.\"\n–President Obama, September 20, 2011, at the launch of the Open Government Partnership in New York\nFive years ago, President Obama joined with the leaders of seven other nations to launch the Open Government Partnership (OGP), a global partnership between governments and civil society organizations to advance transparency and accountability, bolster citizen engagement, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. At the launch in 2011, the United States and other founding countries, along with civil society organizations, pledged to transform the way that governments serve and engage with their citizens in the 21st century.\nAs thousands of government leaders and civil society representatives gather together for the 2016 OGP Global Summit in Paris, the Partnership has grown into a platform for reformers in 70 countries. All participating countries endorse the Open Government Declaration, pledging to \"foster a global culture of open government that empowers and delivers for citizens, and advances the ideals of open and participatory 21st century government.\" Countries also pledge to \"lead by example and contribute to advancing open government in other countries by sharing best practices and expertise,\" thereby building collaboration and learning into the fabric of the Partnership. Civil society has an equal role in OGP, both in terms of in-country engagement with governments and within the OGP governing structure.\nMember countries have responded to  President Obama's call to develop specific commitments to promote transparency, fight corruption, energize civil society, and leverage new technologies. At the core of the Partnership is a high-level commitment from participating countries to undertake meaningful new steps as part of concrete Open Government National Action Plans (NAPs), developed and implemented in close consultation with their citizens. In its first five years, OGP countries made nearly 3,000 specific commitments to improve governance and public participation for some two billion people worldwide.\nThese commitments are leading to change and innovation in the way governments operate, interact with, and include their citizens. Countries around the world have implemented measures to prevent corruption and improve accountability in the public and private sectors, reformed government budgeting processes, enhanced public availability of expenditure data, rolled out e-procurement systems, and developed open data platforms to seek citizen input to monitor government policies, finances, and performance. Countries have developed in-person and online mechanisms to facilitate dialogue with civil society. Countries have also made important commitments to augment transparency through enhanced freedom of information and asset declaration laws and other efforts.\nSince its inception, the United States has supported the work of the Partnership, including by serving on the OGP Steering Committee, providing critical financing to the OGP Support Unit and supporting NAP implementation around the world. These global efforts include:\n•      Promotion and support of OGP as a key component of U.S. foreign policy efforts to combat corruption, advance transparency and accountability, and promote good governance worldwide.\n•      Joining with more than a dozen other governments in funding the OGP Support Unit, including its work with member countries and organizations. To date, the United States through both the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department has or intends to provide $5 million to the OGP Support Unit over four years, facilitated by a newly-signed grant.\n•      Targeted, country-led bilateral support for OGP implementation through USAID in more than a dozen member countries around the world, including more than $14 million in assistance last year alone. Country-level support to implement NAPs has included providing technical assistance to OGP member governments, strengthening civil society engagement and advocacy, and the design and procurement of open data technology tools.\n•      Sharing best practices and catalyzing peer learning among OGP's 70 member countries, on topics such as open data, natural resource transparency, anti-corruption, and access to information. Through peer exchanges, the United States is providing mentorship and support to the governments of Sri Lanka and Nigeria, two of the newest OGP member countries, and continues to collaborate with other OGP countries on shared priorities.\n•      Pioneering efforts, such as USAID's Accelerating Responsible Extractive Industry Resource Governance (ARTEIG) Research Award, to measure and improve the impact of OGP and other multi-stakeholder initiatives through $2 million for research, peer learning, and exchange activities.\nAs a testament to how truly global the open government movement has become, OGP's leadership and membership now represents all of the world's populated regions. The Partnership is also expanding to cities and other subnational governments around the world through a 15-city pilot program. The United States is represented in this subnational pilot by Austin, Texas.\nIn close consultation with civil society, the United States published its first National Action Plan in 2011. It included 26 concrete and ambitious open government initiatives. The final self-assessment report evaluating implementation of that plan was published in March 2013. The second National Action Plan was released in December 2013, and included 23 commitments that built on the progress made in the first plan as well as new commitments.  Additional commitments were added to the second National Action Plan in September 2014. The midterm self-assessment report evaluating implementation progress for that plan was published in March 2015 and the final self-assessment report was published in June 2016.\nThe third National Action Plan was published in October 2015 and included 45 initiatives that further built on earlier commitments to advance the President's commitment to an open and citizen-centered government and introduced new commitments as well. In September 2016, the Administration added further commitments to the third plan and also released a midterm self-assessment report evaluating implementation progress. The implementation period for this plan is through June 2017.\nThrough National Action Plans and everyday activities, teams across the U.S. Government have been working to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, strengthen accountability, and transform government engagement with the American people. To date, these initiatives have led to cost savings, fueled American businesses, improved civic services, informed policy, catalyzed research and scientific discoveries, driven transparency and accountability, and increased public participation in the democratic dialogue.\nU.S. National Action Plan commitments have increased public integrity, enhanced public access to information, improved management of public resources, and given the public a more active voice in the U.S. Government's policymaking process.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122604", "text": "\"When I look back on the great teachers who shaped my life, what I remember isn't the way they prepared me to take a standardized test. What I remember is the way they taught me to believe in myself. To be curious about the world. To take charge of my own learning so that I could reach my full potential. ...\nI've heard from parents who worry that too much testing is keeping their kids from learning some of life's most important lessons. I've heard from teachers who feel so much pressure to teach to a test that it takes the joy out of teaching and learning, both for them and for the students. I want to fix that.\"\n– President Barack Obama, October 2015\nWhen done well, assessments give parents, teachers, and students critical information on whether all students in a community are progressing each year toward college and career readiness. When used appropriately, they also serve as an essential protection to promote equity. In too many schools, however, redundant or low-quality assessments are being administered without a clear purpose. These ineffective assessments can consume valuable class time and can take the joy out of learning.\nThat is why last October, President Obama announced his Testing Action Plan and asked the U.S. Department of Education to work aggressively with states and school districts to make sure that tests students take are worthwhile; high-quality; time-limited; fair and transparent to students and families; and one of multiple sources used to understand how students, educators and schools are progressing. Since then, the Obama Administration has acted to assist states and school districts in ensuring that the tests they are giving are better, fairer and fewer.\nToday, the White House and the Department of Education will bring state and district leaders together with educators, parents, technologists, developers and philanthropic leaders to discuss the impact of the Testing Action Plan and what more can be done to ensure that tests are better, fairer, and fewer. As part of the event, the Department of Education is announcing additional resources and guidance for states and school districts aligned with the Testing Action Plan, including nearly $8 million in grants to the Maryland State Department of Education and the Nebraska Department of Education to develop new and innovative ways to measure science achievement that can serve as models for other states.\nThe event will feature remarks from U.S. Secretary of Education John King and will be livestreamed at www.whitehouse.gov/live/ beginning at 9:00 AM ET on Wednesday, December 7.\nNew Federal Resources to Help States and School Districts Improve Testing\nThe White House and the Department of Education are announcing new efforts designed to help states and school districts improve their assessments and help them evaluate the totality of their assessments in order to eliminate unnecessary or low-quality tests. Today's announcements include:\n•      $8 Million in Grants to Make Tests Better: The Department of Education is announcing nearly $8 million in funding to the Maryland State Department of Education and the Nebraska Department of Education through its Enhanced Assessment Instruments Competitive Grant Program (EAG). This round of EAG provides resources to improve the quality of state assessments used to measure academic achievement, to provide opportunities for innovation through the use of technology and the development of new, innovative item types, and to develop better scoring mechanisms for communicating and using assessment results to support teachers and students. President Obama's fiscal year 2017 budget included a $34 million request for \"Competitive Assessment Grants,\" the successor to the Enhanced Assessment Grants program under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The two projects funded this year support the work of to two consortia that represent eight states to develop high-quality science assessments.\no      The Innovations in Science Map, Assessment, and Report Technologies (I-SMART) Project, led by the Maryland State Department of Education and in partnership with Missouri, New York, New Jersey, and Oklahoma, will produce innovative science assessments aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards to support comprehensive alternate assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. It will contain multiple measures of student progress over time, develop a science learning map that includes multiple pathways for students to learn science content and reach challenging grade-level expectations, and also deliver score reports that improve the information about student performance that is shared with educators and families.\no      The Strengthening Claims-Based Interpretations and Uses of Local and Large-Scale Science Assessments (SCILLSS) project, led by the Nebraska Department of Education in partnership with Montana and Wyoming, aims to improve the quality of statewide science assessments. The project will leverage existing tools and expertise to generate more resources to strengthen states' ability to create and evaluate quality science assessments. The project will also engage state and local educators to clarify the interpretations and uses of assessments scores and to create tools to improve the usefulness of student performance results.\n•      Regulations to Create Better, Fairer, and Fewer Assessments under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA): The Department of Education is releasing two final regulations designed to give states and school districts clarity and flexibility as they implement the assessment provisions under Title I of the ESSA. These regulations seek to clarify the statutory requirement that states administer high-quality, annual assessments to all students by ensuring that these assessments are worth taking and provide meaningful data about student success and equity for all students, while also encouraging states and districts to continue to push the field of assessment forward through innovation.\no      Creating Better, Fairer, and Fewer Tests: The final regulation for state assessment systems under Title I, Part A -- which are the result of consensus reached when the Department of Education conducted negotiated rulemaking with a diverse group of stakeholders earlier this year -- will ensure states continue to administer tests that are valid, reliable, and fair measures of student achievement for all students, including by setting clear parameters for meaningfully including students with disabilities and English language learners in state tests and supporting them with appropriate test accommodations. The final regulation also allows states to take advantage of a range of innovative approaches to improve assessment and reduce overall burden, such as implementing computer-adaptive assessments and allowing a district to offer a locally selected, nationally recognized high school tests in place of the annual statewide high school assessment. Taken together, this regulation will help states and districts implement ESSA to create better, fairer and fewer tests.\no      Producing a New Generation of Innovative Assessments: The final regulation under Title I, Part B establishes the parameters under which states may take advantage of a new innovative assessment demonstration authority under the ESSA to create, try out, and scale up alternatives to traditional end-of-year large-scale assessments. This demonstration authority, initially available to up to seven states, allows states to rethink assessment systems and pilot new, innovative approaches to measuring student achievement for use in their accountability systems. States with demonstration authority will be allowed to phase-in and use a new innovative assessment system in a subset of their districts, while maintaining their existing system in the rest of their districts, and use the results from both systems for accountability and reporting purposes under the law during the pilot phase. States may also apply for flexibility as a consortium, providing a built-in community of practice to share and work through common challenges as they scale their new innovative assessments statewide.\n•      Guidance to States on How to Use Federal Resources to Create Better, Fairer and Fewer Tests: The Department of Education is also releasing non-regulatory guidance for states and school districts, which highlights flexibility in ESSA for how states and districts can use federal funds to support the President's Testing Action Plan. The guidance outlines how states and districts can use federal funding under the ESSA to ensure high-quality assessments for all students; reduce testing time; eliminate redundant, duplicative assessment; and provide clear, transparent and actionable information on assessments to students, families, and educators. This ESSA guidance applies starting in fiscal year 2017 (i.e., the 2017-2018 school year) and updates previous guidance ED released earlier this year.\n•      Profiles of Districts that are Taking Action to Improve Assessments: The Department of Education is releasing profiles highlighting the steps taken by two districts,  Eminence Independent Schools (KY) and  Vancouver Public Schools (WA), to reduce and improve assessments. Eminence saw dramatic improvements in student achievement after implementing a learner-centric education model that focuses on differentiated instruction, personalized learning, continuous growth, and the use of formative assessments and alternative means to assess student progress. Vancouver Public Schools conducted an audit of its district-required assessments in 2015 and eliminated 105 administrations of district-required assessments allowing the district to return an average of 900 minutes back into the classroom across grades 3 – 8. These profiles build on a report the Department released in April, highlighting the work of leading states and districts to improve assessment and ensure class time is preserved.\n•      Information on Technology-Delivered Assessments Supported by the Institute of Education Sciences:  The Institute for Education Sciences (IES) is releasing a blog that highlights some of the technology-delivered assessments funded through IES. Since its inception in 2002, three IES programs, including the Research Programs at the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and at the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER), and the ED/IES SBIR program have made over 200 awards supporting the development of new technology-delivered assessments. The awards were made to a mix of academic researchers, entrepreneurial firms, and larger education organizations. All of the projects included a rigorous research and development process with studies to validate that assessments are measuring what is intended and pilots to test the promise of the technologies for improving student learning outcomes. Later this month IES will release a more detailed report highlighting the technology-delivered assessments and innovations in the assessment field funded through three research programs.", "timestamp": "2016-12-07", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces New Steps to Create Better, Fairer and Fewer Tests in Schools"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122605", "text": "The White House launched the Equal Pay Pledge in June at the first-ever United State of Women Summit, encouraging companies from across the American economy to take action to advance equal pay. Today we are announcing new signatories to the White House Equal Pay Pledge and highlighting the critical role that businesses can play in reducing the national gender pay gap.\nThese 44 newly-committed employers bring the total number to more than one hundred companies and organizations that collectively employ millions of Americans. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers, including AT&T, eBay, The Estйe Lauder Companies, InterContinental Hotels Group, Mastercard, Yahoo, Square and Zillow Group.\nEqual Pay has been an Administration priority since President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law as his first piece of legislation. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses to attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy.\nToday, women make up nearly half of the U.S. labor force and more women than ever are the breadwinners in their families. More women are also working in positions and fields that have been traditionally occupied by men. Yet in 2015, the typical woman working full-time all year in the United States earned only 80 percent of what the typical man earned working full-time all year. The pay gap is even greater for African American and Latina women, with African American women earning 63 cents and Latina women earning 54 cents for every dollar earned by a white non-Hispanic man. The gender wage gap continues to be a very real and persistent problem that continues to shortchange American women and their families.\nemployers for Pay Equity Business Consortium\nThis year on Women's Equality Day, a group of White House Equal Pay Pledge employers formed an independent business consortium,  Employers for Pay Equity—to help private industry players share best practices and develop better hiring, promotion, and pay policies. Today, Employers for Pay Equity is announcing a partnership with Simmons College to carry the consortium's work forward. Simmons College will play a leading role in hosting the consortium to establish pay equity as a best business practice and a means to grow a more equitable workforce for all Americans.\nThese private sector companies and organizations share a commitment to equal pay and their pledges build on the Administration's record of empowering women and girls.\nBy signing the Equal Pay Pledge, these employers are:\n•      Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap.\n•      Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations.\n•      Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers.\n•      Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives.\n•      Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers.\nWe thank all who have joined in this pledge and encourage the business community to continue to implement and uphold pay equity policies.\n***\nWHITE HOUSE EQUAL PAY PLEDGE\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation President Obama signed into law. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the gender pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. Yet, the typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 80 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns. While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all.\nBuilding on the Administration's numerous actions to close the national pay gap, the White House challenged businesses to take the Equal Pay Pledge. Several U.S. private sector companies have come together in support of advancing equal pay.\n***\nWe received a very positive response to the pledge and welcome our new signatories, including the employers below.\nThese signatories put forth their pledges as follows:\nEqual Pay Pledge\n•      Adobe is proud to join the list of companies committed to equal pay. Paychecks are important, not only because they cover the needs of employees and their families, but also because they are an important indicator of fair treatment. Gender should have no part in driving pay decisions.\nWe have already reported our U.S. pay data relative to gender and race, and we will continue to report our pay data annually. This equal pay commitment is part of a larger diversity and inclusion strategy with three key areas of focus: building a diverse talent pipeline; broadening our recruiting efforts to ensure a diverse candidate pool; and helping all employees grow once they are part of Adobe.\nInvesting to bring out the best in everyone, regardless of gender or background, contributes to the success of the business and the most important asset - our people.\n•      Amalgamated Bank is proud to take the White House Equal Pay pledge to keep compensation fair, to practice our own values of fairness, diversity and inclusion, and to never stop looking for ways to do better. We believe that pay equality isn't an accomplishment, it's standard operating procedure. For nearly 100 years, Amalgamated Bank has been the progressive bank for the progressive community. We strive to lead by example among financial institutions and ensure equal access to financial services for all people, which also means that our own employees receive equal pay for equal work. By helping those both inside and outside the bank who do good do better, we believe everyone benefits.\n•      AT&T's commitment to diversity and inclusion has been visible and steadfast for nearly half a century. It dates back to the establishment of our Supplier Diversity Program in 1968, and our first Employee Resource Group in 1969. Today, more than 120,000 employees have active memberships in our Employee Resource Groups and Employee Networks.\nDiversity and inclusion is essential to our culture and our success. It fosters big ideas, fresh perspectives and opportunities, and bold leadership. It plays an essential role in innovation, and it helps us play a more vital role in our communities. Engaging in practices that support diversity, inclusion, and equality is a basic part of how we do business.\nSigning on to the White House Equal Pay Pledge reinforces and validates what we already deliver to our employees: equal pay for comparable work, experience and performance, regardless of gender, race, religion, or age. We're proud to continue the practices that have created our fair and equitable workplace.\n•      Autodesk today announces that we are signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge. Autodesk looks at inclusion comprehensively—how we attract, retain and develop top talent; how we include the widest range of entrepreneurs and developers using our software in our ecosystem; and how we expand opportunity globally to underrepresented segments of society. Equal pay is at the foundation of inclusion—this means we consider all of our employees, with all of the dimensions of diversity that they bring, whole contributing members of our organization deserving of equal compensation.\nWe currently conduct an annual review our compensation packages based on gender and ethnicity, but we recognize there is still much more to do and that signing this pledge is a commitment to ongoing self-reflection and analysis as an organization, which is why we do not take this lightly. In addition to a commitment to equal pay, our signature is also a commitment to creating and maintaining an inclusive environment where people can contribute fully and achieve personal and professional success.\n•      Colgate-US has long been highly committed to the principles of fairness and equity the White House Equal Pay Pledge serves to support and is proud to add its name to the number of organizations taking this pledge.\n•      eBay - For more than 20 years, eBay has sought to build a company that supports Connected Commerce – commerce that is enabled by people, supported by technology, and open to everyone. In accordance with our vision, we believe deeply that we must have a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace to ensure we reflect the perspectives of the tens of millions of customers that we serve globally. That's why eBay is proud to join with the White House in pledging to close the gender wage gap.\nWe at eBay are committed to ensuring that we pay our people fairly based on their role, contribution and impact – not on factors unrelated to the work they do. We have supported strategic initiatives, like our Women's Initiative Network (WIN) and eBay Women in Technology (eWIT), that aim to support gender diversity in our workplace and the ability of women to build lasting, successful careers at our company. Additionally, in early 2016, we undertook an extensive, global study of gender pay equity that considered the main components of compensation. We are pleased to report that our study found pay parity between male and female employees.\nGoing forward, we are committed to conducting on-going reviews of our compensation practices and, when necessary, we will take appropriate action to make sure that our employees continue to be paid fairly and equitably. Ongoing commitment to equal pay principles is essential to ensuring we deliver on this pledge, and we will continue to review our practices globally to make sure we are creating the best possible workplace for all of our employees.\n•      Edison International, we understand that diversity of thought is fueled by diversity of people engaged in an inclusive and fair work environment. We are committed to ensuring that gender pay equity is a part of the fairness experienced by all of our employees. Therefore, we are pleased to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge.\nWe are a diverse company that succeeds when our employees are able to bring their best selves to the workplace. The ability to attract, retain, and develop a diverse workforce allows us to leverage our unique experiences, better reflect the communities we serve, and ensure equity and inclusion that benefits both our company and our customers.\nAs part of our pledge, we commit to continue our annual review of compensation, which is used to understand any potential gaps in pay and to take action when appropriate. In addition, Edison International aims to further increase equal employment opportunities and to break down employment barriers by continually seeking diverse representation in our hiring and promotional opportunities. We continue to analyze and evolve our pay practices and market demands for talent and to foster an inclusive work environment where our employees can fully contribute, find opportunities for advancement, and feel valued.\n•      The Estйe Lauder Companies is honored to partner with the White House in its effort to promote gender equality in the workplace.\nAs a Company founded by a pioneering entrepreneur, Mrs. Estйe Lauder, we are proud to continue her legacy of empowering women, supporting families, and promoting equality.\nFounded on strong family values 70 years ago, we have always believed that our people are our greatest asset. We take pride in maintaining a unique, creative and diverse workforce where everyone's contributions are fairly rewarded. We are proud that women constitute 85% of our employees worldwide, with 50% of our senior vice president positions and above in the U.S. held by women.\nWe understand that equal pay not only affects women but also their families, their communities, and our shared economy. By signing the Equal Pay Pledge, we are underscoring our commitment to ensure that all women and men are compensated fairly in terms of capabilities and experience.\nWe remain committed to providing a dynamic and supportive workplace for all our employees to foster their growth, success and well-being.\n•      Exelon is pleased to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and we are committed to doing all we can to help close the national gender pay gap. Research shows that the typical American working woman makes 79% of what the typical working man makes – this translates to a loss of $500,000 over her lifetime. For Latino and African American women this cumulative loss nearly doubles. Diversity and inclusion is critical to Exelon's success and our workforce programs must include transparency and fairness. As a result, we are joining other leading companies and conducting an annual audit of compensation, hiring and promotion practices. Through these efforts, Exelon is stating unequivocally that we value every worker, male and female. Advancing pay equity is not simply good business practice, but the right thing to do.\n•      The Honest Company is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and join the other companies who have taken on this economic and social imperative. Our mission – to empower people to live a happy & healthy life - is at the heart of our business, and our company culture embodies our name: Honesty, Transparency, Openness. This applies both to how we treat our consumers as well as our employees. Diversity and gender equity are strategic pillars for our organization, and we are committed to ensuring all employees benefit from a workplace that is inclusive and fair. We are proud to stand with the White House and other companies who share these values.\n•      InterContinental Hotels Group: Our ambition is to be number one for guests, owners and colleagues. A critical part of this ambition is our commitment to upholding equitable compensation practices regardless of race, gender or ethnicity. That's why we are pleased to sign the White House pledge.\n•      Mastercard: We believe that diversity and inclusion are essential to creating an inclusive environment for our colleagues, helping them to better serve our customers worldwide. At the same time, to ensure that our employees reflect the customers we serve and today, we source talent from numerous industries and backgrounds.\nWe are committed to this important pledge and will continue to review and enhance our policies and practices to ensure they reflect our values and connecting our employees to \"Priceless Possibilities.\" Our \"Whole You\" program is based on the premise of providing benefits to employees at different stages of life both at work and outside of work.\n•      MWWPR was founded 30 years ago on progressive ideals that continue to fuel our vision, inspire our progress, and motivate our employees today. Our agency's ethos of \"Matter More\" serves as our guiding principle - we strive to not only help our clients matter more to the people who matter most, but to ensure that all our employees feel valued for the contributions they make.\nEngaging and retaining our incredible staff is our agency's highest priority, and demonstrating fairness and inclusion is fundamental to our talent strategy. Our management committee is comprised of a majority of women, many of whom actively mentor junior female colleagues, and we regularly review our hiring and promotion processes to ensure we are evaluating and rewarding all employees equally.\nFor MWWPR, signing the Equal Pay Pledge is an important next step in demonstrating our commitment to our people, and we are honored to be the first public relations firm to take the pledge. We hope to inspire our colleagues in the industry to make a similar commitment, and are proud to stand with other leaders in the business community as we continue prioritizing equality and transparency across our agency.\n•      Nestlй in the US: At Nestlй, we value our employees' health and wellness, which includes the opportunity to work in an environment where one feels empowered, appreciated and respected. Enhancing gender balance in our workforce is one of our company's core societal commitments, globally and in the U.S., which is why each of our operating companies in the US is pleased to reaffirm our commitments by signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge.\n2016 marks Nestlй's 150th year in business and we know that in order to be in business for the next 150, we must promote inclusive opportunities that respect the contribution of all of our employees. Nestlй believes that striving towards equal pay, fair hiring, retention and promotion practices, and investing in leadership and professional development opportunities for women is good for our people, our consumers and our business. We remain dedicated to enhancing gender balance in our workforce. To that end, we will continue to invest in programs including providing support for dual-career spouses as part of our International Dual Career Network, hosting networking events in conjunction with the Network of Executive Women Leadership Summit, continuing to find opportunities to publicly celebrate the accomplishments of our women executives throughout our businesses and encouraging eligible employees to take advantage of our Parent Support Policy, which offers up to 14 weeks of paid leave for primary caregivers with the option of extending unpaid leave up to six months.\nEach Nestlй business in the US will continue to review its hiring practices, assessments, and promotion decisions at the business level on an annual basis and work towards improving our ability to achieve gender balance and foster an equitable environment for all of our employees.\n•      New Belgium Brewing is proud to sign on to the White House Equal Pay Pledge. As a 100% employee owned company, we know that when we take care of one another our workplace and our business are healthier. We're proud to have women and men in every part of our company working side by side, earning wages that reflect our commitment to equal pay, advancement based on merit, and a spirit of community.\n•      SoulCycle: Led by a female CEO and founded by two women, SoulCycle's commitment to supporting and advancing women has always been part of the company's DNA. The support and respect that we extend to each rider who walks through our 67 studio doors extends to our company-wide culture. We're committed to nurturing the health and happiness of all of our team members, and that includes our hiring practices and compensation. As a company, we understand the importance of supporting and advancing women throughout their careers, and we know that our team thrives when they're compensated fairly for their contributions. We're proud that women make up 86% of our studio leadership.\nWe applaud the White House for its efforts to eliminate the gender wage gap and promote equal pay. We pledge to continue taking action individually and collectively as a team to pay equality.\n•      Square is proud to sign the Equal Pay Pledge as a natural extension of our existing commitment to pay equity. Square was built on the principle of inclusion which is reflected not only in the products and services that we provide to our sellers, but also in our internal policies and work environment. We strive to recruit, retain, promote, and compensate our employees on the basis of their qualifications, performance, and potential. We also work with our managers and employees in efforts to prevent gender-based bias from entering the workplace. Most of all, we are committed to continually reviewing our policies and practices to identify and act upon further opportunities for improvement—we will always strive for inclusion, fairness, and equality.\n•      Workday - Since day one, we've embraced diversity – including different experiences, perspectives, insights, backgrounds, and skills – because it fuels innovation, and creates a broader connection to the world. We believe that all employees deserve equal pay, and an equal chance to succeed. That's why we're proud to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge, as it supports our ongoing commitment to close the gender wage gap.\nAs part of this commitment, we've developed reporting capabilities within our product that can uncover and potentially address the gender wage gap. We and many of our customers use these reporting capabilities to evaluate our pay practices to ensure our employees are compensated fairly. Knowledge is power, and we believe that technology can provide the information organizations need to create a more equal and inclusive workplace.\n•      Yahoo, with more than one billion unique users across the world each month, has a distinct opportunity to leverage the power of our platforms to advance inclusion and diversity at the company, and across the tech industry. We recognize that building an inclusive and diverse workplace is more than a theoretical goal. It is a mission-critical business imperative that we must address with the same level of urgency and commitment that we apply to other strategic initiatives. And pay equity is a critical and inextricable component of this mission.\nWe are proud to have been recognized in 2015-2016 for our strides in paving the way for gender equality (Watermark Index Award winner), for being a best place to work for LGBT employees (scoring 100% on Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for the tenth year in a row), for being a best place to work for parents (named by Elle Magazine and Fatherly.com), and by being named as an employer whose work significantly impacts communication access for people with hearing loss (receiving the National Access Award by the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA)).\n•      Zillow Group is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and join other companies who are committed to this effort. Zillow Group evaluates pay equity twice a year, is building out training to be aware of our unconscious biases, and reviews hiring and promotion processes. We are constantly striving to ensure that our compensation and benefits package matches our values of inclusion and equity. In addition to our generous maternity and parental leave policies, Zillow Group offices have designated nursing rooms, fully equipped with hospital grade pumps and fridges. Since 2010, we have offered free overnight breast milk shipping for nursing mothers on business trips. As a company, we invest in our people since they are investing in us. We believe the private sector plays a critical role in reducing the national pay gap and are proud of our internal efforts to provide gold-star benefits and gender pay equity for all our employees.\nWE ARE ALSO JOINED BY THE FOLLOWING BUSINESSES:\n•      Association of Equipment Manufacturers\n•      AttainIT\n•      Avanade Inc.\n•      Avila Retail\n•      Branding Brand\n•      Cava Grill\n•      DCode42\n•      GBD Architects Incorporated\n•      Global Experience Specialists\n•      Harris Miller Miller & Hanson Inc\n•      Hired, Inc.\n•      Margaux's Bookkeeping, Inc.\n•      Omada Health\n•      Periscope Data\n•      RizePoint\n•      Robinson & Kardonsky, P.C.\n•      Spottswoode Winery\n•      Stanton Chase International\n•      Teslights LLC.\n•      Thrive Global\n•      Venesco LLC\n•      Vmware\n•      Vonage\n•      WP Engine\nBUILDING ON A RECORD OF SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES\nSince taking office, President Obama and his Administration have taken a number of actions to support working families and combat the pay gap, including:\n•      Publishing a final regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014. The program provides subsidies to working families and last year provided services for roughly 1.4 million children aged 0-13, most of whom are younger than 5. The rule, which has not been comprehensively revised since 1998, will provide a roadmap to states on how to implement the new law and clarify ambiguities around provisions that deal with eligibility for services; health and safety requirements; and how best to support the needs of parents and providers as they transition to the new law. It also clarifies that worker organizations can provide professional development to child care workers and contribute to discussions around the rates states set for subsidies.\n•      Signing his first piece of legislation as President, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pair Act, in January 2009 making it easier for employees to challenge unfair pay practices.\n•      Creating the National Equal Pay Task Force in January 2010 to implement his pledge to crack down on violations of equal pay laws, which included representatives from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management. The Task Force has issued reports on its progress, including Fighting for Equal Pay in the Workforce, Keeping America's Women Moving Forward, and Fifty Years After the Equal Pay Act. In addition, since the creation of the Equal Pay Task Force in 2010, the EEOC has received over 18,000 charges of sex-based pay discrimination, and through its independent enforcement efforts, the EEOC has obtained over $140 million in monetary relief for victims of pay discrimination on the basis of sex.\n•      Calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by closing loopholes in the defenses for equal pay violations, providing stronger remedies, and expanding protections against discrimination for employees who share or inquire about information about their compensation at work.\n•      Signing a Presidential Memorandum in May 2013 directing the Office of Personnel Management to develop a government-wide strategy to address the gender pay gap in the federal workforce, leading to a report in April 2014 and new guidance in July 2015—which cautioned against reliance on a candidate's existing salary to set pay, as it can potentially adversely affect women who may have taken time off from their careers or propagate gaps due to discriminatory pay practices by previous employers.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in April 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in September 2015 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation.\n•      Announcing a White House Equal Pay Pledge, with more than 50 leading businesses signing on to take action to advance equal pay. By signing the pledge, these companies are committing to conduct an annual company-wide gender pay analysis, review hiring and promotion processes, embed equal pay efforts in broader equity initiatives, and identify and promote best practices that will close the wage gap.\n•      Hosting a White House Summit on Working Families in June 2014, highlighting the issues that women and families face, setting the agenda for a 21st century workplace, and announcing of a number of steps to help working families thrive.\n•      Hosting the United State of Women Summit in June 2016, highlighting the progress that has been made over the course of this Administration and discussing public and private sector solutions to the challenges that still lie ahead.\n•      Signing a Presidential Memorandum in January 2015 directing federal agencies to advance six weeks of paid sick leave to federal employees with new children, calling on Congress to grant another six weeks of paid leave for federal employees, and calling on Congress to pass legislation that gives all American families access to paid family and medical leave.\n•      Publishing a final Department of Labor rule in May updating outdated overtime regulations, expanding overtime pay protections to 4.2 million additional Americans, boosting wages for workers by $12 billion over the next 10 years, and allowing workers to better balance their work and family obligations.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in February 2014 requiring federal contractors to raise their minimum wage initially to $10.10 an hour, indexing it, and lifting the tipped minimum wage (which disproportionately impacts women)—and urging Congress, states, cities, and businesses to do the same.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in July 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in December 2014 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating in employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n•      Directing the Office of Personnel Management and federal agencies to enhance workplace flexibility for federal employees to the maximum extent practicable, including enshrining a right to request flexible work arrangements.\n•      Signing into law the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010, which requires agencies to support and establish policies for telework by eligible employees.\n•      Calling on Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would require employers to make reasonable accommodations to workers who have limitations from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions (unless it would impose an undue hardship on the employer). The legislation would also prohibit employers from forcing pregnant employees to take paid or unpaid leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow them to work.\n•      Finalizing a Department of Labor rule updating its sex discrimination guidelines for federal contractors for the first time since 1978, to align with current law and address barriers to equal opportunity and pay, such as pay discrimination, sexual harassment, hostile work environments, a lack of workplace accommodations for pregnant women, and gender identity and family caregiving discrimination.\n•      Collecting summary employee pay data from certain employers to improve investigations of possible pay discrimination, which remains a contributing factor to persistent wage gaps. Starting March 2018, The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will add the summary pay data to the annual Employer Information Report or EEO-1 report that is coordinated by the EEOC and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.\n•      Increasing investments to expand access to high-quality early care and education, including efforts under the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge program, Preschool Development Grants, Head Start and Early Head Start, and a landmark proposal that helps all eligible working families with young children afford high-quality child care.\n•      Announcing the Department of Labor's award of $54 million in \"Strengthening Working Families\" grants to help low- to middle-skilled parents access the affordable, quality child care they need to earn an education, participate in training programs, and compete for better-paying jobs in emergency industries.\n•      Expanding access for women to higher-paying jobs through a proposed rule updating equal employment opportunity requirements in registered apprenticeships and through a Mega-Construction Projects (MCP) Initiative at the Department of Labor.", "timestamp": "2016-12-07", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge"}

Over 2,400 American patriots lost their lives in the attack on Pearl Harbor: military and civilian; men, women, and children. Their sacrifice galvanized millions of GIs and Rosie the Riveters who answered the call to defend liberty at its moment of maximum peril. In the hours after the attack, President Roosevelt promised that \"the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.\" Thanks to the heroism of a generation, we did.\nToday Michelle and I join the American people in remembering those who gave their lives at Pearl Harbor, many of them not much older than boys, and in honoring their families: spouses, siblings, sons, and daughters who still carry the memories of their loved ones in their hearts. We give thanks to the veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor who faced down fear itself, met infamy with intrepidity, freed captive peoples from fascism, and whose example inspires us still. For out of the horrors of war, this Greatest Generation forged an enduring international order, became the backbone of the middle class, and powered America's prosperity. Their courage and resolve remind us of that fundamental American truth: that out of many, we are one; and that when we stand together, no undertaking is too great.\nOn this National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we also reaffirm that the work of securing and strengthening our Nation goes on. While we can never repay the profound debt of gratitude we owe to those who served on our behalf, we can embrace our commitment to care for and support veterans of America's wars from every generation.\nAs a testament that even the most bitter of adversaries can become the closest of allies, I look forward to visiting the USS Arizona Memorial later this month along with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. This historic visit will stand as a tribute to the power of reconciliation and to the truth that the United States and Japan—bound by an alliance unimaginable 75 years ago—will continue to work hand in hand for a more peaceful and secure world.", "timestamp": "2016-12-07", "title": "Statement on the 75th Anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor"}

The bipartisan passage of the 21st Century Cures Act is an example of the progress we can make when people from both parties work together to improve the health of our families, friends, and neighbors.\nThe Cures Act makes important investments that will save lives. First, for the families and communities that have lost too many loved ones to the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic, it invests the $1 billion I requested in my budget to address this crisis. Second, the bill answers the Vice President's call for a moonshot in cancer research by investing $1.8 billion in new resources to accelerate discoveries. Third, it invests nearly $3 billion to build upon the major biomedical research initiatives we have launched in my administration—known as the BRAIN and Precision Medicine Initiatives—which are tackling diseases like Alzheimer's and creating new research models to find cures and better target treatments. Fourth, the Cures Act takes important steps to improve mental health, including building on the work of my administration's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force. And fifth, the legislation advances the progress we've made in improving the Food and Drug Administration's drug development process by, for example, making sure patients' voices are part of those decisions.\nThis is a reminder of what we can do when we look out for one another. Like Joe Biden and so many other Americans, I've lost people I love deeply to cancer. I've heard often from those whose loved ones are suffering from Alzheimer's, addiction, and other debilitating diseases.

Some 200,000 civilians, including many children, in eastern Aleppo are cut off from food and medicine supplies. Aleppo is being subjected to daily bombings and artillery attacks by the Syrian regime, supported by Russia and Iran. Hospitals and schools have not been spared. Rather, they appear to be the targets of attack in an attempt to wear people down. The images of dying children are heart breaking. We condemn the actions of the Syrian regime and its foreign backers, especially Russia, for their obstruction of humanitarian aid, and strongly condemn the Syrian regime's attacks that have devastated civilians and medical facilities and use of barrel bombs and chemical weapons.\nThe urgent need now is for an immediate ceasefire to allow the United Nations to get humanitarian assistance to people in eastern Aleppo and to provide humanitarian relief to those who have fled eastern Aleppo. The opposition have agreed the UN's four point plan for Aleppo. The regime needs to agree to the plan too.

UN SG Ban Ki-moon has spoken about war crimes being committed in Syria. There must not be impunity for those responsible. We call on the UN to investigate respective reports and gather evidence to hold the perpetrators of war crimes to account. We are ready to consider additional restrictive measures against individuals and entities that act for or on behalf of the Syrian regime.\nAt the same time, Russia is blocking the UN Security Council, which is therefore unable to do its work and put an end to the atrocities. The regime's refusal to engage in a serious political process also highlights the unwillingness of both Russia and Iran to work for a political solution despite their assurances to the contrary.

For years, Scott has been the go-to leader in resisting the Obama EPA's regulatory overreach. By standing up to unwarranted and unlawful policies, he has demonstrated rightful concern for Americans whose livelihoods and communities have suffered under intrusive, job-killing regulations. Under Scott's leadership, I have confidence we can implement commonsense policies that protect both our environment and our economy.\"\nU.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK)\n\"Scott Pruitt has been a leader and a partner on environmental issues for many years, said Inhofe. Pruitt has fought back against unconstitutional and overzealous environmental regulations like Waters of the U.S. and the Clean Power Plan; he has proven that being a good steward of the environment does not mean burdening tax payers and businesses with red tape. In his appearances before the Environment and Public Works committee, Pruitt has demonstrated that he is an expert on environmental laws and a champion of states' roles in implementing those laws. Scott is thoughtful, experienced and a natural pick for this role. I am pleased with President-elect Trump's selection and I look forward to working with my fellow Oklahoman in his new capacity.\"\nU.S. Senator James Lankford (R-OK)\n\"I applaud President-elect Trump and his team for choosing Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said Lankford. Pruitt has served Oklahoma as a tireless defender of justice and law, and I am confident that he will serve America well. I look forward to working with him to restore a balanced approach to regulations and governance that fosters economic growth, advances energy independence and ensures stewardship for the environment. Scott Pruitt knows the difference between a state responsibility and a federal responsibility. The American people deserve an EPA that rejects extreme activism and instead returns to its proper interpretation of environmental law.\"\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott\n\"President-elect Trump's selection of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the EPA proves he is serious about creating jobs and rolling back the burdensome regulations implemented by the Obama administration. As Attorneys General, Scott and I sued the EPA on several occasions as it continually ignored the Constitution and sought to implement rules, fees and regulations without congressional oversight or approval. I look forward to working with Scott as he brings common-sense policies to a federal agency that has been one of the biggest job-killers in the Obama administration.\"\nKentucky Governor Matt Bevin\n\"The small business owners, coal miners, and all the hard working people of Kentucky are very pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator. This nomination proves that the President-elect is listening to the American people who want fewer overbearing government regulation from Washington D.C. and more jobs on main street USA. Just like he has done in Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt will fight for the working people and job creators, while ensuring that the air and water are clean and safe.\"\nLuther Strange, Chairman, Republican Attorneys General Association\n\"President-elect Trump could not have made a better choice than Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. General Pruitt has been at the front lines of the fight against federal overregulation, including the unconstitutional Clean Power Plan. He understands the need to protect our environment while also allowing responsible development of our vast natural resources. RAGA is losing a valued member, but the country is gaining a talented individual who will help President Trump restore America's economic strength.\"\nMike Turpen, Former Oklahoma Attorney General\n\"I've worked with Scott Pruitt on a wide variety of issues since he became Oklahoma's Attorney General. I especially remember his opinion a couple of years ago in which he turned back a political challenge to the Oklahoma's Promise scholarship program run by the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education, a Board on which I serve. I have dealt with General Pruitt on a wide variety of other issues as well. In all of my dealings with General Pruitt I have found him to be an honorable man, a good family man, and a man of genuine spirituality.\n\"I can't say that I've followed everything that General Pruitt has done, but have always found him hard-working, honest, upbeat, and graced with a fine sense of humor. Scott is my friend, and I'm proud of his accomplishments and his upcoming appointment to administer the Environmental Protection Agency. I believe he will be fair minded and diligent in the performance of his duties. He will do Oklahoma and our Nation proud.\"\nLeslie Rutledge, Arkansas Attorney General\n\"Attorney General Pruitt has been a leader in fighting the over regulation that has been coming from the EPA for many years, said Attorney General Rutledge. I am confident that my friend, mentor and partner in this fight to combat unlawful regulations, General Pruitt, will be a great fit to bring much needed reforms to the EPA and make sure the agency is acting within the scope of the law. I want to see common sense regulations put in place that not only protect our environment but that allow farmers to feed the world and business owners to grow jobs across Arkansas and the country, and I know General Pruitt will make that happen.\"\nPatrick Morrisey, Attorney General of West Virginia\n\"My friend and fellow Attorney General Scott Pruitt would be an outstanding EPA Administrator. He's smart, principled, and the right person to reverse the EPA's unlawful actions that have hurt small business, job creation and states' rights. As the AG for a state like mine with bountiful natural resources, in Oklahoma Scott Pruitt has proven you can protect the environment and people's jobs at the same time.\"\nNan Hayworth, Board of Directors, ConservAmerica and former Member House of Representatives (R-NY)\n\"Scott Pruitt is very much in the mold of our nation's first environmentalist President, Theodore Roosevelt--an outdoorsman who understands the critical importance of stewardship. As head of the Environmental Protection Agency--which was founded by a Republican administration--Mr. Pruitt will be a strong partner for President Trump in effectively balancing protection of America's land, water, air, and wildlife with economic prosperity.\"\nOklahoma House Speaker-designate Charles A. McCall\n\"Today's announcement is incredible news not only for Oklahoma, but also for everyone across this nation that believes that states are sovereign and federal power is limited. Attorney General Scott Pruitt has been a champion for freedom and for Oklahoma for the last six years. As a citizen of one of the nation's leading energy producing states, I am excited for Oklahoma and for Scott, and I cannot think of a better choice for our nation at this critical agency.\"\nSenator Greg Treat, the Majority Floor Leader of the Oklahoma State Senate\n\"Because of the leadership of Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma has been the point of the spear in the fight against the unlawful and unconstitutional overreach of the EPA the past eight years. I've worked alongside Scott in recent years specifically to push back on the Clean Power Plan, and the EPA's attempt to circumvent Congress and the authority of the states to regulate and conserve their natural resources. No one is more qualified or better suited than Scott Pruitt to reign in the EPA, and restore balance to the agency's relationships with Congress, the states, and private industry. It certainly is great news for Oklahoma that one of our own has been appointed to a leadership position in the Trump administration, but it's even better news for our nation and the rule of law that Scott Pruitt will lead the EPA.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-08", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Praise for President-Elect Donald J.

As someone who has worked with CKE for more than three decades – from a restaurant crew member, to my current position as COO – I have personally witnessed the leadership Andy has demonstrated since he became CEO in 2000. He has always led CKE as an entrepreneurial company maintaining a focus on hard work and motivation instead of bureaucracy and red tape. Andy is someone who understands workers, their motivation, and what employees need in terms of job fulfillment and opportunities.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119845", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:43 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any comments at the top so we can go straight to questions. Mr. Freking, would you like to go first?\nQ: Sure. Thank you, Josh. So a Russian deputy foreign minister says Russia is close to reaching a deal with the U.S. on a ceasefire in Aleppo. Is the White House becoming more hopeful that an agreement can be reached?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, our approach to the situation from the beginning has been to listen carefully to what the Russians say, but scrutinize their actions. So, obviously, that statement is an indication that something positive could happen, but we're going to have to wait and see whether those statements are reflected on the ground.\nObviously, Secretary Kerry has been working tenaciously almost around the clock with the Russians and other countries in the region to try to reduce the violence in Aleppo so that humanitarian assistance can reach those communities that so desperately need it. And if that occurs, we obviously would welcome that development. And if that occurs, it won't be some sort of accident or coincidence or serendipity; it will be the product and result of skilled, principled, tough, tenacious diplomacy. And much of the credit will go the Secretary Kerry. But we'll see what happens.\nQ: Do you have any sense of a timeline as far as how long these discussions, these negotiations are expected to continue before there is some sort of either agreement or non-agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, as we've said before, there's no military solution to this problem. We can certainly use our military -- and we have -- to go after ISIL, to take back territory that they'd previously controlled and to take their leaders off the battlefield.\nBut when it comes to resolving the underlying political instability that has led to the chaos, that's going to require a diplomatic solution. And this diplomacy will continue until we can start seeing the political results on the ground that we would like to see, and that will include and be characterized by a reduction in violence and enough stability in the security situation that humanitarian assistance can consistently flow to needed areas.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to run the EPA. And I know you're not talking about nominations or any individuals, but in this case, would his confirmation really be game, set, match for the U.S. and other countries meeting their commitments under the Paris agreement? Or do you still view this agreement as setting an irrevocable trajectory toward the U.S. and other countries moving to clean energy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Kevin, I think this is a perfectly legitimate question. The President has, himself, observed that it's one thing to make grand pronouncements on the campaign trail, but once you enter the Oval Office and you're responsible for managing the affairs of the United States and being leader of the free world, reality has a way of intruding.\nWe'll see to what extent reality intrudes on some of the rhetoric that was used by the President-elect in the area of climate change. For example, he at one point tweeted that climate change was a manufactured hoax by the Chinese government. So that obviously is not substantiated by any sort of facts or evidence or science.\nBut as I've done in the context of other Cabinet nominees, it does seem appropriate to lay out some benchmarks and guidelines that illustrate the progress that we have made as a country and as a planet, in this case, based on the strategy that President Obama has pursued. And it will be important for the American people and for people in this room to compare the plans that are put forward by the next administration with the plans and results that were produced under President Obama's leadership.\nThis one I think I can do in relatively concise fashion. I think there are four areas that I would recommend.\nThe first is fuel economy. President Obama, when he first took office, had to make a difficult, politically unpopular decision to rescue the American auto industry, and that included working with the industry to put in place regulations that would increase fuel efficiency standards. In the eight years that President Obama has been in office, the average fuel economy for passenger cars and trucks has increased from about 21 miles per gallon to more than 25 miles per gallon. That's a 20 percent increase in fuel efficiency. That's good news. There certainly is more that we would like to see moving forward, now that we've got some built-up momentum. We'll see if it continues under the next administration.\nThe thing that I would point out -- and I think this is a relevant fact -- that increase in fuel efficiency was accompanied by record production by the American auto industry and record sales in the United States in 2015. So there was a sense that by increasing regulations and raising fuel efficiency standards -- this was a criticism of Republicans -- that the President was going to hamstring the American auto industry. The opposite has occurred. As we have seen an increase in fuel economy, we've seen record growth in the American auto industry. And that will be a standard that the next administration should be judged by because that is progress that was made based on a specific strategy that President Obama laid out.\nThe second, it's important to understand what kind of progress the renewable energy industry has made in the United States. Since 2008, the amount of energy produced by the wind has tripled while the cost of producing that energy using the wind has declined by 40 percent. The numbers as it relates to solar energy is even more dramatic. Solar generation has increased thirtyfold -- three zero -- thirtyfold since 2008 while the cost per unit of producing energy through solar means has reduced -- has fallen 60 percent.\nAnd that has led to a lot of economic benefits for the American people. The renewable energy industry in the United States employs 2.5 million people. And part of that renewable energy industry benefits from the international market that is created by countries around the world agreeing to reduce their carbon footprint. It means they have to consider adding wind and solar to their energy production mix, and the United States is poised to be a leader in that industry. And it is undermined, in part, by a unilateral withdrawal of the United States from that international agreement.\nThe third thing, CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption has fallen by more than 500 million metric tons per year from 2008 to 2015. That's a pretty significant reduction, and that reduction occurred even as our economy grew. There was a suggestion that we have to sacrifice economic growth in order to see the reduction in emissions that we had targeted, and, of course, the opposite has been true. Over about that same period of time, our businesses have created 15.6 million jobs over the last 81 months, and we continue to see an unemployment rate that is less than half where it was at the peak of the Great Recession.\nThe last statistic, and I think this is an important one, too, and has profound consequences for our national security, and that is the degree to which we've been able to reduce our country's reliance on foreign oil. In 2008, the United States of America was importing a little more than 11 million barrels of oil per day. That number has been cut in half -- more than in half, actually -- to 4.9 million barrels per day.\nSome of that is because of the support that this administration has shown to domestic producers of oil and gas; some of it is because of the investments and commitment that we've made to fuel efficiency; and some of it is the investment that we've made in renewable energy that give us alternative methods of generating electricity and powering our economy.\nThat's a strategy that's worked, and it has reduced our reliance on foreign oil in a way that has positive consequences for our national security.\nSo I know that was a little long, but again, these are benchmarks that are relevant to illustrating the progress we've made based on the strategy that President Obama has pursued. And given the fact that the President-elect has promised to pursue a different strategy, it's worth comparing whether or not his strategy will yield results that are as good as what we've been doing.\nThank you for the opportunity, Kevin.\nTim. Nice to see you.\nQ: Nice to see you. Along those lines, are you suggesting that some of these advances -- like the sort of conversion to natural gas and turning away from coal -- to some extent that these are tamper-proof by the next few years, by the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there clearly are market forces that are involved here. There are market forces that you're seeing other countries around the world -- in part because of the important international climate diplomacy that was led by the United States under President Obama's leadership -- has been considering a more diverse array of energy generation sources. And the United States is poised to benefit from that.\nThe best example I have of this is actually with regard to China. China made a significant commitment to cap their emissions, and part of that will be decommissioning or putting out of business some of their coal-fired power plants and investing in and building nuclear power plants. Those nuclear power plants are going to be, at least in part, built by American companies. That's American economic growth and American jobs that are the result of China making an important, self-interested decision to reduce their emissions and consider an alternative form of energy -- in this case, nuclear energy. And Westinghouse stands to benefit from that rather significantly -- a great American company.\nSo there are significant market forces that do counter the argument that's not rooted in science that's being made by the other side.\nQ: And of the four points, one thing you didn't mention is that sort of the President pushing the American people to pressure on this. Starting from the 2012 inauguration speech, and then you had a few years later the Keystone protests, and then environmental lawyers basically being the final straw that stopped Shell from drilling in the Arctic, the finding that they found that pressured Shell. So is there a feeling in the White House that that's going to continue, that this swell of pressure, and also make these things more tamper-proof?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's also -- in addition to market forces that are already at work here that are moving our economy and our country and our planet in a more healthy direction, that's not a historical mistake either. It has required presidential leadership by President Obama. It has also required the commitment and action of people all across the country who want to make sure that our planet is protected for future generations.\nThere's people in both parties; plenty of social conservatives are quite interested in making sure that we're good stewards of God's creation. And it turns out there's a way to be good stewards of God's creation even as we look for smart ways to grow our economy. And that's exactly the strategy that President Obama has pursued.\nQ: Just two more on this. Do you know how the President feels personally, having since well before the first -- when he was a senator, this was a big issue for him, and he was the first sitting President to go to the Arctic -- how does he feel that the Clean Power Plan and the Paris agreement could be vulnerable?\nMR. EARNEST: The President talked about this at some length in the context of the election. And the President is quite proud of the legacy that he's established in focusing not just America's attention but the world's attention on taking action to fight climate change. And the historic agreement in Paris is certainly a good, tangible example of what the world can accomplish when the United States is committed to playing a leading, principled role in solving problems.\nBut ultimately, it will be up to the next President to decide. And there's no denying that that progress is at risk because we've got a President-elect who has identified different priorities and has even been critical of some of this progress. And that's unfortunate, but elections have consequences.\nQ: And last one -- what are the chances that the President will be active in climate after January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you've heard the President say a number of times now, I think immediately after leaving office, the President is looking forward to taking some time off and catching up on some sleep, as he regularly tells Mark Knoller; taking his wife on vacation, and maybe even putting pen to paper and writing a book.\nSo I wouldn't expect aggressive public advocacy on January 21st, but is this an issue that the President cares about? It absolutely is. And it's not hard to imagine President Obama finding an appropriate way, as a former President of the United States, continuing to encourage people to advocate for building on the momentum that we've already achieved under the President's leadership in fighting climate change, and doing it in a way that ends up being good for the U.S. economy.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Senate is voting right now on the NDAA, which, of course, forbids the administration from closing Guantanamo. Assuming that it passes, is that the last word on the President's efforts to close Gitmo?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Dave, I would expect the administration to continue to pursue the strategy that we've been pursuing for almost eight years now, which is being engaged in an effort to reduce the prison at -- the population of the prison at Guantanamo Bay even as we do so in a way that we believe is good for our national security.\nContinuing to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay only gives terrorist organizations a recruiting tool. And what the President and his team have structured is a process for six different national security agencies to come together to review the individual case files of the prisoners, determine which of those detainees can be transferred to other countries and under what conditions. And once those transfers are approved, the State Department has to go to work in negotiating with other countries to ask them to accept these detainees and to apply these security restrictions.\nAnd ultimately that strategy has worked to reduce the prison population by more than 175 since President Obama took office, and to make the American people safer. But the President still believes that the prison should be closed. Doing so would make our country safer and would save taxpayers a significant sum of money. But there are obstacles to doing that that have been erected by Congress that remain in place.\nQ: Do you have any updates on the 58 or so detainees who are still there?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates at this point. But as we make transfers, we always announce those transfers publicly and we make public the name and destination of the detainee that's been moved.\nQ: Formally closing Gitmo is something the President has been trying to since day one.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, almost literally.\nQ: Why wasn't he able to make the case?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think that he and others, including myself, have repeatedly made the case that it's a case that Democrats and Republicans alike who are national security experts, have served in our military, have worked in the intelligence community -- they don't just understand the argument that we're making, they agree with it. The politics of this are potent, and Congress, in response to those politics, has made this a very difficult task.\nRon.\nQ: Just to follow up on the questions about appointments and policy changes that they seem to be signaling. Is it fair to say that -- on advocacy by the President -- you seem to suggest that we're not going to hear anything from the President in terms of advocacy or pushing back before January 20th. Is that fair?\nMR. EARNEST: In terms of --\nQ: The President reacting to what appears to be changes in the direction the country is going to go on major policy issues, like climate change, the Affordable Care Act, education, other areas where there have been appointments that seem to suggest -- that clearly suggest that there's going to be a different direction than what he would like.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think on November 9th we knew that the country was going to start moving in a different direction, even before any of those personnel appointments were made. So, look, I recognize why they come up in a setting like this, where you guys are interested in a reaction to those nominees, so I'm not suggesting that's that an inappropriate line of questioning, but it's certainly not a new one.\nQ: But I guess what I'm trying to understand is, is there a line? The President, in Lima, said something about how, if questions are raised about our core values and ideals, is I think the way he phrased it, that he would respond. And I think he was talking about in the post-January 20th period.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right -- as a former President.\nQ: Right. So it seemed like there was no line before that could be crossed before January 20th that would motivate the President to engage in some kind of discussion about these issues, because he is so committed to the idea of a smooth transition. But I guess the question -- and I guess I've asked it before -- is that desire for a smooth transition -- is there anything that the President could foresee happening where he would want to speak out more forcefully about the direction that the new administration is moving in?\nMR. EARNEST: I think particularly since November 8th and the morning of November 9th, I think we've gotten out of the business of predicting or foreseeing what may or may not happen based on the outcome of the election. What our approach has been and will continue to be is to prioritize the smooth, effective transfer of power. And that will require the President and a number of other officials in the U.S. government setting aside their own personal political views and putting the interest of the country, first.\nAnd that's a difficult thing, particularly when you consider the stakes of the election, and particularly when you consider how invested senior officials in the Obama administration have been in our success. But it's what the Constitution requires. It's what the American people have said is their preference based on the election. And we're going to fulfil the institutional responsibility of the executive branch to give the next President the best possible opportunity to get off to a running start.\nQ: But is there anything maybe you can say about any conversations that the President and the President-elect had and the level of engagement, advocacy, without talking about the substance of it?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything new on this. They've engaged in some consultations, but --\nQ: You can understand the questions.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Clearly -- I mean, I think we all understand the idea of a smooth transition, but clearly the country is going in a different direction that threatens so much of what the President and the team have done over the past eight years. That seems just obviously clear to most observers.\nMR. EARNEST: It was clear before the election.\nQ: Right.\nMR. EARNEST: And the President made a forceful case before the election and the President's candidate didn't win.\nQ: Right. And it would seem very difficult to just not -- stand idly by. But obviously you're doing some advocacy by listing all these accomplishments that you see in the area of the environment.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: I would just think it's very difficult for the President to watch this happen, to watch what seems to be his legacy unraveling and the things he cared about so passionately.\nMR. EARNEST: I think you might have slightly overstated it there. But, look --\nQ: I guess that's the argument. Am I overstating it? Or is he so convinced, as he's put it, that the realities of the office and the realities of the world are going to be such a difficult inertia to push back at that much of what he has done will stay in place?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see. I mean, that really is the answer. We had an opportunity to have this argument, and the President made it forcefully, and I think a lot of people were persuaded by the argument. The fact is, the candidate that he supported actually got more votes than the next President. So I think a lot of people were persuaded -- most people were persuaded by it.\nBut that's not the way that our system is structured. We're following the rules of the Electoral College. Those are the rules we signed up for. Many analysts actually expected that the rules of the Electoral College would actually give Democrats a built-in advantage. Didn't turn out that way. And the time for these kinds of debates, at least on the part of those of us who serve in the executive branch, has passed, because we've got a more important responsibility, and that is doing the will of the American people and ensuring a smooth and effective transition to the next administration, because that's what's in the best interests of the country.\nQ: But is he having any conversations with Mrs. Clinton while she's in town?\nMR. EARNEST: None that I can report and none that I'm aware of, but I can't rule it out.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about the President's thoughts about the DREAMers. Is there anything that he can do to protect their future vis-а-vis commutations or pardons? There's been some talk that that's something that he would strongly consider? And as sort of a secondary question on the same topic, is it fair to say that the President is strongly considering perhaps pardons or commutations for other high-profile individuals -- Manning, Bergdahl, Snowden, and others?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a whole lot to say about the clemency process. The President has talked about this at some length earlier this year.\nA couple things I can say. The first is, the President cannot use his clemency authority to legalize the immigration status of anybody, and that is why we pursued the executive actions that we did, and is why the President was such a forceful advocate for legislation that would correct some of the injustices and implement so many of the reforms that would improve our immigration system in a way that would enhance our national security, improve our country's fiscal situation, and obviously ensure that we're treating people fairly and giving America the benefit, the upside of immigrants who come to this country and create jobs, and serve in our military, and live in our communities, make the United States the great country that it is.\nWith regard to other clemency measures the President may be considering, and what the President has said previously is, he does not expect to essentially ram through any pardons at the last minute. There's an established process and the President believes that's a process that's worth following.\nQ: Let me just drill down a little bit on that. Given his appreciation, if you will, for history and the understanding of how his reputation would certainly be impacted greatly depending on who might receive clemency, be that -- if you want to look back Clinton and Mark Rich, if you look back at Ford and Nixon -- how much of that do you think is a consideration, do you think, for the President as he considers clemency for some of these higher-profile people?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess you'd have to talk to him about sort of to what extent history factors into his decision. What I know factors into his decision is the fact that we have worked very hard, particularly in the last couple of years, to stand up and expand the capacity of an existing process at the Department of Justice to consider clemency petitions that have been filed. And that has resulted in the President being able to offer clemency in the form of commuting sentences of more than a thousand people now. That is more than the past 11 Presidents combined. And that is an effort on the part of the President to use his executive authority to reform some aspects of the criminal justice system that don't seem particularly just.\nAnd the President would have preferred a more sweeping solution to that problem that only legislation could bring about, but that is not something that Congress was able to succeed in passing, despite the fact that there were high-profile Democrats and Republicans who supported that principle and did even support some pieces of legislation. But it is another criminal justice reform -- common-sense criminal justice reform that would be good for our economy -- that's another victim of Republican dysfunction in Congress. And, unfortunately, there are numerous victims, and that's one of them.\nQ: You mentioned solar a bit earlier. How much of the growth of the use of solar power is subsidized by the federal government?\nMR. EARNEST: We can get you the metrics here, but the performance of the loan program at the Department of Energy was remarkably successful. And I think the growth of the solar industry overall -- the fact that solar generation in this country has increased 30 times -- 3-0 -- since 2008 I think is an indication that that is an industry that's taken off. And that is an industry that is now not just competing in the United States for business, but they're competing around the world. And that's a good thing for our economy.\nQ: Lastly, yesterday, it was interesting -- you said \"The kinds of people President-elect Trump has chosen to appear have in many cases different priorities, different styles and, in some cases, starkly different bank accounts.\" I thought that was a pretty interesting statement by you. Obviously, talking today --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not the first person to make that observation.\nQ: Perhaps not. You've heard the former Ford CEO is someone that is also having a conversation perhaps with the President-elect. Does bank account matter? Or was that just sort of an off-the-cuff comment? How do you square that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned yesterday, I was just trying to get you guys to laugh. And again, if the joke requires explanation, it probably was not particularly successful. (Laughter.)\nQ: Last one I have for you -- there was a very interesting person in the room. What have you been able to draw from your friendship with the former press secretary, who happens to be in the back of the room today, and how have things changed?\nMR. EARNEST: If I seem a little nervous today it's because one of my predecessors is actually in the room today. Look, Dana did this job for President Bush for the last couple of years of his of his presidency, look, and she was widely acclaimed by people on both sides of the aisle for her integrity, her seriousness of purpose in doing this job. And she won a lot of admiration from people in Obama world by the way that she handled herself in the context of that transition in 2008 and 2009.\nThat surely must have been a very difficult thing to do, given the degree to which President Obama was promising to change many of the policies that President Bush had sought to implement. But she did a noble and, in some ways, uniquely American thing, which is that she set aside her own political views and actually was committed to ensuring that President Obama's press staff could understand how the White House works and could get off to the best possible start.\nAnd there is a tough learning curve when you walk through that door for the first time in understanding exactly what the expectations of the press corps are, and understanding how to operate all the levers of government in order to get the information that we need in order to come out here and make the President's case. But she gave us -- she was certainly more than an honest broker. She was somebody who was determined to try to help us understand exactly what the job required and what resources were available to us to do that job as well as we possibly could. And so that's why a lot of us have enduring respect for Dana and the way that she did her job. And it's been fun having her around here today.\nChris, go ahead.\nQ: I want to get your comment on a specific case. The ACLU is leading LGBT groups in calling for a clemency for Chelsea Manning, who is in the seventh year of a 35-year sentence for leaking classified information, has served in jail time longer than anyone else for that offense. Will the President commute the sentence for Chelsea Manning?\nMR. EARNEST: Chris, I'm not going to discuss individual cases. There is a process that's been established at the Department of Justice. For the way that those applications -- whether or not those applications have been filed and how they're being processed is a question you should direct to them.\nQ: Well, Manning is a transgender serving in a men's prison, was initially denied transition-related care before the Army agreed to it, and has a history of suicide attempts at the prison. Would those be factors the President would weigh in deciding whether to grant clemency in this case?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I wouldn't speculate on what factors the President may consider. So there's a well-established process for considering these clemency petitions, and I'd refer you to the Department of Justice for an update on why that may stand.\nQ: And the President has, of course, commuted a lot of sentences for a lot of individuals. Would there be some point at which they would stop? Or do you expect that to continue to happen right until January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that the process will continue to run until the end. But this is a process that cannot be done overnight, that these kinds of applications have to be filed well in advance, and there's a lot of background work that has to be done before decisions on individual cases can be rendered. So I would not envision a rush to the exits here, but I would anticipate that the process will continue until the last day.\nJessica.\nQ: A question on trade. The WTO makes a decision on Monday about whether China should be granted Market Economy Status. I wanted to see what the White House position on that is and what your concerns are for the ramifications for U.S. companies.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a determination that's actually made by the Department of Commerce. And so we'll let the analysists at the Department of Commerce take a close look at the Chinese economy and come to a decision based on the merits.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, real quick, fine point. The NDAA -- the President will sign it as written?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a position on that to disclose at this point, but why don't we consult with our staff and we'll get back to you on that.\nQ: On the CR, apparently Nancy Pelosi just said she's going to oppose it. You got the Congressional Ball here today. Are you going to be sending everyone home to finish their work?\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) Maybe they'll negotiate in their gowns and tuxedos. That would make for quite a picture.\nQ: Well, some arm-twisting, perhaps.\nQ: No coverage. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, maybe we should change it here for the end, huh?\nQ: Hear, hear.\nQ: Are you confident there won't be a government shutdown?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, as I told Kevin, when it comes to predicting the behavior of Republican politicians in Washington, I'm not going to do that.\nQ: Nancy Pelosi says she opposes it.\nMR. EARNEST: Right. But ultimately we've got Republicans in charge of the House, Republicans in charge of the Senate, and if they want to get any bill passed and signed into law, they're going to have to work with Democrats to get it done, in part because there are recalcitrant Republicans in the House, many of whom appear opposed to any kind of CR, so it's possible they may need many Democratic votes to pass it. When you consider the well-chronicled and widely discussed rules in the Senate, it's likely that Democratic votes will be needed to advance the legislation. And, of course, the bill has to be signed into law by a Democratic President.\nSo Republicans are in charge of those two branches of Congress. Congress has one basic responsibility -- well, they've got many basic responsibilities -- but among the more important basic responsibilities is passing a budget for the U.S. government and making sure that the government can function. And it sure would be a shame to shut the whole thing done just a couple of weeks before Christmas.\nQ: And on Syria, you said you're not -- you're hopeful, but you don't know about a deal yet. Riyad Hijab, who's a Syrian prime minister who defected and is now the political leader of the opposition that the U.S. and (inaudible) recognize -- had some blistering criticism that I want you to be able to respond to. He told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that \"history will never forgive Obama for what he has done to the Syrian people. He has raised their expectations, and then he gave Bashar al-Assad the green light,\" talking about strengthening Iran's position in Syria, saying that Assad must go and not doing anything to oppose him. How do you respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, given the tragedy that has befallen his country, it's not surprising to me that he's using some rather pointed rhetoric to make his argument. But ultimately, the President of the United States has one overriding responsibility, and that's to look out for the interests and safety of the American people. And that's what President Obama has prioritized over everything else. We certainly have been deeply concerned about the plight of the Syrian people, and that's why the United States has devoted significant time and attention and resources to trying to bring that violence to an end.\nThe President and the United States have played the leading role in the international community to reach the kind of negotiating, diplomatic solution that will be required to bring that violence to an end. And there is just no military solution that would work. And I think my evidence for that is that there are some people who hint that the President should ramp up military operations, but there's no real, coherent description of a military solution that anybody has really described. And I certainly don't mean that as a criticism of the gentleman that you cited; I mean that as an illustration of just how complex the situation is. And the President, at every turn, has put the interest of the United States first, and that's the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief.\nQ: But to his point on history not forgiving the President, is the President certain that history will see his side of things and his view of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think if we know anything about history, it's that historians tend to disagree about history, and I think this may be an area where historians do end up quibbling just a little bit.\nBut, again, I think the one thing that historians on both sides will acknowledge is the military solution that many people seem to wish for, including people with the best of intentions, simply does not exist. It has not been presented for any sort of public consideration.\nAnd diplomacy can be hard, it can be frustrating, it can take far longer than we would like. And I think there's probably no better illustration of diplomacy fitting that criteria that I just laid out then with regard to the situation in Syria. It has been hard, it's been frustrating, and it's taken far longer than we would like. But that's the only solution. That is the only way we can bring this violence to an end. It's the only way we can address the underlying chaos in Syria. And it's the only way we can expedite the provision of badly needed humanitarian assistance. And the United States has done more than anybody else to try to find that diplomatic solution, but we haven't found it yet.\nKenneth.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Leading up to the election, the President was quite vocal about President-elect Donald Trump's use of Twitter and how he communicated on Twitter. And you've said that the President -- it's his responsibility to look out for the interest of American people, look out for the American people and business. So is this White House and the President concerned about the President-elect targeting certain businesses, i.e. Boeing, or individuals, American citizens on Twitter, i.e. union leader of Carrier factory jobs that was in the news last week. Any concern? Any thoughts? Obviously, I'm sure you heard about the union leader being targeted this morning and the criticism there.\nMR. EARNEST: I've got lots of thoughts, and as tempting as it is, I'm going to refer questions about the Twitter handle of the President-elect to the President-elect's team.\nQ: Josh, also, back to DREAMers -- you were asked about it yesterday and again today -- but is there a message for those who came out of the shadows at the urging of this administration? Is there a message to those folks who are now nervous about what's going to happen after January 20th? I feel like the White House hasn't put out that message or spoken directly to those DREAMers who feel that the information that they've given to the government and coming out of the shadows is not in jeopardy.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kenneth, I think there are a couple things about this. The first is that the White House has been in close touch with a number of advocacy organizations, even in the aftermath of the election, to talk to them about the facts of immigration policy and to try to offer some reassurance. Certainly, the President and his transition team have gone to great lengths to describe and explain the policy that we have pursued to the incoming administration, so that when they begin the process of making some decisions about what our immigration policy should like, they can have the benefit of understanding exactly what our approach has been and what the benefits of that approach are.\nWe're also continuing to encourage Congress to take action. Ultimately, the kind of executive action that President Obama has pursued was largely pursued because of congressional inaction. We would much have preferred Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to capitalize on the obvious bipartisan ground that exists to implement common-sense immigration reform that would strengthen our economy, that would reduce the deficit, that would strengthen our borders, and ensure that we were treating fairly the hundreds of thousands of people in this country that are American in every way but their papers.\nAnd these are hundreds of thousands of people who were brought to the United States as children and have grown up in America, enmeshed in our communities, going to our schools, attending our churches, serving in our military.\nSo the President believes that we certainly are a nation of laws, a nation of laws that should be enforced, but we're also a nation of immigrants, and our policy should reflect that as well.\nQ: And finally, when the President told CNN that the strength of ISIL, or ISIS, \"wasn't on his intelligence radar,\" was he faulting the intelligence that he was getting or the failure of the intelligence?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm glad you asked. I know that some have perceived it that way, but the fact is, back in September of 2014, the Director of the Office of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, told David Ignatius, a writer for the Washington Post \"in this case we underestimated ISIL, and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army.\" He continued, \"I didn't see the collapse of the Iraqi security force in the North coming. I didn't see that.\"\nSo the President's comments to Fareed Zakaria for that documentary are consistent with the comments that you heard from the Director of National Intelligence more than two years ago about how difficult it would have been to accurately predict the effectiveness of ISIL on the battlefield and the ineffectiveness of an Iraqi security force that essentially had been hollowed out by the corruption and failed leadership of Prime Minister Maliki.\nThose are the facts the President discussed in that interview, not for the first time.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, I have sort of a straightforward question. I know we had this week at MacDill Air Force Base a speech framing the President's record on counterterrorism, lessons learned, et cetera. Does he envision a sort of more expansive farewell speech talking about lessons learned and what his legacy ought to be?\nMR. EARNEST: There certainly is a possibility of that, so stay tuned.\nQ: After the holidays, maybe?\nMR. EARNEST: Not before the holidays.\nQ: Not before the holidays, okay. Well, that's comforting.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, good.\nMichelle.\nQ: We've had a lot to say so far about the Pruitt appointment, and you made those environmental points. But we've also seen Donald Trump meeting with Al Gore, most recently Leonardo DiCaprio, and apparently he's had these long wonderful conversations with President Obama. So what would you say your confidence level is that the environment will be a priority? How would you sort of describe your view of, I don't know, I guess what these signals mean?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. Well, clearly the signals are mixed. I would assume that the kinds of conversations that the President-elect had with the Nobel prize-winning former Vice President were different than the kinds of conversations he had with the attorney general of Oklahoma who has been working hand-in-glove with the energy industry to call into question the science of climate change and to fight in a court of law, tooth and nail, against the kind of common-sense rules that we've put forward that have strengthened our economy and improved the health of our planet.\nBut how all of that comes out in the wash, so to speak, I think is something we'll all be watching over the next couple of years. But hopefully the metrics that I laid out earlier can be useful to all of you as you measure the results of the policy that the next administration chooses to pursue.\nQ: Okay. And Vice President Biden today, talking about the campaigns, called them ugly, coarse, dispiriting, a battle of personalities not of ideas, and he said that he was embarrassed by it. What does the administration think of those comments? And do you agree with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you heard me say on many occasions, you certainly heard the President say on a number of occasions how concerned and even disturbed at various points many Americans were by the rhetoric and tone of the election. There was a willingness to engage in some rather cynical tactics that was dispiriting.\nBut the election is over, the American people have decided. They cast more votes for Hillary Clinton but they elected Donald Trump President of the United States. And the time for that debate has ended, and the institutional responsibilities of the executive branch require all of us, including the President setting aside his political preferences and focusing on the responsibility that he has to ensure a smooth and effective transition to the incoming President.\nQ: Do you think the President agrees with Vice President Biden that this was embarrassing?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there are plenty of times where I think all Americans, certainly a large number of Americans, were disturbed by what they saw. But our opportunity to have that debate has -- well, first of all, there was ample opportunity to have that debate, and I don't think there was any mystery in the minds of too many voters about who they were voting for, but they decided.\nQ: Okay. And we keep hearing more calls for briefings by -- members of Congress want to be briefed on that Russian intelligence on hacking. So what is the status of that?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that those kinds of briefings and the provision of that information continues on the part of the intelligence community to members of Congress who seek it out. They obviously have a direct responsibility to those congressional committees that are charged with providing oversight over certain elements of the executive branch, but there are other members of Congress who are interested in this issue who have also received briefings and information from the administration.\nWe're going to continue to cooperate with Congress, and there is some classified elements of this analysis that can be shared with some of those members. But if there are additional intelligence conclusions that can be released, I wouldn't rule out future releases -- public releases of information about this matter either.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Yesterday, the Russian government completed the sale of a stake of its largest oil producer, Rosneft, to Qatar and to Glencore. And there are some who are watching this deal, saying that this $11 billion deal is a way that Putin has been able to get around sanctions. Do you believe that this sale violated the sanctions (inaudible)?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the thing that I -- there's not much that I can say about an individual financial transaction, even one as large and as significant as this one. The thing I can confirm for you is that the experts at the Department of Treasury that are responsible for constructing and enforcing the sanctions regime will carefully look at a transaction like this. They'll look at the terms of the deal and evaluate what impact sanctions would have on it. But how all that shakes out is something that you should ask the Treasury Department about.\nQ: And a question on Yemen. Human Rights Watch just put out a report saying that a couple of the airstrikes in Yemen in September and October by the Saudi-led coalition killed dozens of civilians, and the weapons that were used were American weapons that were given to the Saudi-led coalition after the conflict started. And the report, it says that these new findings put the U.S. at risk of complicity and unlawful attacks. Do you have a reaction to that report?\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse, I'd say something similar to what we said before, because we've heard reports like this in the past. And the U.S. review of assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is ongoing, and the United States continues to have grave concerns about coalition strikes that have resulted in civilian casualties.\nEven as the United States assists Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of its territorial integrity, we will continue to press the Saudi-led coalition to remediate the flaws in its targeting cycle and take other immediate steps to mitigate against future civilian casualties. We've spoken out about our concerns in the past, and we'll continue to do so moving forward, even as we review the kind of assistance that we provide to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\nQ: And one more on life expectancy in the U.S. There was a report that said that for the first time since 1993, life expectancy has declined, or declined in 2015. I know you usually talk about all the ways that the economy and the U.S. political system has improved since 2008. What's your reaction to the fact that life expectancy seems to have gone down at least slightly from last year?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that analysis, but why don't we take a look and see if we can get somebody to follow up with you.\nQ: And sorry, one more.\nMR. EARNEST: That's okay. I didn't really answer that one, so -- (laughter) --\nQ: Donald Trump is going to Louisiana to stump for the Senate candidate down there. There's going to be a Senate race; it concludes on Saturday. There has been some concern that Democrats don't seem to be -- at least national Democrats don't seem to be rallying behind the candidate down there. Is the President aware of this race? Is he involved in any way? Does he have any reaction to how national Democrats aren't engaging in that race?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, Louisiana has a peculiar election system that results in these kinds of runoffs occurring quite frequently. And it's a process that results in a pretty important election, like the one that they're expecting to hold here this coming weekend, taking place just a few weeks after a national election that captured everybody's attention.\nSo this is not the first time that there's been a discussion about whether one national party or the other is giving short shrifts to the outcome of a runoff in Louisiana. I'll admit that I've been a little busy here lately and I haven't been following the contours of the race, but, look -- so I don't know to what extent President Obama has weighed in or supported a candidate. I know that there are some Democrats across the country that have been supportive of the candidate down there, but I can't speak to anything that the President has done.\nGardiner.\nQ: Just quickly, Josh, when is the President going to sign the 21st Century Cures Act in a ceremony? Can you give us any hints about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't at this point. I don't know that we've actually even received the bill at this point. Sometimes it takes a little while to work its way through the bureaucracy of Congress and arrive on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. But the President does intend to sign the bill. He was obviously pleased to see a rare moment -- a rare bipartisan display that resulted in the passage of this bill that will increase funding for those fighting opioid addiction and increase funding for the cancer moonshot that the Vice President has been tasked with leading over the last year or so.\nSo obviously that's good news. But I don't have any update on the President's schedule in terms of how he'll sign it, but I can assure you that he will.\nJohn.\nQ: Specific issues that kind of have this CR stalled right now -- the big one looks to be the coalminers' health benefits. Where does the President stand? Does he stand with Senate Democrats who emerged from a meeting and said they're united on that issue?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm glad you asked about this. The truth is, it's quite cynical that Republicans in the Congress would adopt a position of only extending these benefits for the five-month life of the CR. These are lives and livelihoods that hang in the balance. And there should be bipartisan common ground to address the needs of these 20,000 coalminers who are slated to lose their health insurance at the end of the month.\nSo Democrats are ready to solve this problem, and it's not lost on me the irony that Republicans are bragging about the kind of support they have from workers in coal country, particularly retirees in coal country, and now are prepared to just extend their health care for five months. So we'll have to see exactly whether or not that's something that Republicans in Congress can fix before they send the bill to the White House.\nThere's one other aspect of the CR that you've heard me talk about before, but I think it merits repeating. When the problems with the water supply in Flint, Michigan first became public, there was a hue and cry among Republicans on Capitol Hill about how the federal government had let down the people of Flint, Michigan. The study, commissioned by the governor of Michigan, tells a somewhat different story. The cause of this problem notwithstanding, there has been a robust response from the Obama administration to work closely with the Republican governor of Michigan, to work closely with the community in Flint to expedite relief and response resources to the community.\nSo you had FEMA passing out millions of bottles of water. You had the Department of Health and Human Services standing up new operations so that additional health care could be provided to kids in that community that could be affected. There were other community development resources that were mobilized to try to support the community that was going through this crisis.\nThe Obama administration even expedited some of the previously approved funding from Congress to address some of the more immediate infrastructure concerns of the community. But all along, we've said that Republicans in Congress have a responsibility to do more about this problem than falsely accuse the federal government of malfeasance. They've got a responsibility to try to solve the problem. And there is a role for the United States Congress to play in terms of appropriating necessary resources to the community of Flint so that they can fix their water system, so that the children of that community are not drinking poisoned water.\nFinally, in the fall, we did see a promise from Republicans that they would act on this. But according to what you read in the newspapers -- well, let me just clarify one thing. They, in the fall, promised to act on this before the end of the year. But what we're seeing is that Republicans in Congress are actually planning to leave town for the year tomorrow. And hopefully they're not going to do that without fulfilling their promise to the people of Flint that have already endured so much and are just asking the United States Congress to do something other than falsely criticize their political opponents on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\nQ: Is the President prepared to take a stand on one or either issue to shut this thing down tomorrow night, to force Republicans to act?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is our steadfast hope that it's not going to come to that, and that the kind of cynicism that Republicans have displayed with regard to coalminers and the cynicism that they have displayed when it comes to playing politics with trying to solve the problems in Flint -- maybe a little of the holiday spirit will encroach. Maybe it will even happen at the congressional ball tonight. Maybe getting all gussied up in the tuxedos and the gowns will remind those Republicans of the responsibility that they have to look out for the interests of working people while they're here in Washington. We'll see.\nQ: Last one. Are things stalled or dire enough that it might be Biden time? Might be time to send the Vice President up?\nMR. EARNEST: To borrow a phrase? Look, I know that the Vice President of the United States has certainly, time and time again, over his four-decade career in Washington, D.C. and his eight-year record as Vice President of the United States, weighed in to try to get Congress to look out for the interests of working people. I don't know if that will be required this time, but I know he stands ready to serve if he's called.\nOkay, thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nQ: Josh, anything on the defense policy bill that was just passed?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything on that, but we'll follow up with you.\nQ: Josh, anything else on the schedule today? All you've got on the schedule is the Congressional Ball. What's he working on today?\nMR. EARNEST: Just a couple of meetings with staff today. But other than that, just spending time with members of Congress.\nQ: If Hillary Clinton comes, will you tell us?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. (Laughter.)\nHave a good day, everybody.\nEND 1:44 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-12-08", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

The Joint Declaration issued by President Obama and Mexican President Peсa Nieto in July 2016 detailed that the High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) has been a critical part of our strategy and is valuable mechanism to advance our countries' strategic economic and trade priorities, and as an instrument of cooperation on regional priorities. Since created in 2013, the HLED has been co-chaired by Vice President Joe Biden and Mexico's Secretary of Finance and Public Credit. Under the HLED, our two governments have engaged on a broad range of economic and commercial issues including energy, modern borders, workforce development, entrepreneurship and innovation, regulatory cooperation, and regional and global leadership, making life better for the people in both our countries.\nHLED achievements include:\nModern Borders\n•      We have modernized our shared border with innovative infrastructure such as: the Cross Border Xpress, a pedestrian footbridge linking San Diego and the Tijuana Airport; the Brownsville-Matamoros West Rail Bypass; the Tornillo-Guadalupe International Bridge; and the Pedestrian West Facility at the San Ysidro-El Chaparral Port of Entry.\n•      We are working toward an agreement on common principles to improve coordination on border crossing infrastructure priorities. The United States is developing a reference guide that will help identify innovative funding and financing options to improve U.S. border infrastructure.\n•      We have modernized customs and trade facilitation procedures through mutual recognition of certified trusted trader companies and the implementation of cargo pre-inspection pilots. We have raised enrollment in our individual country's trusted traveler programs—Global Entry and Viajero Confiable— to nearly five million.\n•      Since the new air services agreement entered into force in August, new passenger and cargo routes between our countries were added with more new routes expected, benefiting travelers and businesses.\n•      The Freight and Passenger Scenario Flow Study, conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation through the Federal Highway Administration, will be released in 2017. This will be an additional tool for both countries, as well as the private sector, to support freight and passenger infrastructure planning.\nEnergy\n•      We established the U.S.-Mexico Energy Business Council, which will meet on December 15-16 to deepen energy cooperation through dialogue with industry.\n•      We developed an integrated trilateral energy information platform, as a sharing mechanism for publicly available energy information, data and statistics, including updates on the North American mapping system.\n•      The first U.S. Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) was published in 2015, focusing on energy infrastructure. Mexico provided technical input on a North America chapter. The second QER, scheduled to be completed in December 2016, will focus on the U.S. electric system and include further analysis on North American integration. Mexico's energy reform and the implementation of proactive domestic policies and programs in both countries opened further opportunities for increased electricity integration, as well as through pipeline transport of natural gas and oil products.\n•      We have strengthened our energy and environmental cooperation by implementing the Agreement concerning Trans-boundary Hydrocarbon Reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico by signing three Memoranda of Understanding and two Letters of Intent, to promote sustainable and transparent development of energy resources and deepen cooperation on safety and environmental best practices and experiences related to offshore hydrocarbon resources.\n•      We have successfully concluded negotiations of an Agreement for Cooperation Concerning the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (\"123\" agreement) following a commitment made by the two Presidents in July. When brought into force, the Agreement would strengthen our legal framework for exports related to nuclear power reactors, major reactor components, and nuclear power reactor fuel, thereby enhancing potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the power sector.\nWorkforce Development\n•      We have strengthened our partnership in education through the Bilateral Forum on Higher Education, Innovation, and Research (FOBESII) to develop a modern workforce for the 21st Century, having signed over 100 agreements between U.S. and Mexican colleges and universities, increasing cross-border enrollment and facilitating student and teacher exchanges.\nEntrepreneurship and Innovation\n•      Recognizing entrepreneurship and innovation as central to our economic growth, under the auspices of the U.S.-Mexico Entrepreneurship and Innovation Council (MUSEIC) umbrella, Mexico developed its national cluster map – which was published in July 2016. Together, with the U.S. cluster map, individuals, businesses, and governments can identify investment and trade opportunities and design economic development strategies.\n•      Through the Americas Competitiveness Exchange, we convened businesses, economic development organizations and academics to learn about innovative approaches to economic development and to visit innovation hubs, businesses, and educational and research institutions.\n•      We are working together to promote women's entrepreneurship and women's full integration into the regional economy.\nRegional and Global Leadership\n•      We are promoting transparency, citizen participation, and strengthening governance through the Open Government Partnership.\n•      In addition, we are strengthening transparency in public procurement processes through the implementation of open procurement standards based on the publication of information in open data formats, and harnessing the potential of open data through the creation of specific tools that will help us with an effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\n•      Mexico is leading efforts to coordinate regional electricity and natural gas integration with Central America which supports regional clean energy generation and will help boost economic development.\nStakeholder Engagement\n•      Since the establishment of the HLED, both governments prioritized enhancing and expanding engagement with relevant stakeholders. Private sector representatives' participation in the U.S. – Mexico CEO Dialogue has provided an avenue for stakeholders to have a positive impact on HLED initiatives.\nThe Future\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness, which will bring tangible benefits to the citizens of both countries. We will also continue to broaden outreach to both U.S. and Mexican stakeholders in particular, the private sector, including civil society and academia to advance our strategic shared interests.\nFor more information on the High Level Economic Dialogue's accomplishments, go to:\n•      The Joint Statement of 2015 (English and Spanish)\n•      The Joint Statement of 2016 (English and Spanish)\n•      The Joint Declaration of 2016 (English and Spanish)", "timestamp": "2016-12-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: High Level Economic Dialogue: Three Years of Achievements"}

This revised plan supersedes the original plan issued on November 29, 2016. Title 5, United States Code, authorizes me to implement alternative pay plans for pay increases for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of \"national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,\" I view the adjustments that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate.\nCivilian Federal employees made significant sacrifices as a result of the 3-year pay freeze that ended in January 2014. Since the pay freeze ended, annual adjustments for civilian Federal employees have also been lower than private sector pay increases and statutory formulas for adjustments to the General Schedule for 2014 through 2016. However, keeping our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course requires tough choices.\nUnder current law, locality pay increases averaging 28.49 percent and costing $26 billion would go into effect in January 2017. Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases. In my August 31, 2016, submission of an alternative plan for base pay increases, I stated that the alternative plan for locality payments would be limited so that the total combined cost of the 1.0 percent across-the-board base pay increase and the varying locality pay increases would be 1.6 percent of basic payroll, consistent with the assumption in my 2017 Budget. However, in light of the decision of Congress to provide a 2.1 percent pay increase for military personnel in 2017 and reconsideration of current and projected economic conditions, I have concluded it would be appropriate to revise my original alternative plan for locality payments so that the total combined cost of the 1.0 percent across-the-board base pay increase and varying locality payments will be 2.1 percent of basic payroll. Thus, under the revised alternative plan, the varying locality pay increases will generate costs of 1.1 percent of basic payroll.\nAccordingly, I have determined that under the authority of section 5304a of title 5, United States Code, locality-based comparability payments for the locality pay areas established by the President's Pay Agent, in the amounts set forth in the attached table, shall become effective on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

This perspective gives him a different set of qualifications than the typical Washington insider.

He has always led CKE as an entrepreneurial company maintaining a focus on hard work and motivation instead of bureaucracy and red tape. Andy is someone who understands workers, their motivation, and what employees need in terms of job fulfillment and opportunities. Andy's leadership has provided growth opportunities for me and many others within our organization, and I know he will be steadfast in promoting the welfare and success of all hard working American citizens in this new role.\"\nTroi Wierdsma, Carl's Jr. Owner in San Francisco\n\"Andy Puzder's nomination as Secretary of Labor has given me even more faith in President-elect Trump's commitment to leading America back to prosperity. I have seen numerous positive character traits in Andy while working with him at Carl's Jr as a restaurant owner and franchisee for the past 13 years: he is solid on his word, sincere in his approach, and very driven to overcome whatever challenges may come his way. He sincerely cares as much about our cashiers as he does about the restaurant owners. His desire for fairness, his foresight, and his vision will help make nationwide economic prosperity an achievable destination. His work ethic has been an inspiration to all of us who have worked alongside of him, and it has been a pleasure to learn from the best of the best. I know he is going to do an outstanding job as President-elect Trump's Secretary of Labor.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Praise for President-Elect Donald J.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for corrections, marked with asterisks.\n1:16 P.M. EST\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. I apologize profusely for being so late. But I will try to move through this swiftly, so you all can get started on your weekends.\nDarlene, I don't have anything at the top. You're welcome to lead us off.\nQ: Thank you. Can you speak to what prompted the President to order this review on the Russian hacking into the presidential elections?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, Darlene. And we should just clarify that the President, earlier this week, instructed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of the pattern of malicious cyber activity related to our presidential election cycle. So he's requested this report be completed and submitted to him before the end of his term.\nAs you all know, in 2008, there were intrusions into both the Obama and McCain campaigns. There haven't been any noted episodes in 2012, but the President asked to go back, with what we know now, to make sure that we're using every tool possible as a means of due diligence. And then, of course, in 2016, our intelligence community determined that there was malicious cyber activity intended to interfere with our elections. In the high confidence assessment that was released this past October, the intelligence community made very clear that this was activity directed by the highest levels of the Russian government.\nSo as we've made clear, we are committed to ensuring the integrity of our elections. And this report will dig into this pattern of malicious cyber activity timed to our elections, take stock of our defensive capabilities, and capture lessons learned to make sure that we brief members of Congress and stakeholders, as appropriate.\nQ: Will the review go all the way back to '08?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So we're going to actually -- what the President asked for is a review to look at malicious activity timed to our presidential election cycle. And so it will be broader than just looking at this past election.\nQ: Will it also look at whether state election systems were tampered with, or will it just be about email intrusions?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, what we determined in mid-November, a few weeks ago now, is that state election systems did not -- the federal government did not detect any increased malicious cyber activity on Election Day or related to the administering of the elections. So we've already made that determination, and that's something we've announced publicly from here. But in terms of what this review will look at, this is going to be a review that's conducted by the intelligence community.\nAs you know, in that October statement that we released, that was released by the *Department[Office of the Director] of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security. Obviously there's other agencies that work on those issues, including the FBI, the Department of Justice and Department of State.\nQ: Will it be made public?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So we're going to make public as much as we can. Obviously, you can imagine a report like this is going to contain highly sensitive and even classified information, perhaps, so when that report is submitted we're going to take a look. We want to make sure we brief Congress and relevant stakeholders, like possibly state administrators who actually operationalize the elections.\nSo given that the directive to launch this review was just this week, we want to make sure that that process unfolds in all due accord.\nQ: And quickly on one other subject. Can you go into what guidance the White House may be giving to departments and agencies in the event there's a shutdown tonight?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can, Darlene. And we should just take a step back and remember that the fact that we're even talking about this is an indication of the failure of Republicans to govern. They come to Washington -- they hold majorities in both houses of Congress, and they come to Washington with a basic responsibility, and at that top of that list is funding the government. And the fact that we're in the 11th hour here and you even have to ask that question is an indication that Republicans have failed to fulfil their basic responsibility of governing.\nSo given that today is the deadline to keep the government open, we're obviously expecting and hope for them to pass a continuing resolution. We understand that there's conversations ongoing on the Hill about the path forward here. There's been concerns raised by Democrats about a couple of provisions; we echo those concerns. Josh talked about them earlier this week.\nThat includes not fully supporting retired coal miners who deserve benefits related to their health care and their pensions. These are coal miners who worked for decades in treacherous conditions and who earned these benefits. Unfortunately, the proposal that Republicans are floating only takes care of them for a few months. We believe that's not right. So, thankfully, Senator Manchin and Senator Brown are leading the effort here. I know those talks continue.\nAnother concern that we've raised -- that's been raised by Democrats on the Hill includes playing games with funding for Flint. We've heard forever now from Republicans who've demagogued that the federal government should be doing more to support the people of Flint, and we couldn't agree more. Republicans this fall committed to doing more to support the people of Flint. And unfortunately, the funding in the CR is tied to a bill that's completely unrelated and that has problems in it. So it's unclear whether that bill can even pass. So Republicans need to stop monkeying around with this and just get the job done.\nIn terms of the guidance that the Office of Management and Budget has released, I can tell you that, unfortunately, under a Republican-controlled Congress, they have too much practice releasing guidance about government shutdowns. And they've been in touch with agencies across the administration, across the government, planning for a number of contingencies.\nAyesha.\nQ: Hi. So South Korean lawmakers voted overwhelmingly today to impeach President Park. I was wondering, does the White House have any response to that or any response to these latest developments?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, we are following developments in the Republic of Korea closely. It's worth noting that this has been a time of political unease and change. And despite that, South Koreans have acted peacefully, calmly, and in respect for their own democratic principles.\nThe United States continues to be a steadfast ally, friend and partner to the Republic of Korea. And we look forward to working closely with *President[Prime Minister] Hwang in his new capacity as Acting President. We've always said that our alliances are deeper than tied to any particular -- any singular leader in any country, but rather, our ties are based on long-shared values, goals and interests.\nWe got similar questions earlier this year when Prime Minister Cameron stepped down, that if that would alter the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. And the answer is, no, that we have a strong relationship with the people of -- with the Republic of Korea, and I wouldn't expect that to change.\nQ: And does the White House have a position on whether she should step down or go through the impeachment process?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, we have enough on our plate in domestic politics, so it's not going to be for us to weigh in on the domestic politics in Korea.\nQ: On another subject. There's been reports that President-elect Donald Trump will remain on as an executive producer for \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" And this morning, his advisor, Kellyanne Conway, compared the possibility of him staying on as executive producer of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" to President Obama's golfing. I was wondering, does the White House think those two are comparable? Do they think they're similar? And does the President have any thoughts on President-elect Trump remaining on as executive producer of this show?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So I will confess to you I have not asked the President about this today. I'm not quite sure that analogy holds any water. But, look, that's going to be a question for the President-elect's team and perhaps our friends at NBC to answer how that relationship will work.\nMichelle.\nQ: So you mentioned that this new review of Russian hacking activity will go back to 2008. Is that the main way that it differs from the FBI investigation that's already done?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I see. It's a good question. And the FBI investigation was looking at specific acts that we saw over the summer and fall of this year. So, as you know, they looked at the hacks at campaign committees like the DNC and other malicious cyber activity that we were detecting. At the time, they determined that this is activity that could have only been directed from the highest levels of the Russian government. So, yes, this is going to put that activity in a greater context. That's going to look at the pattern of this happening from foreign actors, dating all the way back to 2008.\nQ: Okay. And the response that's coming now from the foreign ministry in Russia is that they're saying many times they've asked Americans to provide full information but never had any response. Is that true? I mean, have you guys not wanted to have those conversations with Lavrov or others? Is it something you wanted to kind of keep to yourselves for now? What can you say about the handling of this with respect to Russia?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think to the contrary, Michelle. This isn't something we've tried to keep to ourselves. The President, himself, has made clear that this is activity that's unacceptable, that is outside the bounds of --\nQ: But in terms of, like, the greater detail that they said they were looking for.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm not aware of any sort of specific request that they've asked for. But the President has made clear his views on this, and that malicious cyber activity -- specifically malicious cyber activity timed to our elections has no place in the international community.\nUnfortunately, this activity is not new to Moscow. We've seen them do this for years, try and meddle in elections and engage in similar activities in Europe and across Asia. So they, unfortunately, have a long record of this. But the President has made clear to President Putin that this is unacceptable. But that's not the only channel of communication. I do know that Secretary Kerry has talked to his counterpart, and we have other national security officials who have made this clear to their counterparts in Moscow.\nQ: Okay. And will this include a look at any potential attempts or activity at local levels? Or this is only going to look at kind of a bigger or federal level?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think these agencies will have to take a look at what we saw in 2008, 2012, and 2016. So I think that this is going to be a deep dive, that this will be a review that is broad and deep at the same time. And so they're going to look at where the activity leads them to look at. In other words, again, like I mentioned, in 2012 there was no noted episode of this nature, but knowing what we know now, using the tools that we have now, we can go back and see if there was anything that was missed back then.\nQ: How is there going -- I mean, if this is going to be so broad and deep, as you said, going beyond what the FBI took a pretty long time to do, and going back to 2008, how is there time to do this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, it's a huge priority. This is a major priority for the President of the United States. He directed his intelligence community and national security officials to take this on. He expects that report to be issued to him before he leaves office. You're right, there's going to be a lot of work to be done. But like you've also said, there's already been a lot of work done about the episode this year in 2016. So what we want to do is put that into context over the past eight years to see if we can sort of develop patterns, take stock of where we are and make sure that we do have the right defensive capabilities in place.\nQ: So when you see the allegations from some members of Congress and others that there could be evidence that Russia was actually trying to influence the election in a particular way, will this also look at potential motivations and whether that meaning was there or not?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, we know that, again, in October when the intelligence community released their high confidence assessment --\nQ: Just real quick -- was it high confidence? Because I thought the statement was just confidence. And this is the first time I've heard high confidence.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Hans, I should double-check that, but I'm pretty sure it was high confidence.\nQ: I can read it to you.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Let us take this, because when I was briefed out here I was told it was high confidence. But maybe we should just sync up.\nQ: So in the breadth of it, will it also look at whether they tried to influence the election in a particular way? Is it safe to say that it would look at motivations?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I want to be clear here that this is not an effort to challenge the outcome of the election, that we have acknowledged who won the election. It wasn't the candidate that the President campaigned for. And so the President has actually gone out of his way to make sure that we are providing for a seamless transition of power. So we're not calling into question the election results. We are taking seriously our responsibility to protect the integrity of those elections.\nQ: But is it safe to say that it will look at motivations and goals as well as the technical side of what was done?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think in that assessment that was released in October, it made clear that this was an attempt to interfere in our elections. So whether or not they dig deeper into motives, I'm not sure that will be a part of this review, but there are some things we already know for sure.\nJustin.\nQ: I want to go back to Korea first. I'm wondering if you anticipate this having any impact on the implementation of the missile defense system that we've been trying to install there, and also, if you have any sort of reaction to the, I think, push for corporate reform in South Korea that seems to have been a kind of underpinning of, or at least partial underpinning of this impeachment effort.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, I don't have -- I haven't heard any internal conversations that this could change that agreement that was announced earlier this year between President Park's administration and ours. So I don't have anything to suggest that that agreement is going to be changing.\nObviously, in the wake of the political changes in the Republic of Korea, we are in close coordination -- in close contact with our counterparts there. So the President's belief is that our relationship with the people of Korea is solid and strong. And that's based on a number of things. One, it's our rich people-to-people ties. There's a large Korean population in America that is strong and vibrant. There are strong relationships with young people between the United States and the Republic of Korea, a lot of cultural exchange programs that we take seriously.\nObviously, Korea is a large trading partner, so we have vibrant economic ties. And lastly, obviously regional security, as you're suggesting. We work closely with Korea on our stabilization and security efforts in the Korean Peninsula, specifically in regards to the threat posed by North Korea.\nAnd the second question?\nQ: I think we got it all.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Oh, good. (Laughter.) Okay.\nQ: But I did want to go back to the CR briefly. You praised Senators Manchin and Brown. Obviously their tactic right now seems to be to force a government shutdown in hopes of getting a minor provision for the full year -- minor funding. And they've also -- I think there's this dispute over the California water issue that seems unresolved. So is the President willing to veto legislation over this? And do you support sort of the tactics that could lead to a government shutdown here, even if it's just a brief one over the weekend?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I haven't brought out my veto pen.\nQ: But you've got, like, I don't know, 10 hours at this point, right?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We do have 10 hours and, unfortunately, Republicans have run out the clock. There's no reason it had to come to this point. They've had majorities in both chambers and they've also known this deadline was coming. This wasn't something that should have caught them by surprise.\nSo we do support efforts to care for the minors. These are benefits that they've accumulated over decades of work, and so we do support efforts to try and restore the benefits that they deserve.\nQ: But you're not willing to threaten a veto and you're not willing to say that you think the government should shut down at this point?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, I know those conversations are ongoing. I know that it's bewildering to me why we even need to have conversations about this. I don't understand why Republicans are picking a fight over minors in coal country who've worked for decades in treacherous conditions and who have earned the exact benefits that Democrats want to provide to them.\nQ: Well, what about on the water provision? I guess, like that -- I mean, that's Democrats being unable to agree with each other about what to do.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I'm not sure we see it that way, Justin. The problem with the Flint provision is that Republicans aren't putting their money where their mouth is --\nQ: They passed funding for Flint. The problem is that the two senators from California, who are both Democrats, can't agree on what the water plan that is attached to the Flint bill should be.\nMR. SCHULTZ: So, in other words, we, for months, heard Republicans talk a lot about the people of Flint and the support they need. But when it comes time to actually funding the people of Flint and making sure they have the support and resources they need, we have to tie it to another totally unrelated bill that has problems in it that's passage is in question? Why can't we just do this by the books and play it straight, and get the people of Flint the funding they need?\nThere's $170 million worth of funding in there, but without specific authorization language, it's really unclear whether that funding can actually get to the people of Flint.\nQ: All right, last one. The Vice President is up in Canada. I'm wondering if you anticipate any movement during his trip on the softwood lumber dispute. And there was a petition filed a few weeks ago -- I don't think we've talked about it yet -- but whether you guys anticipate the Commerce Department taking up this issue --\nMR. SCHULTZ: If Josh was here, he'd have a pun. I don't have one. (Laughter.) But I can tell you that I haven't heard the Vice President make any news on this on his trip. And I haven't heard from the Commerce Department if they plan to take this up, so you might want to just check with them.\nTamara. Welcome back.\nQ: Thank you. It's good to be back. On the assessment that's being done, the review that's being done, is there an effort to get this done quickly, before the President leaves because the President-elect has said publically that he doesn't think Russia was involved or that there was a 400-pound man somewhere in a basement involved? Is there an effort to, like, get this out and on the record before the new administration comes in?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think the President wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously. And this is something that the President has been monitoring closely for all eight years now. We placed a huge premium on cybersecurity, and that's actually reflected in how we've done business over the past eight years. If you look at our budget that we released *last[this] year, we include significant resources for cybersecurity. Unfortunately, Congress hasn't done a thing about it.\nA more concrete data point would be look at how we've handled this past year. In the summer and fall, we noticed an increase in probing and scanning of state election systems. As a result, the President ordered his Department of Homeland Security to respond. And what we did is we stood up resources at the Department of Homeland Security, which engaged state offices around the country, nearly every state. And we deployed experts; we worked with them to bolster their defense systems; we shared best practices. And we convened conference calls and communications to share the latest information as we learned it.\nSo this is something the President has been focused on for a while. But, yes, in the wake of the election, in the wake of this pattern that we've seen fairly regularly in recent elections here at the presidential level in the United States, the President wanted to make sure that we were executing on an after-action look at what we've noticed over the past few years.\nQ: The President has spoken with some regularity it seems to the President-elect. Has he told President-elect Trump about his review? And was there any reaction?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Tamara, we have acknowledged that the President and President-elect have spoken. I think we're up to a handful of times. But what we don't do is we don't read out those conversations, in order to protect the President's ability to have confidential conversations with the President-elect.\nQ: And when stakeholders will be told about the results of this, would those stakeholders include people like Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I think we just announced that this review is going to be underway. So as soon as we have a rollout plan for when it's submitted, we'll let you know.\nJordan.\nQ: Eric, I want to ask you about another pending piece of legislation, which is the defense policy bill. The Senate passed it 24 hours ago. Will the President sign it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We did see its passage. As Josh said, it's a 3,000-page bill. So we are reviewing it. As we've said, there are some things we were relieved to see in it, like a lack of the budgetary gimmicks that have been a hallmark of Republican governing over the past few years. Those aren't in it. There's some concern we have, like the permission to restrict -- to prevent our ability to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nSo I don't have a new position for you at this time.\nQ: I mean -- I guess the last time you guys threatened a veto over the bill, but signed it anyway over the Gitmo provisions. Are we to read that you're just going to sign it again from --\nMR. SCHULTZ: You have an accurate recollection of modern history.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Hans.\nQ: I just want to follow up on what the review is going to encompass. Should we be thinking of it as something that's going to be looking at Russia, or follow the facts wherever they may lead if that includes other either state actors or non-state actors?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The latter. So, in other words --\nQ: So this isn't going to be a global review. It's looking more at vulnerabilities of U.S. election processes and then it will follow the facts wherever they go?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, in other words, the intrusion that I mentioned in 2008 was publicly attributed to the Chinese, not to the Russians. So, yes, we will be looking at all foreign actors and any attempt to interfere with the elections.\nQ: And that's state and non-state?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, we should check in with the agencies who are charged with actually conducting the review. But I don't think they're going to take a -- this isn't going to be a narrow dive, this is going to be a deep dive into this troubling pattern.\nQ: And the other side of that question is will you be looking at Russian influence or other non-state actor influences outside of U.S. elections? Because in your answer you mentioned Europe and Eurasia. Will you be -- will you follow this to say if they interfered in an election in Central America, South America? How far will it take you?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I know that the United States' government and other governments have acknowledged that Russia participates in these sort of activities around the world. I'm not sure that this particular review will look into those episodes around the world. So I can't really confirm that it will be included in this review.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. I want to ask you about something that happened in Germany. To loud applause, Chancellor Angela Merkel told her party members this week that Germany should ban full-face veils wherever legally possible. What does the White House have to say about that decision, considering the strong ties that the President and the Chancellor have had over the last eight years?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You're right, Kevin. The President -- I don't think there's a world leader that the President has worked closer with than Chancellor Merkel. They most recently had an opportunity in Berlin a few weeks ago now. You were with us. And they've worked together on everything from national security to the refugee crisis, to climate change, to the Iran deal. And they have a very close working relationship.\nI think it's significant that on the President's final foreign trip, he went out of his way literally to go to Germany as a way to, A, express gratitude for the Chancellor's hard work on a whole host of issue; and B, as a symbolic gesture that the relationship between the United States and Germany is as strong as it's ever been, and because of that cooperation we've been able to accomplish great things over the past eight years. So the President, when he travels to countries like Germany, continues to speak out on democratic values.\nI don't know if we have issued a position on this. I did see those reports from Germany. But again, the President's views on this are clear, that in this country we have a strong tradition of freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and so the President frequently will speak out on those obviously when he's here at home, but also when he's abroad.\nQ: On the CR -- and I don't want to make more of this than has already been mentioned in the room, but I'm just curious -- if you're a senior, if you are -- it can be something as simple as going to the Army-Navy game, and you're wondering what happens if this doesn't get wrapped up. What's your message to the folks who are watching at home and wondering? They're not awash in this sort of policy on a day-to-day basis. They see the headline, and many of them are obviously concerned.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'll get very specific. So if it is apparent late Friday evening or early Saturday that a new CR is likely to be enacted on Saturday, our Office of Management and Budget will instruct agencies to operate at a normal manner and not engage in a shutdown procedure.\nIf OMB determines late Friday or early Saturday that a CR is not likely to be enacted, we will issue instructions for agencies to proceed with their shutdown implementation. That includes the orderly shutdown by non-exempted employees. And agencies will need to work through their own furlough issues for days that are traditionally open for the federal government. I know it falls over the weekend, so we'll be looking at that.\nBut, look, individual agencies are required to have updated shutdown plans that outline activities that will take place during the shutdown. So if you have specific questions about what will be open and what wouldn't be open you should check in with those agencies.\nThank you.\nKenneth.\nQ: Hey, Eric. To go back to the review for one more question. If the goal is to obviously figure out if there was an attempt to interfere with the elections and past elections and share that with stakeholders, with Congress. Obviously we're talking about this broad review that's going to be pretty in-depth. Is there a concern that the next administration -- is the goal for the next administration to take some action as well, since the President only has 40 days left? And if so, is there a concern that the next administration -- President-elect Donald Trump, President-elect Trump won't act on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, in terms of what the next administration will do, it's hard for me to speculate on that. So I'd refer you to the President-elect's team. I do think -- this exact issue surfaced a little bit earlier this week when -- well, maybe it was Friday -- when the President's Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity released its report, which was a deep dive unrelated to the election, but looking at cybersecurity infrastructure around the United States. And there were some pieces in there that were actionable that we could probably work on and improve over the next 40-45 days while the President is still in office. But there's a whole host of recommendations in that report that will not be able to be implemented in the next 45 days.\nSo this is going to be a challenge. I don't think it's a controversial statement to say this will be a challenge for the next administration and the next Congress. We hope that Congress puts a little bit more muscle into funding a lot of the requests for better resources and better support. But, yes, this will be a problem that outlives this administration. And I do think that the report that was released Friday and presumably the report that gets turned in based on this review can provide a road map for future administrations to tackle this.\nQ: And, Eric, I don't think I heard you say -- and forgive me if you did -- has the President reached out to Senate leadership on the CR, or any senators who have -- like Senator Manchin who's had a stake in this with fighting for coal miners -- has there been some type of communication?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any presidential conversations to read out to you. I can confirm there were about 300 to 400 members of Congress here last night for the congressional balls, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were conversations in the photo line or elsewhere in the East Wing on this. But I can assure you that members of Congress know precisely where we stand. I know our Office of Legislative Affairs is in touch with both Democrats and Republicans on this. So there shouldn't be any question as to our position.\nQ: And, Eric, also -- so the President-elect's Labor Secretary is a vocal critic of many of the President's initiatives -- so raising the minimum wage, expanding overtime pay eligibility. He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So what impact do you think he'll have on workers, on labor? Is there a concern there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, I'm not going to be in a position to speculate on what the incoming President's team -- what policies they will implement and the results of those policies. We can only just speak for ourselves. And I think the record that we've produced is one to be proud of, and it's one, I think, that the next administration will be judged against. Hopefully, it's one that future administrations for some time will be judged against.\nAs you recall, when we took office, the unemployment rate was at 10 percent. Governor Romney famously said that he could bring it down to 6 percent. We actually hit that earlier than expected, and right now it's at 4.6 percent. So we feel good about our record, which, again, includes the longest stretch of private sector job growth on record. Businesses have added 15.6 million jobs over the last 81 months. And so wages have started to accelerate in recent years. So we feel good about the progress we've made.\nI'll give you one example of something specifically that we've worked on. In the 2015 State of the Union, the President called for an increase in the minimum wage. Congress has not lifted a finger to do that under Republican direction, but some states have and some private companies have, and some localities have. I believe we're now up to 18 states and the District of Columbia which have raised the minimum wage. My colleagues at the Council of Economic Advisers released a report a few days ago that looked at the impact of raising the minimum wage in those states. They found that wages went up, and they found that there was no adverse impact on business interests.\nSo that's an argument that we frequently hear from Republicans. Maybe under the next administration they can take more direct action to increase wages, because that's something we've been focused on. Unfortunately, we've had a recalcitrant Congress refusing to do so.\nQ: And finally, has the President had a chance to reach out to the family of John Glenn?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kenneth, I don't have any calls on that to read out to you. As you saw, we released a statement yesterday from the President. I think it's clear that Senator Glenn is someone who enjoyed the admiration, and captured the imagination, of the American people. He's an American hero and a true public servant. He's a decorated Marine Corps pilot from World War II in Korea. He was the first American to orbit the Earth. And he served in the United States with unimpeachable integrity. He's someone who fought for science and technology. He was a thought leader on these issues, and not just while he was in the Senate, but for years after.\nSo our thoughts and prayers are with his family. POTUS was proud to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. And we thank him and his family for their service.\nMark.\nQ: Yeah, Eric, one more on the hacking. To what degree -- or is this at all a response to the Senate Democrats who wrote you I guess earlier this week and -- the ones who say, look, we need more evidence to back up this general assertion that we've had, and that you would then -- so how much of this review is to decide what can actually be made public to bolster the argument that the intelligence community has made?\nMR. SCHULTZ: None. So that will be a separate process. So as we've acknowledged here, we've received a request from members of Congress for briefings on this. And I think as Josh made clear yesterday, we have been briefing them on this. There are certain committees with unique jurisdiction on these issues, so we make sure we brief them. Some of that has been classified briefings; some have been unclassified. But we're also in touch with all members of Congress, because we know there's wide interest on this.\nSo we're happy to conduct those briefings. We're also happy to go through the process to figure out if there can be more material that is unclassified in response to those requests. But this review is unrelated to requests by Congress. This is something the President directed his national security team to conduct.\nQ: Okay. Can I also you about the climate resilience area that the President has just declared? What's the rationale behind it? And is this, as some Republicans have been warning us about, the beginning of a raft of environmental rules that you're going to close out and rush before the inauguration?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mark, as you point out, this was something released, I believe, a short while ago; announced in Alaska. And it's in response to requests we've gotten from indigenous people up there that the coastal tribes along the Northern Bering Sea and the Bering Strait requested that the federal government take this action to protect the health of marine ecosystems of the Northern Bering Sea while maintaining opportunities for sustainable fishing and sustainable economic development.\nSo this was the right decision to make. If you have more questions about it, we can get you the details. But the idea that this is a preview of additional actions to come, I wouldn't read that into it. Again, here, under this President's direction, we make decisions on the merits. And as the President as indicated, we're going to continue to do our job until January 20th. So I don't have any additional actions to preview.\nFred.\nQ: Thanks. I have a couple things I want to ask about. First of all, it's reported that President-elect Trump has asked -- or is picking Cathy McMorris Rodgers to be his Interior Secretary. The President -- she's part of the Republican leadership. The President has -- or the White House has worked with her in some capacity. I wondered if you had any thoughts of her in that particular role, given her voting record on environmental and energy issues.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Fred, I -- like we have generally done, I don't have a lot to say about the President-elect's team. Obviously, when you select a member of Congress, you have a long record that's attached to you. So I'm going to let others sort of dig deep into that record and what that might mean for policies that the next administration pursues.\nQ: And any thoughts on -- I mean, just from your experience and your knowledge on her record on some of these issues, aside from the Cabinet position.\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's a fair question. The posture that we've taken here, though, is that Donald Trump was elected President on November 8th, and it's not the candidate that the President campaigned for. It's not the candidate who offered policies the President agrees with. But in light of the election results, we're going to allow that president the respect he deserves in order to -- that President-elect the space he needs to put together his team.\nThat was not something afforded to this President. As you know, we faced fierce opposition on some of our nominees, even though they came to office -- they came to these positions with unimpeachable integrity and high qualifications. But the President feels strongly that our priority now needs to be allowing the President-elect to take office in about 40 days, and do so with a team that he selects.\nQ: On some other question -- I have asked before about possible executive actions. So just maybe get an update on this -- any (inaudible) or movement. A couple things that have been out there -- former President Carter has said that the President should take some type of executive action on possibly a Palestinian state, either through U.S. recognition or just not vetoing a U.N. resolution. Another issue that's been out there -- some House Democrats have -- they sent a letter, they've advocated using the pardon power for DREAMers. Has the President ruled either of those out?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Fred, on the former, I know that the former President Carter had an op-ed piece out today. I haven't had a chance to take a close look at it, but clearly he is someone who has strong views about that region. And so I don't think those views are new today, so I don't have any new positions or views from us on that.\nOn the ask from House Democrats, there is a process at the Department of Justice to review pardon applications. The President has said he is not going to do anything to circumvent that process. What he has done in recent years is bolster resources at the Department of Justice to make sure they are at maximum capacity to have all the bandwidth they need to review applications. So that process continues in earnest.\nI expect that process to continue for the rest of the time the President is office. But we're going to also respect that process at the Department of Justice.\nQ: You're not ruling out anything on Palestinian statehood, but you're saying no -- to the second question?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm saying that I don't have anything new to offer on that first issue that's a departure from our positions.\nJohn.\nQ: The last few times Congress has needed a CR and kind of taken it to the last hours, the President seems to have mostly stayed out of it. But as the countdown clock may appear on cable news shortly, as head of government, does he feel any responsibility at some point this afternoon, this evening, to get involved in the talk -- to try to find some resolution?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, I don't have any presidential conversations to read out at this point. I can say to you that it's quite clear whose responsibility this is; that if Republicans -- maybe if Republicans didn't control both chambers or maybe if they only controlled one, or maybe if they didn't control either, they could sort of shirk this. But I'm not sure that's going to hold water at this point.\nSo, yes, the President does want to avoid a government shutdown. That's a bedrock principle of this President over the past eight years. Unfortunately, Republicans haven't always shared that principle, so we'll have to see now if they want to dig in and have their support for coalminers questioned, whether they think this is a fight worth having. That's going to be a question they need to resolve.\nGoyal, I'll give you the last one, and then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: Thank you very much, a couple questions. One, many people, especially women around the globe, are wondering that America is not ready for a female President. Many countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Israel, even Liberia, and now UK and Germany. My question is that Madam Hillary Clinton wasn't elected to be the first female President. Is America ready for a female President? Or it's a man's world? People are asking around the globe.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Goyal, we should just remember that Secretary Clinton has made history several times. She was the first First Lady ever elected to the United States Senate in her own right. She was the first woman to be a nominee of a major party for the presidency. And so she's made an awful lot of history and she's broken a lot of barriers herself.\nAs we've said, November 8th she didn't get elected President of the United States. I quibble perhaps with the presumption in your question that America isn't ready for this when she got more votes than the Republican nominee. So she got about 2.5 million more votes than Donald Trump, but that isn't going to get you much when you don't win the Electoral College. So she came up short in this election.\nBut I think that there is going to be a lot of analysis about why that happened. But in terms of the inspiration that she provided women of all ages throughout her career and her lifetime of public service, I don't think that's in question at all.\nQ: As far as President-elect Trump is concerned, he also made history, and he is a household name around the globe. My question is that he comes from the business community, and I'm sure he's going to run America like a business. So where do we stand as far as the U.S.-India business future is concerned under President Trump? Because now under President Obama, we had great relations between the two countries as far as commerce, trade, and recently last week signed agreement with Boeing and other. India will be making some U.S. airplanes and fighter jets. But President Trump -- or elect-President Trump is saying that it might change. So where do we stand, the future of U.S.-India trade?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. Goyal, this might be disappointing, but it's not going to be surprising that I'm just not going to be in a position to weigh in on positions that the next President might take when they assume office. They'll have ample opportunity to express those and field your questions.\nI can speak to the relations between India and the United States under this administration. And they're as strong as ever. The President has worked closely with Prime Minister Modi on a whole host of issues, ranging from national security, to climate, to trade, to commerce, and to strong people-to-people ties. We have a rich history and shared values. The President is proud of that record. And the President is proud of the steps we've taken to increase the ties between our two countries over the past eight years.\nQ: And one more, if I may. Tomorrow is Human Rights Day -- or international, global Human Rights Day. And many women around the globe -- freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and blasphemy laws in the Saudi Arabia and in Pakistan. People are under attack. And especially in Saudi Arabia, women and in Pakistan, and the community of (inaudible), Hindis, and also minorities. So where do we stand? Any message from the President as far as universal Human Rights Day is concerned?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I know that's an important day. But the President speaks out about this throughout the calendar. And like we've discussed, the President believes strongly in human rights. He wants those adhered to strictly here in the United States. But he also hasn't been afraid to raise those issues around the world. Sometimes that's when he travels. Sometimes that's when he -- that's when we have foreign leaders here visiting in the United States.\nBut the President gave a speech earlier this week where in a different context he talked about freedom of press, freedom of expression, freedom to criticize your own leadership. Those are democratic values. But we think those are consistent with human rights that should be afforded to people around the world, that countries are stronger when they respect human rights, when they respect decency and values of their own people.\nQ: And as far as China -- as well as talking about China on human rights, they don't care. They are telling that don't preach us, don't give us any lecture on human rights.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. It's a good point, that the President raises this every time he is in China or meeting with his counterpart. And it's not only raised at the presidential level, but all counterparts -- everyone in this administration raises these issues. We did it most recently when we were in China. But I can't think of a single visit where the President didn't raise human rights in the context of our relationship with the Chinese.\nQ: Thanks, Eric.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good. I'll do the week ahead.\nOn Monday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\nOn Tuesday, the President will sign the 21st Century Cures Act. The President and Vice President will deliver remarks at this event.\nOn Wednesday, the President host two Hanukkah receptions here at the White House. The First Lady will attend both.\nAnd on Thursday, the President will be here at the White House for meetings.\nAnd on Friday, the President will depart the White House en route Honolulu, Hawaii for his final Hawaii holiday vacation while President of the United States.\nQ: When is the news conference?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Stay tuned.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: No.\nQ: Eric?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes.\nQ: You didn't give me a chance to counter about that Energy Department questionnaire the Trump transition team sent out. It seems like people who have worked on the President's climate change agenda were being asked certain questions about did they, in fact, work on it. Were you guys read in on this or briefed on this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kenneth, I saw some news reports on this before we came out. And for questions about the President-elect team's questioning of civil servants or targeting of civil servants, you should check in with the President-elect's team.\nAll I can tell you is that President Obama is enormously proud of the work of civil servants and federal workers across the administration; that over the past eight years, they've worked to make this country stronger. And they don't do so out of a sense of great pay or because the hours are great. They do so out of a sense of patriotism. And the President is proud of their record.\nQ: So no concern of employees being targeted?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, we just saw some news reports on this before heading out here. So if you have questions about activity that the President-elect's team is doing, you should check in with them and try and figure out why they're doing it.\nThanks.\nQ: And personally, I just want to thank the President and First Lady for the White House party invitation.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good. Thank you, Goyal.\nEND 2:06 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Press Briefing by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122457", "text": "WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the White House released a new capstone report with updates about projects launched and local progress made in response to the Administration's Rethink Discipline efforts. Rethink Discipline was launched as part of President Barack Obama's My Brothers' Keeper initiative and aims to support all students and promote a welcome and safe climate in schools. The full report is available HERE.\nThe White House will also convene stakeholders and leaders to discuss the progress made and the work ahead to encourage and support local leaders as they work to implement supportive school discipline practices. Today's meeting in the Roosevelt Room will include remarks by Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, Cabinet Secretary and Chair of the My Brother's Keeper Task Force Broderick Johnson, Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Muсoz and Secretary of Education John King.\nAs noted in a  joint Department of Education and Department Health and Human Services Policy Statement, suspension and expulsion can contribute to a number of adverse outcomes for childhood development in areas such as personal health, interactions with the criminal justice system, and education.\nThe 2013-14 Civil Rights Data Collection reveals that out-of-school suspensions decreased by nearly 20 percent compared to the 2011-12 school year. However, 2.8 million students received out-of-school suspensions in the 2013-14 school year, representing approximately 6% of all students enrolled in elementary and secondary schools.\nThe application of exclusionary discipline practices is especially significant for students of color and students with disabilities, who, in general, are disciplined more often than their classmates. As stated in the Department of Education's  First Look brief about 2013-14 CRDC data, in preschool, black children are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended than white children. In K-12, black students are 3.8 times more likely to receive one or more out-of-school suspensions compared to white students. Students with disabilities are more than twice as likely to receive one or more out-of-school suspensions as students without disabilities\nAddressing these disparities and rethinking discipline have remained top priorities of the Administration, which has focused attention on the importance of school disciplinary approaches that foster safe, supportive, and productive learning environments in which students can thrive.\nAnnouncements made as part of this comprehensive effort include:\n•      Supportive School Discipline Initiative: In 2011, the Departments of Education and Justice announced the launch of a collaborative project to support the use of school discipline practices that foster safe, supportive, and productive learning environments while keeping students in school. A cornerstone of this Initiative is the School Discipline Consensus Project, managed by the Council of State Governments and supported by various philanthropic organizations. The Consensus Project brought together practitioners from various fields to develop consensus recommendations to dismantle the \"school-to-prison pipeline.\"\n•      Joint Federal Policy and Legal Guidance: Education and Justice jointly released a School Climate and Discipline Guidance Package in 2014 to provide schools with a roadmap to reduce the usage of exclusionary discipline practices and clarify schools' civil rights obligation to not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin in the administration of school discipline.\n•      #RethinkDiscipline Convening and Public Awareness Campaign: The Departments of Education and Justice launched Rethink Discipline at the White House in July of 2015, convening school district teams, including superintendents, some law enforcement practitioners, and justice officials from across the country and sparking a national dialogue around punitive school discipline policies and practices that exclude students from classroom instruction and targeted supports.\n•      Rethink School Discipline - Resource Guide for Superintendent Action: As a part of Rethink Discipline, the Department of Education developed a resource guide with a set of potential action items to help school leaders implement safe, supportive school climate and discipline by engaging stakeholders, assessing the results and history of existing school climate and discipline systems and practices; implementing reform; and monitoring progress.\n•      Support for State and Local Educational Leaders and Partners from Other Systems: In 2015, the Department of Justice launched the National Resource Center for School Justice Partnerships to advance school discipline reform efforts and serve as a dynamic resource hub for schools, law enforcement agencies, and others to support school discipline reform efforts at the local level.\n•      Fostering Safe and Supportive Learning Environments: In 2016, the Department of Education released the ED School Climate Surveys and the Quick Guide on Making School Climate Improvements to help foster and sustain safe and more nurturing environments that are conducive to learning for all students.\n•      Addressing Implicit Bias and Discipline Disparities in Early Childhood Settings: In 2016, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services announced a new investment of $1 million in the Pyramid Equity Project to establish national models for addressing issues of implicit bias, and uneven implementation of discipline, including expulsions and suspensions, in early learning programs.\n•      Providing Guidance to Schools on Ensuring Equity and Providing Behavioral Supports to Students with Disabilities: In 2016, the Department of Education announced the release of a significant guidance document in the form of a Dear Colleague Letter, which emphasized the requirement that schools provide positive behavioral supports to students with disabilities who need them. It also clarified that the repeated use of disciplinary actions may suggest that many children with disabilities may not be receiving appropriate behavioral interventions and supports. Also included was a Summary for Stakeholders.\n•      Transforming School Climate: In the 2016 Investing in Innovation Program, the Department supports innovative approaches to creating a supporting school climate. This priority builds on the #RethinkDiscipline campaign to increase awareness about the detrimental impacts of exclusionary discipline, the Department's investment in School Climate Transformation Grants to help states and districts strengthen behavioral supports for students, and a school discipline guidance package to clarify schools' obligation not to discriminate on the basis of race in discipline.\n•      Best Practices and Procedures for School Resource Officers: In September of 2016, U.S. Departments of Education and U.S. Justice released new tools to assist states, districts and schools in the implementation of best practices for the appropriate use of school resource officers (SROs). The release is the result of collaborative work between both Departments to define the best use of law enforcement officers when utilized within a school environment. The Departments also jointly released the Safe, School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect (SECURe) Rubrics. These resources are designed to help education and law enforcement agencies that use SROs to review and, if necessary, revise SRO-related policies in alignment with common-sense action steps that can lead to improved school safety and better outcomes for students while safeguarding their civil rights.\n•      Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools: Last month, ED sent a letter urging state leaders to end the use of corporal punishment in schools, a practice repeatedly linked to harmful short-term and long-term outcomes for students. The letter from the Secretary was sent to governors and chief state school officers and provided links to resources that can be promoted by those state leaders and adopted by district and school leaders.", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Press Release - White House Report: The Continuing Need To Rethink Discipline"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122606", "text": "Since taking office, President Obama has worked to protect the Arctic's natural and cultural resources and the communities that rely upon them through the use of science-based decision making, enhanced coordination of Federal Arctic management, efforts to combat illegal fishing, and revitalization of the process for establishing new marine sanctuaries. Building on this effort, today, President Obama is announcing new steps to enhance the resilience of the Alaskan Arctic environment and the sustainability of Alaskan native communities with the creation of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area.\nIn addition to today's protections, the Obama Administration is announcing approximately $30 million in philanthropic commitments for projects in rural northern Alaska and Canada. These projects include investments over the next three years related to shipping, ecosystem science, community and ecological resilience, and tribal engagement. Earlier this week, the Department of Commerce deployed an Economic Development Assessment Team to Nome, Alaska to help the region diversify, grow its economy, and address challenges related to climate change and community resilience.\nToday's actions are also supportive of the March 2016 U.S.-Canada Joint Statement on Climate, Energy, and Arctic Leadership and make substantial progress on its objectives of conserving Arctic biodiversity through science-based decision-making, incorporating indigenous science and traditional knowledge into decision-making, and supporting strong Arctic communities. These actions employ science-based leadership to improve marine and coastal resilience and sustain our Nation's precious natural resources.\nExecutive Order Creating the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area\nNative villages in the northern Bering Sea region of Alaska largely practice a subsistence-based lifestyle that is inextricably tied to the rich marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea. Warming ocean temperatures, sea ice loss, and increasing ship traffic all threaten the subsistence practices and food security of these communities. The coastal tribes along the northern Bering Sea and the Bering Strait have requested that the Federal Government take action to protect the health of the marine ecosystems of the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait while maintaining opportunities for sustainable fishing and sustainable economic development.\nIn direct response to these requests, the President signed an Executive Order creating the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. This area, encompassing 112,300 square miles, represents a hugely productive, high-latitude ocean ecosystem and supports one of the largest seasonal marine mammal migrations in the world, including thousands of bowhead and beluga whales, hundreds of thousands of walruses and ice seals, and millions of migratory birds. It is home to more than 40 tribes of coastal Yup'ik and Inupiaq peoples whose way of life has been linked with the marine environment for thousands of years.\nThe Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area is delineated for the purpose of focusing a locally-tailored collection of protections related to oil and gas, shipping, and fishing. The order also establishes a Task Force charged with coordinating Federal activities in this area to enhance ecosystem and community resilience, conserve natural resources, and protect the cultural and subsistence values this ecosystem provides for Alaskan native communities. Further, agencies are directed to consider traditional knowledge in decision making and establish a formal consultative mechanism for engaging with regional tribal governments to seek their input on Federal activities. This action advances science-based decision-making and engagement with Alaska Native peoples in addressing the changing Arctic consistent with the Joint Statement signed at the White House Arctic Science Ministerial and consultation with Alaska Natives in preparation for the Ministerial.\nShipping\nIn recognition of the increase in shipping through the Bering Strait, the Coast Guard is nearing completion of a Port Access Route Study (PARS) for the region. A PARS is the first step in assessing the need for vessel traffic control measures and developing a set of recommendations. Any recommended international routing measures would be submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which sets international rules for maritime commerce. The Executive Order directs the Coast Guard to give careful consideration to community recommendations regarding environmentally sensitive Areas to Be Avoided (ATBAs) and to publish its initial findings by the end of 2016 and to move its conclusions to the International Maritime Organization for action by 2018.\nFishing\nSea bottom habitat is extremely important to the ecosystem in the Northern Bering Sea and helps to support the incredible abundance of marine mammals and sea birds in the region, including critical subsistence resources. In recognition of these connections, bottom trawling is already banned in the region to protect the sea floor. The Executive Order makes it Federal policy to support the continued prohibition on bottom trawling, which destroys sensitive benthic ecosystems.\nOil and Gas\nUnder the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the President has withdrawn Norton Basin planning area and portions of the St. Matthew-Hall planning area from future oil and gas leasing to further protect the regional ecosystem and coastal communities. The five year leasing plans issued by the Department of the Interior do not include plans for leasing in the withdrawn areas, so there will not need to be changes to those plans to reflect the withdrawal. The total area withdrawn from leasing through this Executive Order is 40,300 square miles.\nCoordination and Consultation\nThis Order also advances the Administration's priorities of elevating traditional knowledge in decision making and coordinating Federal efforts in the Arctic. Today's actions establish a Federal Task Force on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area (Bering Task Force), under the Arctic Executive Steering Committee (AESC) established by Executive Order 13689. The Bering Task Force will coordinate Federal activity and consider additional mechanisms to reduce impacts to subsistence and cultural activities within the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. The Executive Order also formally elevates the voice of Alaskan native tribes and the role of indigenous knowledge in decision-making within the region by mandating that the Task Force establish and engage in regular consultation with a Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council, which will consist primarily of tribal government representatives with participation from Federal, state, and local officials for coordination purposes. Together, these two groups will guide the incorporation of valuable traditional knowledge and science into Federal resource management in the northern Bering Sea region, thus preserving this unique ecosystem and the indigenous peoples who rely upon it.\nCommitments to Rural Northern Alaska and Canada\nToday, in support of the U.S.-Canada commitments to a Shared Arctic Leadership model, the philanthropic community is pledging approximately $30 million for projects in rural northern Alaska and Canada.\n•      The Arctic Funders Collaborative (AFC), a group of eleven U.S., Canadian and international philanthropic foundations, is announcing that a subset of its members will coordinate and mobilize resources through grant programs across the Arctic at a projected $27 million over the next three years in the following areas:\no      Community-led planning and monitoring initiatives that foster adaptation and resilience to a changing Arctic climate\no      Low-impact shipping corridors in Arctic Alaska and Canada, including routing and mitigation measures to help improve maritime safety and spill prevention\no      Northern-led policy development informed by indigenous knowledge and science\no      Fostering connections between Northern priorities and social finance institutions in ways that support culture, community resilience and sustainable economic opportunities\no      Building in-region capacity of indigenous-led organizations and emerging leaders across the Arctic\nPriority geographic areas for marine stewardship support include the northern Bering Sea and the Bering Strait, the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, the Northwest Passage, Lancaster Sound, Baffin Bay, the Davis Strait, and Hudson Bay.\n•      Today, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is announcing a $3.7 million grant to support research that couples state-of-the-art geophysical observations from unmanned aerial systems with a community-engaged research approach to bridge scientific and indigenous understanding of sea ice change in the Alaskan Arctic. Led by the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Columbia University, and Kotzebue residents, the project will research changing patterns of Arctic ice and other physical characteristics in Kotzebue Sound and the Chukchi Sea, using a combination of traditional knowledge and sensing technologies in modules carried by drones. From the beginning of the work - including development of the research design - the project will involve local experts who have sea ice experience and other environmental knowledge.", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces Actions to Protect Natural and Cultural Resources in Alaskan Arctic Ocean"}

Out of the ashes of the Second World War, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed that \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\" On Human Rights Day and during Human Rights Week, we reflect on how far we have come in upholding these universal rights and resolve to continue fighting to safeguard them wherever they are threatened.\nIn the last few decades, our world has made great strides in advancing human rights and the institutions that protect them. More countries have pursued self-government and democracy—and more people are electing their leaders freely and fairly and holding their governments accountable through calls for increased transparency. Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere.\nHistory ultimately moves in the direction of justice and inclusion, but despite the great progress we have made, unprecedented and rapid change has posed great challenges. It is our collective duty to continue striving for a world where nobody is left behind, forgotten, or mistreated, and where all nations recognize that societies that draw on the contributions of every citizen are stronger. Far too many people around the world are still denied their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we must work to end the discrimination that is too often felt by LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, immigrants, women and girls of all ages, and members of religious, ethnic, and other minorities. And we must strengthen our ongoing efforts to rid the world of violence, oppression, and hatred.\nOur relationships to one another—person to person, nation to nation—are defined not by our differences, but by our shared belief in the ideals enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This Executive order and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on December 14.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119867", "text": "By the authority vested in me as the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Purpose. As recognized in Executive Order 13689 of January 21, 2015, (Enhancing Coordination of National Efforts in the Arctic), Arctic environmental stewardship is in the national interest. In furtherance of this principle, and as articulated in the March 10, 2016, U.S.-Canada Joint Statement on Climate, Energy, and Arctic Leadership, the United States has resolved to confront the challenges of a changing Arctic by working to conserve Arctic biodiversity; support and engage Alaska Native tribes; incorporate traditional knowledge into decisionmaking; and build a sustainable Arctic economy that relies on the highest safety and environmental standards, including adherence to national climate goals. The United States is committed to achieving these goals in partnership with indigenous communities and through science-based decisionmaking. This order carries forth that vision in the northern Bering Sea region.\nThe Bering Sea and Bering Strait are home to numerous subsistence communities, rich indigenous cultures, and unique marine ecosystems, each of which plays an important role in maintaining regional resilience. The changing climate and rising average temperatures are reducing the occurrence of sea ice; changing the conditions for fishing, hunting, and subsistence whaling; and opening new navigable routes to increased ship traffic. The preservation of a healthy and resilient Bering ecosystem, including its migratory pathways, habitat, and breeding grounds, is essential for the survival of marine mammals, fish, seabirds, other wildlife, and the subsistence communities that depend on them. These communities possess a unique understanding of the Arctic ecosystem, and their traditional knowledge should serve as an important resource to inform Federal decisionmaking.\nSec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to enhance the resilience of the northern Bering Sea region by conserving the region's ecosystem, including those natural resources that provide important cultural and subsistence value and services to the people of the region. For the purpose of carrying out the specific directives provided herein, this order delineates an area hereafter referred to as the \"Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area,\" in which the exercise of relevant authorities shall be coordinated among all executive departments and agencies (agencies). All agencies charged with regulating, overseeing, or conducting activities in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area shall do so with attention to the rights, needs, and knowledge of Alaska Native tribes; the delicate and unique ecosystem; the protection of marine mammals, fish, seabirds, and other wildlife; and with appropriate coordination with the State of Alaska.\nThe boundary of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area includes waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone bounded to the north by the seaward boundary of the Bering Straits Native Corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; to the south by the southern boundaries of the Northern Bering Sea Research Area, the St. Matthew Habitat Conservation Area, and the Nunivak-Kuskokwim Habitat Conservation Area; and to the west by the maritime boundary delimited by the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Maritime Boundary, signed at Washington, June 1, 1990.\nSec. 3. Withdrawal. Under the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition by leasing for a time period without specific expiration the following areas of the Outer Continental Shelf: (1) the area currently designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as the Norton Basin Planning Area; and (2) the Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area lying within 25 nautical miles of St. Lawrence Island. The boundaries of the withdrawn areas are more specifically delineated in the attached map and, with respect to the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area, the accompanying table of withdrawn Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks. Both the map and table form a part of this order, with the table governing the withdrawal and withdrawal boundaries within the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area. This withdrawal prevents consideration of these areas for future oil or gas leasing for purposes of exploration, development, or production. This withdrawal furthers the principles of responsible public stewardship entrusted to this office and takes due consideration of the importance of the withdrawn area to Alaska Native tribes, wildlife, and wildlife habitat, and the need for regional resiliency in the face of climate change. Nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.\nSec. 4. Task Force on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. (a) There is established a Task Force on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area (Bering Task Force), under the Arctic Executive Steering Committee (AESC) established in Executive Order 13689, to be co-chaired by an office of the Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n(b) The membership of the Bering Task Force (member agencies) shall include, in addition to the Co-Chairs, designated senior-level representatives from:\n(i) the Department of State;\n(ii) the Department of Defense;\n(iii) the Department of Transportation;\n(iv) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n(v) the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;\n(vi) the U.S. Arctic Research Commission;\n(vii) the National Science Foundation; and\n(viii) such agencies and offices as the Co-Chairs may designate.\n(c) Consistent with the authorities and responsibilities of its member agencies, the Bering Task Force, with the purpose of advancing the United States policy in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area as set forth in section 2 of this order, shall:\n(i) Establish and provide regular opportunities to consult with the Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council as described in section 5 of this order;\n(ii) Coordinate activities of member agencies, including regulatory, policy, and research activities, affecting the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area and its value for subsistence and cultural purposes; (iii) Consider the need for additional actions or strategies to advance the policies established in section 2 of this order and provide recommendations as appropriate to the President through the AESC;\n(iv) Consider and make recommendations with respect to the impacts of shipping on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area including those described in sections 7 and 8 of this order; and\n(v) In developing and implementing recommendations, coordinate or consult as appropriate with existing AESC working groups, the State of Alaska, regional and local governments, Alaska Native tribal governments, Alaska Native corporations and organizations, the private sector, other relevant organizations, and academia.\nSec. 5. The Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council. (a) The Bering Task Force, within 6 months of the date of this order, and after considering recommendations from Alaska Native tribal governments, shall, in accordance with existing law, establish a Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council, for the purpose of providing input to the Bering Task Force and facilitating effective consultation with Alaska Native tribal governments.\n(b) The Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council shall be charged with providing input and recommendations on activities, regulations, guidance, or policy that may affect actions or conditions in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area, with attention given to climate resilience; the rights, needs, and knowledge of Alaska Native tribes; the delicate and unique ecosystem; and the protection of marine mammals and other wildlife.\n(c) The Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council should include between 9 and 11 elected officials or their designees representing Alaska Native tribal governments with a breadth of interests in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area, and may include such additional Federal officials and State and local government elected officials as the Bering Task Force deems appropriate. The Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council will adopt such procedures as it deems necessary to govern its activities.\nSec. 6. Traditional Knowledge in Decisionmaking. It shall be the policy of the United States to recognize and value the participation of Alaska Native tribal governments in decisions affecting the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area and for all agencies to consider traditional knowledge in decisions affecting the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. Specifically, all agencies shall consider applicable information from the Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council in the exercise of existing agency authorities. Such input may be received through existing agency procedures and consultation processes.\nSec. 7. Pollution from Vessels. The Bering Task Force, within 9 months of the date of this order and after coordination as needed with existing working groups within the AESC, shall provide the AESC with recommendations on:\n(a) Actions to ensure or support implementation of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters, as adopted by the International Maritime Organization, especially with respect to limitations on discharges from vessels in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area; and\n(b) Any additional measures necessary to achieve the policies established in section 2 of this order, such as the potential identification of zero-discharge zones, assessments of the pollution risks posed by increased vessel traffic, or noise reduction measures associated with sensitive ecological and cultural areas within the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area.\nSec. 8. Shipping Routing Measures. (a) In recognition of the United States commitment to reduce the impact of shipping within the Bering Sea and the Bering Strait and the many environmental factors in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area that inform the best routes for navigation, safety, and the marine environment, the U.S. Coast Guard should conclude its ongoing port access route study for the Chukchi Sea, Bering Strait, and Bering Sea (Bering Sea PARS) pursuant to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, 33 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.\n(b) In designation of routes and any areas to be avoided, and consistent with existing authorities, consideration should be given to the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area, including the effects of shipping and vessel pollution on the marine environment, fishery resources, the seabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf, marine mammal migratory pathways and other biologically important areas, and subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing.\n(c) In recognition of the value of participation of Alaska Native tribal governments in decisions affecting the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area, the U.S. Coast Guard should consider traditional knowledge, including with respect to marine mammal, waterfowl, and seabird migratory pathways and feeding and breeding grounds, in the development of the Bering Sea PARS, establishment of routing measures and any areas to be avoided, and subsequent rulemaking and management decisions.\n(d) No later than December 30, 2016, the U.S. Coast Guard shall publish preliminary findings for the Bering Sea PARS in the Federal Register, including information related to its status, potential routing measures, and its projected schedule. The U.S. Coast Guard should also consider using this opportunity to provide notice of any new information or proposed measures resulting from its ongoing consultation process.\n(e) Upon completion of the Bering Sea PARS, the U.S. Coast Guard shall promptly issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for any designation contemplated on the basis of the study. The U.S. Coast Guard shall coordinate as appropriate with the Department of State and other coastal nations and submit any proposed routing measures to the International Maritime Organization by 2018 for the purpose of their adoption and implementation.\nSec. 9. Oil Spill Preparedness. The U.S. Coast Guard, in coordination with all relevant agencies and the State of Alaska, shall update the Area Contingency plans, the Subarea Response Plans, and the Geographic Response Strategies relevant to the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. These plans and strategies shall be consistent with the National Contingency Plan, and shall include appropriate measures to improve local response capacity and preparedness such as spill response training opportunities for local communities, including Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response training for Village Public Safety Officers and other first responders.\nSec. 10. Continuity of Existing Habitat Protection. The area included in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area is currently closed to commercial non-pelagic trawl gear under rules implementing the Fishery Management Plans of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area and the Arctic Management Area. Consistent with existing law, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in coordination with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, shall take such actions as are necessary to support the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including actions to maintain the existing prohibitions on the use of commercial non-pelagic trawl gear.\nSec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (1) the authority granted by law to a department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(2) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistently with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The policies set forth in this order are consistent with existing U.S. obligations under international law and nothing in this order shall be construed to derogate from obligations under applicable international law.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nDecember 9, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Executive Order 13754—Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience"}

I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the treaties.\nThe purpose of the treaties is to establish our maritime boundaries in the South Pacific Ocean with two neighboring countries. The treaty with Kiribati establishes three maritime boundaries totaling approximately 1,260 nautical miles in length between Kiribati and the United States islands of Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Jarvis Island, and Baker Island. The treaty with the Federated States of Micronesia establishes a single maritime boundary of approximately 447 nautical miles in length between the Micronesian islands and the United States territory of Guam. The boundaries define the limit within which each country may exercise maritime jurisdiction with respect to its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.\nI believe these treaties to be fully in the interest of the United States. They reflect the tradition of cooperation and close ties with Kiribati and with the Federated States of Micronesia in this region. These boundaries have never been disputed, and the delimitation in the treaties conforms closely to the limits the United States has long asserted for our exclusive economic zone in the relevant areas.\nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaties, and give its advice and consent to ratification.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nDecember 9, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Message to the Senate Transmitting the Kiribati-United States and Micronesia-United States Maritime Boundary Treaties"}

I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Treaty, which contains a detailed article-by-article analysis of the Treaty.\nThe Treaty is designed to regulate the international trade in conventional arms—including small arms, tanks, combat aircraft, and warships—and to reduce the risk that international arms transfers will be used to commit atrocities, without impeding the legitimate arms trade. It will contribute to international peace and security, will strengthen the legitimate international trade in conventional arms, and is fully consistent with rights of U.S. citizens (including those secured by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution). United States national control systems and practices to regulate the international transfer of conventional arms already meet or exceed the requirements of the Treaty, and no further legislation is necessary to comply with the Treaty. A key goal of the Treaty is to persuade other States to adopt national control systems for the international transfer of conventional arms that are closer to our own high standards.\nBy providing a basis for insisting that other countries improve national control systems for the international transfer of conventional arms, the Treaty will help reduce the risk that international transfers of specific conventional arms and items will be abused to carry out the world's worst crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. It will be an important foundational tool in ongoing efforts to prevent the illicit proliferation of conventional weapons around the world, which creates instability and supports some of the world's most violent regimes, terrorists, and criminals. The Treaty commits States Parties to establish and maintain a national system for the international transfer of conventional arms and to implement provisions of the Treaty that establish common international standards for conducting the international trade in conventional arms in a responsible manner. The Treaty is an important first step in bringing other countries up towards our own high national standards that already meet or exceed those of the Treaty.\nThe Treaty will strengthen our security without undermining legitimate international trade in conventional arms. The Treaty reflects the realities of the global nature of the defense supply chain in today's world. It will benefit U.S. companies by requiring States Parties to apply a common set of standards in regulating the defense trade, which establishes a more level playing field for U.S. industry. Industry also will benefit from the international transparency required by the Treaty, allowing U.S. industry to be better informed in advance of the national regulations of countries with which it is engaged in trade. This will provide U.S. industry with a clearer view of the international trading arena, fostering its ability to make more competitive and responsible business decisions based on more refined strategic analyses of the risks, including risks of possible diversion or potential gaps in accountability for international arms transfers, and the associated mitigation measures to reduce such risks in a given market. The Treaty explicitly reaffirms the sovereign right of each country to decide for itself, pursuant to its own constitutional and legal system, how to deal with conventional arms that are traded exclusively within its borders. It also recognizes that legitimate purposes and interests exist for both individuals and governments to own, transfer, and use conventional arms. The Treaty is fully consistent with the domestic rights of U.S. citizens, including those guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.\nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty, and that it give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty, subject to the understandings and declarations set forth in the accompanying report.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nDecember 9, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Message to the Senate Transmitting the Arms Trade Treaty"}

The report of the Secretary of State, which includes an overview of the Convention, is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\nThe Convention requires the application of the modern transparency measures contained in the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Transparency Rules to certain investor-state arbitrations occurring under international investment agreements concluded before April 2014, including under the investment chapters of U.S. free trade agreements and U.S. bilateral investment treaties. These transparency measures include publication of various key documents from the arbitration proceeding, opening of hearings to the public, and permitting non-disputing parties and other interested third persons to make submissions to the tribunal. As the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules by their terms automatically apply to arbitrations commenced under international investment agreements concluded on or after April 1, 2014, and that use the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (unless the parties to such agreements agree otherwise), there is no need for the Convention to apply to international investment agreements concluded after that date.\nTransparency in investor-state arbitration is vital, given that governmental measures of interest to the broader public can be the subject matter of the proceedings. The United States has long been a leader in promoting transparency in investor-state arbitration, and the 11 most recently concluded U.S. international investment agreements that contain investor-state arbitration already provide for modern transparency measures similar to those made applicable by the Convention. However, 41 older U.S. international investment agreements lack all or some of the transparency measures. Should the United States become a party, the Convention would require the transparency measures to apply to arbitrations under U.S. international investment agreements concluded before April 2014, to the extent that other parties to those agreements also join the Convention and to the extent the United States and such other parties do not take reservations regarding such arbitrations. The Convention would also require the transparency measures to apply in investor-state arbitrations under those agreements when the United States is the respondent and the claimants consent to their application, even if the claimants are not from a party to the Convention.\nThe United States was a central participant in the negotiation of the Convention in the UNCITRAL. Ratification by the United States can be expected to encourage other countries to become parties to the Convention. The Convention would not require any implementing legislation.\nI recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification by the United States, subject to certain reservations.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nDecember 9, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-12-09", "title": "Message to the Senate Transmitting the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration"}

Go tohealthcare.gov and shop for the plan that is right for you. Like most Americans who get coverage through healthcare.gov, there's a good chance you'll find a plan that costs less than $75 a month. And while the enrollment period lasts until the end of January, as long as you sign up by this Thursday, December 15, you'll be covered starting January 1.\nNow, this doesn't apply to the roughly 250 million Americans who already get insurance through the workplace or thanks to Medicare or Medicaid. But here's what does. Every American with insurance is now covered by the strongest set of consumer protections in history: a true patients' bill of rights. You now have free preventive care, like mammograms and contraception. There are no more annual or lifetime limits on the essential care you receive. Women can't get charged more just for being a woman. Young people can stay on a parent's plan until they turn 26. And seniors get discounts on their prescriptions. Every American can rest free from the fear that one illness or accident will derail your dreams, because discrimination against preexisting conditions is now illegal. And since 2010, we've seen the slowest health care price growth in 50 years.\nWhether or not you get insurance through the Affordable Care Act, that's the health care system as we now know it now. Because our goal wasn't just to make sure more people have coverage, it was to make sure more people have better coverage. That's why we want to build on the progress we've made, and I've put forth a number of ideas for how to improve the Affordable Care Act.\nNow, Republicans in Congress want to repeal the whole thing and start from scratch, but trying to undo some of it could undo all of it. All those consumer protections—whether you get your health insurance from Obamacare or Medicare or Medicaid or on the job—could go right out the window. So any partisan talk you hear about repealing or replacing the Affordable Care Act should be judged by whether they keep all those improvements that benefit you and your family right now.\nFor example, one new study shows that if Congress repeals Obamacare as they've proposed, nearly 30 million Americans would lose their coverage—30 million. Four in five of them would come from working families. More than 9 million Americans who would receive tax credits to keep insurance affordable would no longer receive that help. That's unacceptable.\nWe can work together to make the system even better, and one of the best ways to do that is make sure that you're in it. So remember: Sign up on healthcare.gov by this Thursday, and your health insurance will be there for you when you wake up on January 1.\nThanks everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-12-10", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119848", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:55 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. I hope you all had a good weekend. I do not have any comments at the start, so we can go straight to questions.\nJosh, would you like to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Why don't we start with Aleppo? Does the U.S. government still think it's possible to prevent Aleppo from falling to the Syrian government, or is it possible to concede at this point that it's a lost cause?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, the United States government continues to be deeply concerned about the situation in Aleppo, and the violence there is only increasing. The risk facing innocent civilians has been grave for some time. It continues to worsen. Despite our best diplomatic efforts to reduce the violence and increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, the Assad government, backed by the Russians, continues to try to bomb innocent civilians into submission. And it's a terrible situation that does not appear to be getting better.\nQ: And the U.S. is saying that Russia has turned down a U.S. offer for a ceasefire. What were the terms of that ceasefire? And given that it seems that Russia and its Syrian partners are on the verge of winning 98 percent control of the area in Aleppo, according to the Syrian forces, why would Russia agree to our terms at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to the intricacies of the conversations that were taking place between Secretary Kerry and some of our top diplomats and their Russian counterparts. There were other countries that were involved in these conversations as well. So I can't speak to intricacies of the proposed arrangement, but I can certainly tell you what the goals were. The goal was to try to end the bombing, and the few innocent civilians that remain -- try to get them out of harm's way, and try to allow the flow of humanitarian assistance to these communities that have been shut off from the outside world for a long time.\nSo those were the goals all along. And in the months and years that we've been negotiating to try to find a diplomatic solution, we've been rebuffed by the Syrians because, with the backing of the Russians and the Iranians, they've continued to wage this war with virtual impunity.\nQ: Are you still pursuing a ceasefire effort with Russia at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the door remains open and we continue to be interested in trying to find a diplomatic solution to the situation not just in Aleppo but in Syria because we know that there's not a military solution that can be imposed on the situation. So, yes, we are still interested in diplomacy. We still are open to and interested in trying to find a diplomatic solution. But optimism is not high.\nQ: And turning to the cyber interference in the U.S. election. Does the White House -- well, I know you guys are doing your own investigation that the President has called for to hacking. Does the U.S. support congressional inquiries into that, and would you cooperate with them? And if so, do you have a preference as far as the format -- whether that should be the Senate Intelligence Committee, a select committee of some sort or other format?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, we certainly have long supported the principle of congressional review of this matter. There has been intensive cooperation between the intelligence community and other national security agencies and members of Congress in both parties, both before and after the election. The briefings have been provided in a variety of settings, both classified and unclassified. In some cases, it's briefings of members. In some cases, it's briefings of staff. In some cases, it's briefings of both.\nSo one of the stated goals of the ongoing review that the President ordered last week by the intelligence community was to compile information that could be presented to Congress. Presumably, that information would be useful in supporting a congressional review of this matter that is certainly warranted when you consider the stakes and the consequences.\nSo we support the principle of congressional review, but I wouldn't weigh in with an opinion right now about which committee should bear that responsibility.\nQ: But if Congress in some format takes upon itself to start a committee and look into it, even as you're doing your own investigation, the investigation would comply and cooperate to help that get moving forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. And as I mentioned, Josh, the administration and national security professionals, both high-ranking officials and those farther down the chain, have been in regular touch with members of Congress on this matter. There's been a substantial number of briefings and extensive communication between national security officials and Congress because of the rightful role that Congress has in this matter.\nQ: And I'm sure that you saw over the weekend the President-elect and his team disparaging the CIA, bringing up the Iraq war stuff, openly disputing the assessment of the intelligence community about Russian hacking, calling it ridiculous. Is the President concerned that the President-elect is undermining confidence in the intelligence community with those kinds of remarks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama's experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots. These are men and women with specialized skills, in many cases, who have chosen to not just dedicate their careers but dedicate their lives to our national security. They don't do it for the fame and the glory; in most cases, their identities are never known. I guess in many cases, their identities are never known. They aren't doing it because the pay is great. In many cases, these are professionals with substantial capabilities, with areas of expertise that would allow them to get a much bigger paycheck in the private sector.\nThese are men and women who dedicate themselves to this cause because they love this country. And President Obama has benefitted enormously from their work, from their expertise, from their advice, and from their service to the country. And President Obama is certainly not the first President to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I'm confident the President-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.\nAyesha.\nQ: Following up or continuing along the issue of the cyber-attack, I was wondering -- the Trump team has said that -- well, first I guess I want to ask, does the White House have a position on if the Russians were interfering, trying to -- attempting to interfere with the election, what their motives were? Was it to actually help elect Donald Trump? Or was it just to create chaos? And on top of that, the Trump team has said that this is an effort to delegitimize the results of the election. And I was just wondering, what does the White House say to the American people when they are hearing these reports about Russian interference? There are all these investigations going on -- to the average American, this may raise questions to them, even though the intelligence isn't necessarily questioning or saying that the actual votes were hacked or anything like that, the appearance of the interference could raise questions in the minds of Americans. So what does the White House say to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, there's obviously a lot there. Let me start by reminding you of the statement -- extraordinary statement that was issued by the U.S. intelligence community the first week in October. In that statement that reflected the consensus view of 17 different intelligence agencies, they've concluded and reported to the American public that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity in an attempt to destabilize our political system. That's a significant charge. And the fact that the intelligence community came forward and made public this assessment is extraordinary, even unprecedented. That's the first thing.\nThe second thing is there was a lot of reporting over the weekend about additional intelligence assessments that have been reached. If that's something that can be shared publicly, that's going to come from the intelligence community. It's not going to come from here. And that is evidence of the continued commitment of this administration to ensuring and even protecting the integrity of the basic institutions of government, including the intelligence community.\nThat all said, you didn't need a security clearance to figure out who benefitted from malicious Russian cyber activity. The President-elect didn't call it into question. He called on Russia to hack his opponent. He called on Russia to hack Secretary Clinton. So he certainly had a pretty good sense of whose side this activity was coming down on. The last several weeks of the election were focused on a discussion of emails that had been hacked and leaked by the Russians. These were emails from the DNC and John Podesta -- not from the RNC and Steve Bannon.\nIt was the President-elect who, over the course of the campaign, indicated that he thought that President Putin was a strong leader. It was the President-elect who indicated the potential that he would withdraw from some of our critically important NATO commitments. It was the President-elect who refused to disclose his financial connections to Russia. It was the President-elect who hired a campaign chairman with extensive, lucrative, personal financial ties to Russia. It was the President-elect who had a national security advisor on the campaign that had been a paid contributor to RT, the Russian propaganda outlet.\nThe President-elect's team, his campaign, didn't make any effort to obscure this. So all of that is information that was not obtained through intelligence channels. It's not information that was disclosed for the first time at the White House. It's all information that all of you reported on. It's information that all of you reported on well in advance of the election, and it's all information that is, as far as I can tell, undisputed.\nSo I think what it does, it probably leads people to a variety of conclusions. One conclusion that it leads me to is the special responsibility that members of Congress have to take a close look at this -- particularly those members of Congress that endorsed Mr. Trump in the election. They were aware of all this information, too -- not because they were getting classified briefings, but because it was available to the public.\nSo I think in some cases, we've seen some pretty heated rhetoric from Republicans wringing their hands about this and about the potential impact it has on our national security and the integrity of our system of government. I think they should spare us the handwringing and fulfill their basic responsibility, considering the bar has been raised based on their political choices.\nQ: But with everything that you just laid out, President-elect Trump has disputed the idea that Russia favored him or that Russia was behind or interfering, meddling in the election. I mean he says that no one knows what's going on. So you basically laid out a case that that's not the case. And if -- and just going on what you just said, doesn't that cast a cloud over this election -- I mean, everything that you just laid out saying that this is clearly done to favor President-elect Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, a couple of things here. The first is the conclusion about Russia's involvement in malicious cyber activity to undermine confidence in our political system represents the consensus view of the intelligence community. There's no disagreeing with that. And that's the reason that they came forward with that extraordinary statement a month before the election. So there is no -- there certainly should be no dispute about that. And the material that I cited, again, is not information that you're hearing from me for the first time. This is information that all of you have reported on, thoroughly investigated, and discussed on television.\nSo, again, there's no debate I'm seeking here. I, as I've done in the past, tried to just lay out some objective facts. The debate, the argument about the policy differences and the differences in agendas pursued by the President-elect and President Obama -- we had an opportunity to have that debate, and that was the subject of an extensive debate. And the election didn't turn out the way that we had hoped. And since then, I've gone to great lengths to try to avoid getting into a debate with the President-elect's team because our priority is on fulfilling the President's basic, institutional responsibilities to effect a smooth transition to the next presidency.\nSo what I've stated in not an argument, but really just a presentation of objective facts about what all of you and the American public knew in advance of the election. And, yes, this was all material that was known by Republican politicians in the Congress that endorsed the President-elect. And how they reconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is something they're going to have to explain.\nQ: One more topic. The President-elect also, over the weekend, he talked about his call with Taiwan and basically raised questions about whether the U.S. needs to be bound by the one-China policy. Obviously, China is very upset about this and has raised serious concerns about it. I was wondering -- I know that the Obama administration is saying that the one-China policy is still in effect, and it's very important. But I guess is there a concern going forward? Because it seems like the next administration is not going to take that stand. It's like what are the consequences, I guess, if President-elect Trump follows through without respecting or with not respecting the one-China policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States government under the leadership of President Obama has been and remains firmly committed to our one-China policy. That's also the policy, by the way, that previous Presidents in both parties have pursued. And our country has benefitted from adherence to that policy.\nOne reason that we have pursued that policy is because the Obama administration does not view Taiwan and our relationship with Taiwan as a bargaining chip. Taiwan is not a source of leverage. It's a close partner of the United States. Taiwan is the ninth largest trading partner of the United States. And bargaining that away is not something that this administration believes is in our best interest. And in fact, I think you'd be hard pressed to make the case that it's in the interest of Taiwan.\nBut what we have been able to do by pursuing that policy and adhering to that policy is to have a close partner in Taiwan and a constructive relationship with China, where we've been able to make important, even historic progress on climate change; and where we've unlocked cooperation on the Iran deal. We would not have succeeded in completing a diplomatic agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon without China's effective cooperation. We've been able to lower tensions around cyber issues, and we have been able to work effectively with the Chinese to ramp up pressure on North Korea.\nWe certainly don't agree with the Chinese on everything. But where common ground does exist, we've been able to make progress in a way that benefits the American people and benefits the Chinese people and, when it comes to climate change, benefits the planet. That kind of progress is much more difficult if tensions are heightened around our one-China policy.\nJustin.\nQ: I guess I wanted to go back to the presentation of objective facts, and it seems obvious that both Donald Trump and his campaign don't necessarily agree with that. We heard Donald Trump on Twitter I think this morning that it's impossible to tell who is responsible for hacking without catching them in the act. And then John Bolton, who's been a top advisor to him and is reportedly in line for a job at the State Department, last night floated the idea that the hack of the DNC could have been a false flag operation, and insinuated that perhaps the Obama administration was responsible for that. Obviously, I think both those statements raise a lot of questions. But I'm wondering what your response to either of those charges is.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I've tried to avoid responding to some of the charges from the President-elects Twitter feed. And what I've tried to do is just to present objective facts. And I think the objective fact that's relevant here is the intelligence community, a month before the election, came forward and presented a unanimous view, a high-confidence assessment that China was engaged in malicious cyber activity to destabilize our political system.\nQ: You said China. You mean --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry. Russia. Flipping back and forth between topics. Tricky. But thank you for clarifying. But listen, the intelligence community's assessment was unanimous and direct about Russia's malicious cyber activity.\nQ: Can't you just say that he's wrong on both these fronts? We can -- isn't that what you're trying to say here, that the U.S. can determine a hack even if they don't catch someone in the act, and that the Obama administration did not conduct a false flag operation on the DNC?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will rule out that the United States, in any way, engaged in the kind of false flag operation that a wide range of irresponsible conspiracy theorists have put forward. So we can dispense with that. But, look, I've gone to great lengths to try to avoid the whole charges-counter charges. So the President-elect has said one thing on Twitter. But 17 intelligence agencies of the United States have come forward. They came forward two months ago to put forward their unanimous assessment about Russia's malicious cyber activity. And I'll let you and the American people judge who is in a better position to defend their argument.\nQ: Sticking with this morning's Twitter, President-elect Trump said that costs on the F-35 project were \"out of control,\" and that he hoped to save billions on the project going forward. This is a problem. Their project has been sort of plagued by delays and cost overruns in the past. I'm wondering if you agree that there are still issues going forward, or if the administration's position is that costs have stabilized for the F-35.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak in detail about the F-35 program. I know that we have worked hard to institute the kinds of reforms that would limit cost overruns. What impact that would have on the F-35 program is something we can look into for you. As we discussed a little bit last week, this administration has put forward a wide range of cost-saving reforms that Republicans in Congress have either rejected or even refused to consider. Now, keep in mind, these are reforms that our military leaders say would save taxpayers money and would make the country safer.\nSo I guess you'd have to ask Republicans why they can both claim -- or how they can both claim to be fiscal conservatives and tough on national defense when they're blocking reforms that would save taxpayer dollars and make the country safer. That's hard to reconcile. But I think one could conclude that they're actually more focused on politics and obstructing the agenda of the Democratic President than they are on actually trying to save taxpayers money or keep the country safe.\nQ: Finally, the vice president of Aetna today was testifying about the merger, and said that his company should have withdrawn from all of the Obamacare marketplaces because the program wasn't economically viable. So obviously there's some question about whether they did so for reasons surrounding this merger. But I'm wondering -- this is something he said under oath -- whether you would dispute that, and whether if a major insurer at this point said this in testimony at a trial, what that kind of says about the overall health of the Obamacare program.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see the entirety of his testimony, and obviously I'm going to allow business executives to make whatever business decisions they believe is in the best interests of their company and their shareholders. I think I'd just point out that since the Affordable Care Act went into effect stock prices of most health care companies have gone up, in some cases quite substantially. Many health insurance companies have been able to effectively provide coverage through the marketplace that has been good for their company's bottom line and good for their company's shareholders. It's also been good for the United States of America -- 20 million more Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance. The growth in health care costs is at a near all-time low.\nSo I think the benefits of our approach speaks for itself when you consider the way that millions of Americans have benefitted from health care reform under President Obama, and we've been able to design a reform of the private health insurance market in a way that ends up being both good for customers, but also good for providers as well.\nGardiner.\nQ: Josh, what does it mean that Trump has upended two of the most sensitive relationships that the U.S. has -- Russia and China?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I -- President Obama has obviously worked hard to manage those relationships in a way that gives the United States the opportunity to capitalize on common ground where it exists even as we speak bluntly about our differences. And in each case, our differences are substantial, but in each case, effective diplomacy resulted in both those countries bolstering our effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and further isolate the North Korean regime for their destabilizing activities on the North Korean Peninsula.\nThose are just a couple of examples. There are also individual examples with regard to our relationship. Obviously the United States was able to work effectively with Russia to destroy the declared chemical weapons stockpile of the Assad regime. That would not have occurred had the United States and Russia not been able to work effectively together. And because we did that there are tons of chemical weapons that are not floating on the battlefield in Syria that could potentially fall into the hands of ISIL terrorists. Those chemicals have been destroyed because the United States and Russia worked together.\nIt doesn't mean that we patched up all our differences with Russia. It means that we identified a common interest and didn't let our differences interfere with our ability to achieve it in a way that makes the world safer.\nA similar analogy exists around climate change with regard to the U.S. relationship with China. The ability of the United States and China to work together to reach a mutual agreement to cap our carbon emissions catalyzed the international community in reaching an historic Paris agreement about a year later that's actually the first time the United States -- or the first time the world has come together to confront this substantial challenge. And that's evidence of tough, principled diplomacy that doesn't ignore our differences but rather prevents our differences from blocking our ability to advance our interests and do good things for the American people.\nAnd ultimately the next President will have to determine what kind of approach he wants to take in managing those relationships to ensure that we can protect our interests but also capitalize on opportunities when they arise.\nQ: \"Ultimately\" seems to be happening right now. There's obviously a longtime understanding that there is one President at a time, but this President-elect seems to be almost uniquely interfering in the international affairs of President Obama. You are having to scramble in your discussions with the Chinese. This President-elect seems to be scrambling somewhat your relationship with the Russians. Can you talk about the particular challenges you are facing in this transition considering that the comments and the tweets that this President-elect seems to be affecting in real time, right now, your relationships with two of the most important countries in the world?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Gardiner, the truth is that, as we discussed quite extensively in advance of the election, that rhetoric and tweets and tactics of the President-elect were having an impact on our relationship with countries around the world. We talked in here quite extensively about how other world leaders had raised concerns with President Obama or raised worries with President Obama about that rhetoric and some of those comments. This is not particularly new. They certainly do have -- take on added weight now that they don't just come from the Republican nominee but that they come from the President-elect. But ultimately this is part of what a transition is about, which is trying to lay the groundwork for the next President to succeed.\nSo we're going to continue to try to make very clear to countries around the world -- both our allies and countries like China and Russia that are decidedly not allies -- exactly what the longstanding policy of the United States has been, because in many cases those policies are in the best interest of the United States. But what the President-elect chooses to do with that opportunity will be up to him.\nQ: Josh, is the President concerned about the President-elect singling out individual companies like Lockheed which then see their market values plunge? You have spoken about the power of words from the President before -- their effect on markets. This President-elect seems to not just fail to understand that, but almost gleefully use his comments and his tweets to affect not only the behavior of companies but their stock prices, their valuations, and the rest. Do you see that as an appropriate use of presidential power and prerogative?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, ultimately President-elect Trump has been advocating a different kind of strategy for economic growth and job creation in the country, and we're going to have an opportunity to see if it works.\nPresident Obama has pursued a strategy that's rooted in investments in the middle class and focusing on the best interests of people who are in the middle class and working hard to get there. Those investments in infrastructure, asking those at the top of the income scale to pay a little bit more, have resulted in a strong economy. Our economy is currently in the midst of the longest streak of job growth on record. Over the last 81 months, 15.6 million private sector jobs have been created, and unemployment has been cut in half since the peak of the recession.\nI went through before about the positive trends that we're seeing related to wages and reduction in inequality. The stock market has even tripled since the lows that it hit in March of 2009. And the poverty rate fell farther and faster in 2015 than it had in any year since the 1960s. Those the results of the economic strategy that President Obama has pursued.\nAnd the President-elect is already showing the different kind of strategy that he intends to pursue. And we'll see if it works.\nQ: Josh, you obviously have, over the last year, had very critical comments about Mr. Trump, comments that you have not gone away from. You have stood by them. You've simply said that we're now focused on the transition. I'm just -- you, a year ago, mentioned that Mr. Trump had fake hair. I'm just wondering if you still stand behind that. And is there a hair transition going on? (Laughter.) Is there some training of barbers to deal with this challenge going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: So, look, I think anybody who has done this job for two and a half years I think has probably said a thing or two that he or she wished they hadn't said. And I think you've identified one of the things that I wish I hadn't said.\nQ: Hair-raising stories.\nMR. EARNEST: Let the puns begin. Although, let's keep that to Twitter.\nOlivier.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned the early October announcement from the intelligence community. You talked about I guess this new internal look at what the evidence shows about Russia's activities. The President is the ultimate declassifying authority. How much evidence, as opposed to merely findings, are you willing to declassify to show to the American people to back up these really startling claims?\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, this process is one that the President ordered just last week, and men and women in our intelligence community are working hard to do this review and prepare as much information as possible about what transpired, about how it happened, and what Russia was hoping to accomplish. So I wouldn't prejudge at this point what will actually be included in the final report, in the final review. But the President certainly is interested in getting to the bottom of it.\nAnd one of the goals of doing the review, one of the purposes of doing the review is to communicate with the American public what we know. There are going to be some limitations in our ability to do that because we're also going to have to protect the sources and methods that are used by the international community to obtain this information. Those are sources and methods that on an ongoing basis are critical to our national security.\nSo it seems unlikely at this point that the entire report would be declassified and released. But certainly the classified elements of the report will be shared, including with Congress in those classified channels. And we'll release and declassify -- we'll declassify and release as much information as we can. But at this point it's hard to predict exactly what that means.\nQ: The other October statement was about what China -- Russia -- sorry, you're contagious --\nMR. EARNEST: It's tricky, isn't it?\nQ: What Russia was trying to do. Was Russia successful, ultimately? And if they were, does that mean that on this President's watch, Moscow was able to influence an American election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so I think it's important, Olivier, to understand the two goals -- or sort of the two priorities that we'd identified. The first is the protection of the basic election administration infrastructure of the country. You'll recall that we had detected that some entities tied to Russia had succeeded in intruding on some websites used by election administrators across the country. Now, we also talked a lot about how difficult a task it would be to succeed in disrupting the casting and counting of ballots, primarily because our election infrastructure is decentralized and administered in a variety of ways, and so that could make it -- that would make hacking that system -- that decentralized system -- quite challenging.\nBut the integrity of our election system is critical to our democracy. And so this administration did work effectively with Democratic and Republican election administrators all across the country to help them bolster their cyber defenses against those Russian intrusions. This is an effort that was run through the Department of Homeland Security. And there were experts in the cyber department of Department of Homeland Security who worked with officials all across the country to bolster those defenses.\nAnd what the intelligence community has said since Election Day is that there was no increase in malicious cyber activity from the Russians against the elections infrastructure that interfered with the ability of people to cast ballots and have them counted accurately.\nSo that was a priority. And there was an enormous amount of work, much of which took place behind the scenes, that went into protecting the integrity of the system that we have in this country for casting and counting ballots.\nSeparately, there was a concern about the hack-and-leak strategy that Russia had used against Democrats and allies of the Clinton campaign. And in the five weeks since Election Day, we've heard from a lot of experts and analysts reviewing the election and trying to understand how this surprising outcome came about. And there are a variety of theories and analyses that have reached a variety of different conclusions. So I'm confident that people will take a look at all of this.\nI know that there are some people, particularly on the Democratic side, who have been harshly critical of some of the decisions that FBI Director Jim Comey made in releasing some information about the Bureau's investigation of Secretary Clinton. There are others who have been critical of the electoral strategy pursued by Secretary Clinton -- both in terms of her messaging, but also in terms of her travel in battleground states. This is something I think people are going to be chewing over for quite some time as they try to read the electorate and discern what factors may have contributed to the outcome.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, you rattled off a number of facts, as you said, publicly acknowledged, widely reported information linking Russia and Donald Trump --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that are not in dispute.\nQ: Right. But that also does sort of take the White House off the hook for not having launched this probe earlier. Do you regret not having launched it prior to the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, the only reason that the intelligence community could release a unanimous assessment of Russia's malicious cyber activity is because they've been investigating it. So this is something that our intelligence community and our national security infrastructure was closely monitoring. They've been doing that for a long time. And they are aware, and we've discussed the unique vulnerability that the United States has in cyberspace, given how our advanced economy is so reliant on those kinds of Internet connections for elements of our daily life. And so our national security infrastructure is oriented to monitor threats to that system and to try to protect against vulnerabilities. So this is something that we've been closely watching since long before the election started.\nQ: Well, why not announce the probe back when the DNI released the statement in October?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the reason that the statement was released was precisely because there was an ongoing probe.\nQ: Right, but this new probe you're characterizing as something new, something more than what had already been --\nMR. EARNEST: This review is just a retroactive one. So this is a probe that won't just include a review of malicious cyber activity in the 2016 election; it also will include a close look at potential cyber intrusions in 2012 and 2008 that --\nQ: -- think that was required in October?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the malicious Russian cyber activity that was announced in October was already under investigation. So this was something that we were already looking at. That's the only reason we were in a position to talk about it.\nQ: Because you know -- because Donald Trump and a number of his team members are characterizing this as politically motivated, not just false flags, but frankly, made up by the administration, saying -- the President-elect himself tweeted out, saying if this was known why wasn't it said prior to the election? You point out that in October we were saying that, yes, but for the White House not to have -- or at least be perceived to have put its shoulder behind this kind of probe the way that the President has now done is what I'm trying to get at.\nMR. EARNEST: I see.\nQ: Why didn't he do that then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in part because -- well, again, so it's important for people to understand that this is something that was the subject of an ongoing investigation. Even in the days and weeks leading up to the election. Our intelligence community, our national security agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, were closely watching Russia's malicious cyber activity. There was an ongoing investigation. It was being investigated. It was being closely watched in order to protect our democracy.\nWhat is also important is not just the mobilizing and marshaling of that expertise to protect the country in cyberspace, but also to protect the integrity of the institutions. You all covered the election closely and know how it would have been consumed if the President had -- to borrow your phrase -- put his shoulder against the intelligence community and pressed them to conduct an investigation that would have called into question, just weeks before an election, whether or not politics was driving that decision.\nThat's why, at every turn, President Obama prioritized the integrity of our national security infrastructure and our intelligence community. Now that the election is over, it's important for the integrity of our democracy for our intelligence community the take a look at what happened in 2016 and in 2012 and in 2008 to ensure that as our country conducts future elections that we can more effectively confront some of the malicious forces that may be seeking to interfere in our system of democracy.\nQ: But to counter some of those accusations about the motivations of the administration in announcing that, can you just make clear whether -- rule out, if you would, if that is, in fact, the case that you were not in any way suggesting that the results of the election had been compromised?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this goes back to Olivier's question -- I'm trying to make sure that we don't talk past each other. I think the thing that is really clear and something that we have acknowledged for weeks now is that the intelligence community did not detect any increase in malicious cyber activity on Election Day that interfered with the casting and accurate counting of ballots. That is not my opinion; that is based on the close monitoring by the intelligence community and other national security agencies that have a responsibility of protecting us in cyberspace.\nBut what's also clear is that the results of the hack and leak operation carried out on the orders of Russia were extensively discussed in the weeks before Election Day. The results of those operations were extensively discussed. There was a daily leaking of John Podesta's emails at websites that all of you news organizations closely monitored. And those are editorial decisions that are left in your hands and the hands of the people who work at your news organizations. But you weren't waiting for leaks from the RNC or from Steve Bannon.\nAnd I think that's illustrative of -- well, people can draw their own judgments, and obviously the intelligence community will do the same thing. But you don't need a security clearance to get access to that information to draw your own judgment.\nQ: Well, there are some on Capitol Hill -- Democrats among them -- who are saying the White House has pulled its punches with Russia, and on this particular issue they have been concerned that there hasn't been a stronger response. At the time, the White House said there would be a proportional one. Has there been a response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at the same time that we discussed the fact that there would be a proportional response we also made clear that the details of the response were something that we were unlikely to be able to discuss in public. So if --\nQ: Were they undertaken at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, even to confirm the nature of our response at this point -- well, I'm just not going to be in a position to discuss exactly what the response is or will be. There are a variety of reasons for that. But I can offer the same assurance that I did before the election that the President and his team believe that a proportional response is warranted.\nQ: Is it safe to assume that the announcement of this probe isn't the extent of the response?\nMR. EARNEST: At the risk of going down a slippery slope on this, yes, it is fair for you to assume that this probe is not the extent of the response to Russia for their malicious cyber activity in the run-up to the election.\nAndrew.\nQ: I just want to clear something up, Josh. You seem to be -- correct me if I'm wrong -- but you seem to be suggesting that Russia didn't have to hack ballot machines or the actual vote tally in order to have a determinant effect on the outcome of the election.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess what I'm doing is I'm trying to be as specific and as clear as I possibly can about what our approach to confronting this challenge was, and the first was taking a close look at what steps would be necessary to protect our elections infrastructure and to protect the accurate casting and counting of ballots.\nAnd there was a whole lot of work that took place behind the scenes in the weeks and even months leading up to Election Day by experts at the Department of Homeland Security with election administrators all across the country to protect their systems against Russian cyber intrusions. And what we have learned since Election Day is that, based on the careful monitoring of a variety of national security agencies, we can conclude that there was no increase in the Russian malicious cyber activity on Election Day that was aimed at disrupting the casting and counting of ballots.\nBut, separately, you've asked this other question about the hack and leak operations carried out by the Russians. There's no denying that the results of those hack and leak operations were part of the debate in the days and weeks leading up to Election Day. That also is just an objective fact. There was extensive coverage of the daily leaks of John Podesta's emails. That's just -- that's true.\nTo the extent that any Republicans were hacked, the only time that occurred as far as I can tell is when Colin Powell's emails were hacked just so that they could release information critical to Secretary Clinton. That seemed to be the only revealing thing in the emails from General Powell's email account that were released.\nSo, again, I think there's -- and again, that's not based on any intelligence assessment. That doesn't require a security clearance. That's something that was widely reported by all of you, and I think an indication of the kind of information that people can use as they factor into their judgment about what Russia may have been trying to do.\nQ: But you accept that it's possible that that alone could have affected the outcome of the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned in response to Olivier, there are a variety of factors that many people legitimately think contributed to the outcome, and whether you want to question the propriety of some of FBI Director Comey's pronouncements or the wisdom of Secretary Clinton's strategy for campaigning -- those kinds of things are open to debate and I think will be open to careful analysis by political scientists for months, if not years, as they try to determine why the election outcome was so surprising to so many people, including both candidates.\nQ: Just to follow up on Margaret's question -- this question has a proportional response. There must have been a debate here at the time about whether your response should be covert, and I'm wondering if, in retrospect, you think -- whether you think there could be a revisiting of that decision, given the level of unease among U.S. citizens about what's happened, and level of unease in democracies like Sweden and Germany, where people believe that their system of government is under threat.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what I will acknowledge is that there are a variety of policy questions that are raised in the United States and in democracies around the world based on what transpired in the United States on Election Day, and in days and weeks that led up to Election Day.\nI'm just not going to be in a position to talk about the internal conversations about a potential proportional response other than to say that those discussions have occurred and the President concluded that a proportional response was appropriate. But at this point, I just can't get into the wisdom of how or whether or when that proportional response could be publicly discussed.\nQ: Would you expect the President to revisit that decision once the results of the review have come through?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. I mean, look, the thing that I've said all along is that proportional response is appropriate; we may or may not be in a position to disclose what that response is. That's still true. There still could be a time when this is something that we're able to discuss more publicly. If there is, that wouldn't necessarily reflect a change in our position or strategy. But at this point, it's difficult to speculate exactly how or whether that will play out.\nQ: Well, except that the Vice President said that he hoped that we didn't know what would happen -- right?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, he did say that at one point. And, look, I think that goes to many of the questions that are raised about whether or not discussing the proportional response in public could undermine the effectiveness of that response. But it's, ironically enough, difficult to assess that if you can't discuss the response itself in public.\nRon.\nQ: So is this where the White House intends to leave this issue of how determinative or not the hacking operation was or wasn't to the outcome of the election? You're essentially saying it's one of many factors that happened during the final run-up to Election Day, and the President can't determine whether that was more significant than whether Secretary Clinton had campaigned here or there, or what -- is that where you leave us?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, at least for today, I don't have any sort of election analysis -- official White House election analysis to put forward.\nQ: That's what people want to know -- does the President think that the Russians swung this election somehow. Simple question. It's not a simple question, but it's the question -- that's what people want to know. Does the President think the Russians swung this election somehow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what we're focused on right now is trying to understand exactly what the Russians did, collect as much available information as we can about that, try to assess what their motives were. And, look, I think this may be a question that people are going to continue to ask as Congress steps forward to fulfill their responsibility that they have to take a look at this. And, look, I think in some ways this is going to be a pointed question -- in some ways, this is not just a question to ask the President; this is actually an even better question to ask supporters of Mr. Trump's campaign, many of whom now, at least in Congress, are worried about the answer to that question.\nQ: Because you think that they will conclude that the hack and leak operation did, in fact, swing the election?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what they would conclude. But what we have right now on Capitol Hill is a situation where many Republicans who offered their endorsement of the Trump campaign, less than five weeks later are now publicly worrying about Russian influence. And again, how they reconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is a question that they're going to have to answer.\nQ: Just on one -- you talk about on Election Day and the analysis that's been done -- you say there was no increase in Russian malicious activity then. The word \"increase\" kind of stands out. Was there some malicious Russian activity going on that did not increase on that day, so there was a baseline of ongoing malicious Russian activity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly know that there is a baseline of Russian malicious activity in cyberspace, and I think that's a given and I think it's something that we're all aware of. For more details about what the intelligence community perceived on Election Day, that's something you'll have to ask them. But what --\nQ: You're essentially ruling out that the Russians did something on Election Day that altered the vote count -- that somehow, mechanically or otherwise, in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, where there was this \"surprising outcome\" -- you are ruling out that the Russians did anything that caused that? Or are you not ruling that out?\nMR. EARNEST: What I am saying is a little repetitive, but that's by design. I'm trying to --\nQ: But that's the issue, and we understand -- the hack and leak and the election.\nMR. EARNEST: But I'm talking specifically about this question that you're posing about cyber activity and the counting and casting of ballots. And for more precision, I'd refer you to the intelligence community. But I think it's pretty clear what I'm saying here, which is that on Election Day there was no observed increase in malicious Russian cyber activity that altered or disrupted the accurate casting and counting of ballots.\nQ: There are a number of electors who are requesting an intelligence briefing before they vote. Does the White House support that?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw those reports shortly before I walked out here, and I understand that some of them may have sent a letter to the intelligence community or to the White House. I haven't seen the letter, so we'll take a look and --\nQ: Conceptually, does the White House support that? Or do you think we need to just kind of close the book on this?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd want to take a look at the letter before I respond.\nQ: And just one last thing. On these reports about the President-elect declining daily presidential briefings, intelligence briefings, how concerned is the President about that in terms of the security of the nation, which is obviously is his main objective? How concerned is the President that the President-elect is apparently not doing these briefings on a daily basis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess a couple of things come to mind. The first is over the course of the Republican primary, the President-elect had criticized President Bush for not sufficiently protecting the country from 9/11, and even criticized him for not carefully listening to the Presidential Daily Briefing that was later declassified that warned of 9/11.\nSo the President-elect, certainly firsthand, understands how important the presentation of this intelligence information is. And as I mentioned at the top of the briefing, President Obama has deep respect and admiration for the men and women of our intelligence community that work literally through the night to compile an intelligence briefing for the President of the United States that includes the most accurate, up-to-date information possible. And in order to make good decisions, a President has to have access to good information. And by good information, I mean information that is accurate, that is up to date, that is presented clearly, and President Obama has benefitted from that.\nThe decisions that he's made have benefitted from that, and the American people have benefitted from that.\nWhat's also true is that the intelligence community needs to be able to operate without fear of retribution for presenting bad news. That's often part and parcel of the Presidential Daily Briefing. These are the bad things that are happening in the world, or these are the potential negative consequences for the United States as a result of a global event. It's important for the intelligence community to not be in a position where these professionals who are dedicating their lives to the protection of the United States are not subjected to retribution just because the person who is reading the briefing may not want to hear bad news.\nQ: So it sounds like you're saying the President is concerned that the President-elect is not taking these briefings.\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is that President Obama has benefited enormously, and the country has benefited enormously, from his ability to make good decisions based on good information. And the only way that he is able to obtain that good information -- and by good information I mean up-to-date and accurate information -- is because of the tireless efforts of the experts and patriots in the intelligence community.\nKevin.\nQ: Would it then be a mistake for the President-elect to not do the same, especially once he assumes the office?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President-elect is going to have to develop his own routine and his own strategy for educating and equipping himself with the necessary knowledge to make good decisions for the country. And like every other American, I'm hoping he'll do that.\nQ: Let me circle back on the one-China question that you fielded earlier. How important is that policy for U.S.-China relations and the stability in that region?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned the day after this issue arose -- or at least the first time that this issue arose in the Briefing Room, which I think was a week ago now -- I made clear that this is an issue the Chinese government considers to be highly sensitive. And disrupting this policy could have a disruptive effect on our ability to work with China in those areas where our interests do align. That reflects the high priority that China places on this policy and on Taiwan.\nI would also point out the United States values the close partner that we have in Taiwan. Certainly, President Obama doesn't view Taiwan as a bargaining chip. This is our ninth largest trading partner in the world and shouldn't be used as a point of leverage. It doesn't end up being good for our relationship with China. It also doesn't end up being good for Taiwan.\nQ: Last, ask you about this notion that some are floating that what's essentially going on -- sort of the false flag point that was made earlier -- is when people talk about hacking by Russia, they talk about this issue or that issue, and even as Ron mentioned, some nine Democrats and I believe one Republican elector are suggesting they'd like to see sort of the intel breakdown of what's happened vis-а-vis the Russian hacking. The long and short of it is people are suggesting that there are some out there who are trying to delegitimize the election of President-elect Trump. Can you understand why they might have that perspective when they look at it broadly through that lens?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would say -- I think what I can account for is the conduct and language that's being used by this White House and by this President of the United States.\nAnd less than 12 hours after the election results were in, President Obama was standing in the Rose Garden committing his administration and his own personal effort to executing a smooth and effective transition for the benefit of the country and so that the Trump administration could get off to a running start.\nA day later, the President of the United States invited President-elect Trump to sit with him in the Oval Office for 90 minutes, talking about a range of important issues. And then in an unprecedented fashion, we invited all of you into the Oval Office to hear directly from the President-elect and the President of the United States as they articulated their shared commitment to a smooth and effective transition.\nSo I think that the actions and words of the President of the United States in the 48 hours after the election I think make clear his commitment to fulfilling his institutional responsibility to give the incoming President the best opportunity to succeed in uniting and leading the country.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to change subjects and ask you about a letter that Neil Eggleston sent to Senators Feinstein and Burr regarding the Senate Torture Report. In that letter he told them that the report is going to be kept in the Presidential Archives but that President Obama instructed the Archivist to keep that material classified for the full 12 years that's allowed under the law. What I want to know is if the report or parts of the report are going to become declassified anyway, why not just make them declassified now? Why wait the 12 years instead?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the important thing to remember here, Jordan, is that a substantial portion of the report has already been declassified, right? That there's an executive summary and other critically important parts of the report having been declassified and released so the American people could consider it.\nWith regard to other aspects of the report, ultimately the intelligence community will have to review the material that's included in that report to determine what can be released. And I certainly think the hope is that there will be an opportunity for the American public to consider the findings of the report and learn some lessons about what kinds of steps we want to take as a country to protect ourselves and how important it is to ensure that those steps are consistent with our values.\nQ: Wouldn't that decision take on a little more urgency given the concern that you've expressed, that the President has expressed, about what President-elect Trump has said about the use of torture? Why not speed up that decision on declassification?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there's ample information included in that report on this topic that has already been declassified. And we've had an opportunity to wage this debate in public on a number of occasions, and I know that there's at least one official that's been nominated to a senior position in the incoming administration who has expressed the same kinds of views that are included in that report about the ineffectiveness of torturing terror suspects.\nGregory.\nQ: The President is going to sign the 21st Century Cures Act in a signing ceremony tomorrow across the street here. Signing ceremonies have been pretty rare of late around here. President Obama has actually done fewer than his immediate predecessors, especially in the last couple of years. Is that an indication that the President feels that the legislative accomplishments during his presidency haven't been worth celebrating?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think it's an indication that there's been very little passed by Congress under Republican leadership that's worthy of a signing ceremony. Not going to have a signing ceremony for a post office naming.\nAnd when you take a look at what Congress has passed, you can do it pretty quickly. I know there are a variety of ways to measure the ineffectiveness of a particular Congress, and there are a variety of metrics that you can use to show that Republican -- that this most recent Republican-led Congress has been as ineffectual as any in history.\nOne metric for that is to actually take a look at the bills that President Obama has vetoed. And we can get you the specific metrics, but there aren't many. It's not as if Republicans use their significant majorities in the House and Senate to pass bills cracking down on illegal immigration, or slashing business tax cuts, or slashing business taxes, or slashing taxes for wealthy people -- all things that Republicans claim that they support and campaigned on getting done.\nNo, what Republicans have done is they have passed a handful of bills that do nothing other than strip away Obama administration initiatives. So President Obama, for example, had to veto a bill passed through reconciliation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. Republicans passed legislation that would have repealed regulations governing clean air and clean water and labor regulations. They're not advancing their own agenda, they're just trying to take away the President's.\nAnd I think this underscores the intellectual vacuum at the center of the Republican Party right now. It's how they succeeded in nominating and electing a President that many of them doubt shares their conservative philosophy. We'll see. And in fact, the only bill that President Obama has signed and has been overridden by Republicans in Congress is a bill that Republicans tried to fix that same day to address the concerns that President Obama had raised in vetoing the bill -- \"immediate-onset buyer's remorse,\" one smart political operative labeled it.\nI think it's an indication of just how bankrupt the Republican governing agenda has been. There isn't one. And I think the fact that there have not been many signing ceremonies and not been many vetoes is as clear an indication as any.\nQ: Well, obviously, there's two actors in this, right? There's the President and there's Congress, and they have to work together in most cases, unless you have a super majority, to get anything done. But historians tend to look at presidencies for their body of legislation. So can you talk a little bit about what President Obama, over these past eight years -- since this may well be the last -- certainly one of the last bills he's going to sign, probably the last he'll do so publicly -- what is the President most proud of as a legislative accomplishment? And is he disappointed, looking back, that he was not able to fulfill many of the promises legislatively that he set out to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's no doubt that the President has been deeply disappointed at the lack of effort put forward by Republicans to try to find common ground where it actually exists. The President has been profoundly disappointed that Republicans in the House of Representatives blocked consideration of a bipartisan immigration reform bill that would have passed had it come up for a vote. But House Republicans made a cynical political decision to prevent that bill from even being considered. And the President is quite disappointed by that.\nI will say, though, overall, when you consider the kind of legislative progress that we were able to make when Democrats were in charge of the Congress, the President's resume looks quite strong. Even when viewed over the span of eight years, that was a remarkably productive two-year period. Everything from the Recovery Act that contributed to the President's strategy to prevent a second Great Depression; the Affordable Care Act that expanded access to health care for 20 million Americans; a reform of Wall Street that has ensured that taxpayers are never on the hook for bailing out a Wall Street bank for making risky bets. But in the time since the Wall Street reform bill has been signed into law, we've seen a remarkable, impressive economic growth, job creation and increase in the stock market.\nSo those are three examples off the top of my head. There's one other example that I think is also relevant here. In 2012, while Republicans did have a majority in the House, President Obama did succeed in doing something that Republicans had blocked for almost 20 years, and that's getting them to raise income taxes. But Congress did vote to raise income taxes on the wealthiest Americans in the lame duck period after the 2012 election. And that was the fulfillment of a promise that President Obama had made on the campaign trail, and that has had a positive impact on our deficit. It's had a positive impact on the notion of a fairness in our tax code. And it's had positive benefits for our economy.\nAnd we can run -- I'll spare you running through sort of the metrics that we can use to evaluate the wisdom of this strategy, but when the incoming administration lays out their economic strategy, I hope you will go back and take a close look at the impact, the strength that the American economy enjoyed under President Obama's leadership and see if the performance of the next administration measures up.\nQ: Josh, this tomorrow's signing, the last -- is that the last bill that the President is going to sign in public?\nMR. EARNEST: I would expect it will be the last bill that he signs in public, but maybe they'll pass something quickly and interesting after -- when they return in January. But I don't anticipate that will happen.\nMaggie.\nQ: Circling back to the Presidential Daily Briefing. Do you think that the incoming President has any reason to doubt the intelligence during that briefing? Has President Obama every questioned some of the intelligence that happens during the Presidential Daily Briefing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, Maggie, the people who are presenting the briefing are people who are seasoned intelligence professionals. They're experts in their field. In some cases, they are individuals who have a remarkable educational background or academic background in a particular field, or they're experts in technology.\nThe intelligence professionals who compile the Presidential Daily Briefing work very hard to do so. And the do so without a lot of glamour. They don't do so in the limelight. But they ensure that the President has the most accurate, up-to-date information possible in order to make good decisions about the country and our national security.\nThere certainly are occasions where the President wants to have a discussion about some of the CIA findings or the findings from the intelligence community to understand why they've reached certain conclusions or why they're putting forward some analysis. And that does mean that the President is asking questions, and then the intelligence community is coming back to him to further explain what is being presented. But the President has never doubted the motives of the people who are presenting that information. And that's because the President has insisted that the intelligence that's presented to him should be accurate and up to date, and not influenced by politics, and not presented in a way that seeks to curry favor with the person receiving the briefing. If the news is bad somewhere in the world, the President wants to know, so that we can have an opportunity to try to address it.\nThat's why I think it's particularly important that intelligence professionals, as they have been under the Obama administration, understand that they're not going to face retribution just because they present some bad news. In some ways, that's the whole point of the exercise, is to make sure that the President understands the dangerous and threatening things that could be happening around the world so that we can properly orient our defenses to protect the American people.\nQ: If this intelligence is so important to helping shape President Obama's decisions around the globe -- President-elect Trump is having a very public rift with the CIA right now. How detrimental is that to him coming in as President, and is that something that we should be concerned about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let the President-elect work to establish his own relationship with the intelligence community. I can just tell you that President Obama has benefitted enormously from the hardworking professionals at the intelligence community who literally work through the night to provide him the most up-to-date, accurate information in the morning so that he can spend his day making decisions that are rooted in that information. The decisions and the outcomes are going to be better if the President has access to accurate information. And that's certainly the expectation that he has for the intelligence community, and they've delivered.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just three quick questions before the sun starts setting here. (Laughter.)\nQ: Three?\nQ: When you mentioned -- in all the discussion we've had about the Russian hacking, you also mentioned certain ties to Russia within the Trump campaign. You mentioned that Donald Trump didn't disclose financial ties to Russia, that he had at one point called on Putin to look into Hillary Clinton's emails. Did you put those out there as a suggestion that it is possible that there were ties to this hack within the Trump campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I observed these facts because they seem relevant to the judgment that people might draw upon as they assess the impact of Russia's malicious cyber activity. These are objective facts that were not produced by the White House or the intelligence community. They don't require a special security clearance. They don't require any special knowledge that's found anywhere other than in the newspaper or on cable TV.\nSo I don't have a new intelligence assessment to present. But there certainly is ample information for people to consider to draw their own conclusions about what Russia's motivations may have been in undertaking this unprecedented malicious cyber activity.\nQ: So you're saying they seem relevant based on Russia's potential motivations, and not going the other way?\nMR. EARNEST: When you say going the other way, what do you mean?\nQ: That you're not suggesting that they're relevant because there could be a possibility that there was some working together there.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to that. What I'm merely presenting is as people consider this question that Ayesha asked me about whether or not Russia was seeking intentionally to benefit the Trump campaign. My response is I don't have an assessment from the intelligence community to share with you. But there's ample information that people can and should use that was available before the election that doesn't require a security clearance that will allow people to reach their own conclusions.\nQ: Okay. And you mentioned that -- when we talked about Donald Trump saying that there's no evidence that Russia was behind this hack, your response was that there shouldn't be a question there. But what is the administration's take on the fact that he does repeatedly say this regardless?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't want to get into a place where there are charges and counter-charges being traded between the President-elect's team and the President's team, because our most important priority right now is trying to fulfill our institutional obligation to ensure a smooth and effective transition.\nSo you have the argument that's put forward by the President-elect, and you have the statement that was put forward by the intelligence community two months ago revealing their unanimous conclusion that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity in an attempt to destabilize our political system.\nQ: Do you see any risk in those statements that are repeatedly made publicly?\nMR. EARNEST: Which statements are you referring to?\nQ: Donald Trump's statements that there is -- refuting the evidence that the intelligence community has talked about.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there are plenty of concerns I could express about any number of things that the President-elect has said, but the time for those debates has come and gone.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Mark, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks. Josh, on the matter of the PDB, there are some days when there is no PDB listing on this schedule that we receive for the President. Are those days on which he does without a PDB?\nMR. EARNEST: Those are days in which the PDB is presented in writing to the President. And I'll just say in general that there is a mechanism for the kind of feedback that I was referring to earlier, where, if the President has questions or is seeking additional information based on what's presented, there is a mechanism for him to seek that that doesn't require a face-to-face interaction.\nQ: Is that the case on weekends, as well? A written PDB?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I can say most generally is that on the days in which there is not a PDB listed, typically what occurs is the President would receive the PDB in writing or in written format I guess is what --\nQ: President-elect Trump said on Saturday when he was taping the Fox interview that he expected that -- to speak with President Obama that day. Did he?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I've -- as we've encountered in here a few times, I'm going to protect the ability of the President and the President-elect to consult privately.\nQ: But since he mentioned it, can you confirm it?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't confirm it. If the President-elect and his team choose to do that, they're certainly entitled to that. But I'm going to go -- I'm going to do my best to protect the ability of the President and the President-elect to consult privately.\nQ: And lastly, on the question of bill signing, did the President wait up late on Friday night to sign the CR?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that that's how it -- it was signed --\nQ: He signed by hand?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it was signed by hand shortly before he received the official notification that the bill had been signed.\nQ: It was about 10 of 1:00 a.m.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, so it was a late night on Friday night. Okay?\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: All right, thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:25 P.M.

Well, it's Christmas time again. Are we excited about Christmas time? (Applause.)\nMR. SEACREST: Have you all been very, very good this year?\nCHILDREN: Yes.\nMR. SEACREST: Yeah? There's a waver right there. There's a waver.\nMRS. OBAMA: What's going on? Well, we have a story to tell you -- a story about Christmas night and this guy named --\nMR. SEACREST: Old St. Nick.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's about you!\nMR. SEACREST: Santa. About that man right there.\nMRS. OBAMA: So Ryan and I are going to read together. You guys ready?\n'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.\nMR. SEACREST: The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. You're busy.\nSANTA: Very busy.\nMRS. OBAMA: The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads. And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winter's nap.\nMR. SEACREST: When out on the lawn there rose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\nMRS. OBAMA: Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave a luster of midday to objects below.\nMR. SEACREST: When what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.\nMRS. OBAMA: With a little old driver so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.\nMR. SEACREST: More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, this is where the props come in. (Laughter.)\nMR. SEACREST: Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On Comet! On Cupid --\nSANTA: On Donner and Blitzen.\nMR. SEACREST: There you go. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Well done. So glad you brought that. (Laughter.)\nTo the top of the porch, to the top of the wall, now dash away, dash away, dash away all. As the dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky.\nMR. SEACREST: So up to the housetop the coursers they flew, with a sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.\nMRS. OBAMA: And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\nMR. SEACREST: He was dressed in all fur from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.\nMRS. OBAMA: A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes, how they twinkled; his dimples, how merry. His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.\nMR. SEACREST: His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.\nMRS. OBAMA: The stump of a pipe -- I think St. Nick gave up smoking. (Laughter.) This was a long time back.\nMR. SEACREST: This was written way back in the day.\nMRS. OBAMA: But way back in the day.\nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.\nMR. SEACREST: He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.\nSANTA: Ho, ho, ho, ho.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, that's -- I love that laugh.\nMR. SEACREST: I mean this as a compliment: He was chubby and plump -- (laughter) -- a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.\nMRS. OBAMA: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\nMR. SEACREST: He spoke not a word but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk. And laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.\nMRS. OBAMA: He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.\nMR. SEACREST: But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\nMRS. OBAMA: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. (Applause.) Well done. Well done, Ryan. That's good.\nMR. SEACREST: Thank you. Thank you.\nQ: Thank you for that, that was just absolutely wonderful. Mrs. Obama --\nMRS. OBAMA: We're not going anywhere.\nQ: -- we're so pleased and so thrilled to have you here again this year. It's such an honor and such a treat for all the children, for our staff, for our families and for our volunteers to have you visit every year. You've truly been an inspiration for all of us who are involved here at Children's National.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you. It's been an honor for eight years to be here with you.\nQ: And, Ryan, it's such a great treat to have you here today too. Starting to feel like you're part of the family, it's great.\nMR. SEACREST: Happy to be part of the family.\nQ: We get to have you come every month. (Applause.)\nMR. SEACREST: Thank you.\nQ: Now I understand you might be willing to take a few questions from the kids?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah. This is a tough crowd so brace yourself, Ryan.\nMR. SEACREST: Okay, I'm ready.\nQ: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Doctor Newman, who will lead this.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right.\nMR. SEACREST: Thank you.\nDR. NEWMAN: Okay, who has a question? Right over here.\nQ: Mrs. Obama, what did you get the President for Christmas?\nMR. SEACREST: Oh, good question.\nMRS. OBAMA: This is always a tough one because they air this session before Christmas --\nMR. SEACREST: So don't tell.\nMRS. OBAMA: -- and I sort of don't want him to know. But one thing has to do with music, and another thing has to do with sports. Okay? That's all I'm going to tell you.\nMR. SEACREST: What did you get him last year?\nMRS. OBAMA: What did I get -- I think golfing clothes.\nMR. SEACREST: Golfing clothes?\nMRS. OBAMA: There's usually some golfing clothes in there, yeah.\nMR. SEACREST: Good question.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, very good question.\nQ: All right, we have a question over here for you, Ryan.\nQ: What is the best gift you ever received?\nMR. SEACREST: What's the best gift I've ever received? The gift of friendship.\nAUDIENCE: Awww.\nMRS. OBAMA: Awww.\nMR. SEACREST: True.\nMRS. OBAMA: But what's the best stuff you've gotten? (Laughter.)\nMR. SEACREST: Okay, the real -- the best stuff? I got this really cool watch the other day. (Laughter.) My family, honestly, is a family who loves to eat. So we usually just get together Christmas -- we give gifts because we're grown up now, but we just love to eat on holidays.\nMRS. OBAMA: What's your favorite thing to eat?\nMR. SEACREST: I like fondue.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, I love fondue too.\nMR. SEACREST: I like fondue. Yeah, we don't do it often, but we do it Christmas Eve.\nMRS. OBAMA: You guys know what fondue is? We shouldn't talk about -- it's melted cheese, and you stick bread and meat and fruit in it.\nMR. SEACREST: You cook your own food at the table.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, yeah. Try it. It's great. (Laughter.)\nDR. NEWMAN: We've got one question -- I'm looking for the -- where's the microphone? Raise your hand, who's got the microphone. Right where -- here.\nQ: Okay. Mrs. Obama, do you ever get to cook dinner in the White House kitchens?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, I could. (Laughter.) I could. I would be lying -- I have the freedom to do whatever I want. Have I cooked? No, not so much. (Laughter.) Stay here, Sunny.\nI like to cook, but we -- the White House has chefs, and they are much better cooks than me. So I sort of let the people who are good at what they do do that, and then I do other things -- like come here and hang out with you.\nMR. SEACREST: If you did cook, what's your favorite dish to cook?\nMRS. OBAMA: My specialty is -- I've got this shrimp and garlic linguine with sundried tomatoes. It's really good. My family was sick of it because I cooked it a lot, so my kids were like, oh, it's the linguine pasta thing again. (Laughter.) But that's my favorite dish, and it's really, really good. It's really good.\nDR. NEWMAN: We have another question right there.\nQ: This is for Ryan. What did you ask for this Christmas?\nMR. SEACREST: What did I ask for this Christmas?\nMRS. OBAMA: And don't say peace on Earth. (Laughter.)\nMR. SEACREST: No, I'm not. I'm not.\nSANTA: I know what he asked for.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh right, that's right. You can't tell. Of course Santa knows.\nMR. SEACREST: I haven't even gotten around to asking yet. I'm thinking about it now for the first time. I need to learn how to play an instrument, so I'm going to ask for a guitar and I'm going to learn how to play. I feel like I work in the music world, I should be learn how to play an instrument.\nSo, Meredith, if you're listening -- my sister is here.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh yeah.\nMR. SEACREST: There you go. Tell Santa please, Mer.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. But then you need lessons too.\nMR. SEACREST: Oh yeah, and lessons, please.\nDR. NEWMAN: Another question right over here.\nQ: Okay. So this is for Ryan. What's your favorite holiday song?\nMR. SEACREST: Favorite holiday?\nMRS. OBAMA: Holiday song, did you --\nMR. SEACREST: Favorite holiday song? I like -- my favorite holiday song for Christmas time is \"Silent Night.\" The candlelight service, light the candle and sing that with everybody's candle lit. That's my favorite holiday song.\nMRS. OBAMA: And it has to have the candle to -- going with it?\nMR. SEACREST: Yeah, you've got to light the candle on that.\nMRS. OBAMA: I like \"This Christmas.\" \"Shake your hand, shake your hand.\" (Laughter.)\nMR. SEACREST: Also, that Mariah Carey song is pretty good too, \"All I Want For Christmas.\"\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, yeah, that's a good one.\nMR. SEACREST: \"All I Want For Christmas.\"\nMRS. OBAMA: What's the top Christmas song?\nMR. SEACREST: That's the number-one song in the nation when it comes to Christmas time.\nMRS. OBAMA: Mariah's song?\nMR. SEACREST: Mariah's \"All I Want For Christmas.\" The biggest Christmas song on the charts.\nMRS. OBAMA: Really? Bigger than --\nMR. SEACREST: I'm going to sell it. Yes, yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay, okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: Hi, Mrs. Obama, we have a question over here for you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay.\nQ: Mrs. Obama --\nDR. NEWMAN: Last question.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh!\nDR. NEWMAN: Well, maybe one more after this.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, seems so short. (Laughter.)\nQ: Mrs. Obama, are Sunny and Bo allowed to walk around the entire White House or just the residence?\nMRS. OBAMA: No, they walk around everywhere. And one of the things they do is they go into the Oval if it's hot outside -- Bo doesn't like extreme weather, because he's kind of furry. So if they're outside and it's hot, he, like, goes up to the Oval Office and he kind of paws until they open the door, and he comes and he sits in -- he has a favorite chair by the TV in the outer office. So he has his spots.\nSo they're all over the place. Their favorite person in the White House is Dale, who's the gardener. Dale is back there. And he hangs out with them. So he comes and gets them in the morning -- they have a regular routine. So, like, after they eat, about 7:30, 8:00, he comes to get them and they walk around the White House. And they do errands with him, and they hang out with the gardeners. Then they'll, like, make some appearances.\nI actually have a whole request sheet just for them. (Laughter.) So my in my daily briefing book, you get a whole set of requests -- can Bo and Sunny take pictures with this group, and this ambassador is coming in and they made a request to see Sunny and Bo. And I have to approve it. (Laughter.) So they have a full schedule. And they got all fluffed up for you guys today. We usually make sure they get cleaned before this visit and fluffed up.\nSo they're very busy. They are excellent ambassadors. They're probably the most popular living creatures in the White House. (Laughter.)\nDR. NEWMAN: Right there, another question.\nQ: Do Sunny and Bo unwrap their own gifts?\nMRS. OBAMA: Do they unwarp their own gifts? No, no. They're bright but not that bright. (Laughter.) They get gifts, but they don't unwrap them on their own, because I don't want them to eat the paper. So we'll bring -- they each get a set of toys, and we'll lay them out so that they know it's theirs. But they're pretty good about not picking up stuff that they don't have permission to pick up. They're really good about that.\nBut they get gifts every year, not to worry. They will -- right, Santa?\nMR. SEACREST: They'll do just fine.\nMRS. OBAMA: But let's not discuss what they're getting because they're here.\nDR. NEWMAN: Here's our last question.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay.\nQ: Do you and President Obama work together?\nMRS. OBAMA: Do we what?\nQ: Work together at the White House?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, we do work together. We work together on a whole range of things. One of the things we've worked together -- is not just me and the President, but the Vice President, Joe Biden, and his wife, Jill Biden -- the four of us work very hard on supporting our servicemembers and our military families. So we do a lot of events like that together. And it's fun having your husband hanging around with you all day. (Applause.)\nGreat questions, guys!\nMR. SEACREST: Good job, guys.\nQ: Well, thank you all very much for being here. And we just have to, first of all, thank Ryan Seacrest for the amazing studio he and his family put together. (Applause.) And we have these studios in nine or 10 other children's hospitals, so it's really an amazing thing.\nAnd then, Mrs. Obama, what can we say? We've just loved having you here over the last eight years. We're glad you're going to stay in Washington at least two more years. (Applause.) And we look forward to having her back here at Children's National. And don't forget, she's a hospital executive before she became First Lady, so I can always put her to work. (Laughter.) I know she's got a lot of great things to do.\nSo again, thank you so much for being with us here at the holiday time.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thanks so much.

And we've got Jade, and Callum, and Jaquan, and Freddy also at the mics. Is this your first time on the air, Jade?\nQ: Yes, it is. (Laughter.)\nQ: All right, well, I will start with the first question, and then each of you guys I think --\nMRS. OBAMA: Don't make them too hard. I'm a little nervous.\nQ: Well, I'll ask you -- just think -- we were talking about Christmas and Christmas Eve -- New Year's is coming. Have you made your resolution?\nMRS. OBAMA: No, I have not. I have not had time to really think about it, because the holidays are so -- I totally forgot about New Year's Eve resolutions, so I have to think about that. What about you guys? Do you guys do resolutions?\nQ: Yeah, definitely.\nMRS. OBAMA: Tell me some -- give me -- maybe you can give me some ideas.\nQ: My resolution for 2017 is to work on my mental health and make it -- improve it, because that's something that's really been difficult for me this past year. So definitely --\nMRS. OBAMA: Sounds good. That sounds good.\nQ: Well, the first step to that is a big smile, and you've got that.\nMRS. OBAMA: I know, you do. You do. What about you guys? Any New Year's resolutions?\nQ: Nope.\nQ: I guess my resolution is to get more socially and politically involved in, like, causes that I believe in.\nMRS. OBAMA: How old are you?\nQ: Seventeen.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, you're about at that age where you -- it all makes sense to you. What about you?\nQ: My resolution is, like everyone else's, to be more social, and probably to lose weight and be healthy.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right, that's always a good one. Always a good one.\nQ: Well, do you want to start with the questions, Jade? What's your question?\nQ: Yeah. Okay, so the first question --\nMRS. OBAMA: First of all, I have to say, eyebrows on fleek. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you so much.\nMRS. OBAMA: I am noticing. Yeah, uh-huh.\nQ: I worked very hard on them, so I appreciate it.\nMRS. OBAMA: I can tell.\nQ: Thank you. I really like your eyebrows too.\nMRS. OBAMA: Just the important things. (Laughter.)\nQ: Eyebrows on fleek.\nQ: Yeah, as long as your eyebrows are on fleek, nothing else really matters.\nMRS. OBAMA: Then you feel good.\nQ: Exactly. The eyebrows are the actual eyes to the soul. (Laughter.)\nSo the first question is, what is your favorite winter activity?\nMRS. OBAMA: I love to ski. I do, I do. And since I've been First Lady I ski a little bit more -- because we don't get to get outside. When you're President and First Lady, our lives are really -- we live in a bubble. We go from the White House, which is basically hermetically sealed -- (laughter) -- because there's bomb-proof glass, you can't open the windows. We can go outside, but going outside and just walking around and being in fresh air -- because if we go outside, then everybody sees us, they stop, the security is -- it just get messy and complicated, not just for us but for people -- we interrupt their days, and it gets to be a hassle.\nBut when I'm skiing, that's, like, one of the few places in the winter where I feel free. Because nobody can take a selfie with you when you're skiing down a mountain, no matter how -- (laughter) -- some are really good, but they generally can't whip out the phone and catch you when you're going down.\nSo skiing for me is like golfing to the President. One of the reasons why the President golfs so much, it's one of the few opportunities he has to be outside, walking around like a normal person for long periods of time. And skiing does that for me in the winter. And it's great exercise. And it's fun. And it's a little scary too, all at the same time.\nHas anybody here ever skied before?\nQ: I have not skied. I really want to, though. It looks like a lot of fun.\nQ: You're pretty good.\nMRS. OBAMA: I'm a solid intermediate.\nQ: Solid intermediate?\nMRS. OBAMA: Solid.\nQ: I've heard you're really great.\nMRS. OBAMA: I don't do moguls. I don't see the point in that. That seems a little scary. (Laughter.)\nQ: I like intermediate trails as well.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, I enjoy those.\nQ: It's nice.\nMRS. OBAMA: So that's one thing you guys can do, is like organize a ski trip. Where's our hospital officials? (Laughter.) I say ski trip! Yeah. (Laughter.)\nQ: How about you, Callum?\nQ: Yeah. So, Mrs. Obama, do you have a special set of Christmas pajamas?\nMRS. OBAMA: I don't. (Laughter.) That's another good thing. You know, my kids are at the age where they think stuff like that is corny. And I think if you have Christmas pajamas, they should be family Christmas pajamas. So I couldn't get the President to wear cute Christmas pajamas, and Malia and Sasha definitely would not be down for cute Christmas pajamas. So I would be the only one in them, and then they would tease me and I would be upset. (Laughter.) But I'm going to think about that.\nQ: My mother makes us wear them. At Christmas morning, my mom puts my dad, myself, and my sister and her in the same pajamas. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Do they have the footies in them?\nQ: They have the footies.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, man, that's so cute.\nQ: It's as corny as it can get.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right.\nMS. SEACREST: With socks too.\nQ: Oh, and socks.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, and socks. That's Ryan's sister. She can tell us all the embarrassing things. (Laughter.) You should do a selfie of that, send that out.\nQ: Yeah, we should send that out. All right, Jaquan, go ahead.\nQ: Jaquan.\nQ: Jaquan, sorry.\nQ: What is your favorite Santa reindeer?\nMRS. OBAMA: My favorite of all time is Rudolph with his nose so bright. I'm not going to sing. (Laughter.) But Rudolph -- I have a special place in my heart for Rudolph, primarily because of the Rudolph reindeer Christmas show that comes on with those animated claymation -- those were my favorite. That's what made Christmas. When those came on, oh, you knew it was Christmas. And Rudolph was my favorite one, when he had to hide his nose, and he sounded like this. And his girlfriend Clarice, and the Abominable Snowman, and their adventure. It was heartbreaking. (Laughter.) But then he made it back home. It was touching.\nQ: I feel like it's going to be on the air very soon.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's already been on. They start that -- they do Christmas --\nQ: They start at Halloween.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah. And then the other one is Charlie Brown Christmas. That's a good one.\nQ: Freddy, you've got the stage.\nQ: Were Sunny and Bo naughty or nice this year?\nMRS. OBAMA: They were very nice. You see how patient they are. And I told you, they are excellent ambassadors. They are very good. And Sunny has stopped running to the end of the hall and pooping. (Laughter.) She hasn't done that all year.\nThat was a naughty thing she was doing for a couple of years, because the White House, where we live, it's very long, right? So they usually spend time on what's the west end of the residence, right? The east end is like way down there, so I think she thinks that's, like, outside. So if she would get out of her area, she'd run and she'd sneak and go down there and poop. (Laughter.) And she knew she shouldn't do it because she'd have to go by the President's office, and if he saw her he'd be like, \"Hey, Sunny!\" And she'd try to ignore him and look -- her head down. (Laughter.)\nShe hasn't done that for a good year, so we're hoping that she's done with that.\nQ: Now, do they have little beds where they sleep?\nMRS. OBAMA: They sleep in their crates at night. They could sleep outside but they -- when we first got Sunny, Bo used to sleep with Malia, and then Malia went to camp when we got Sunny. So Bo and Sunny were sleeping together. And she said, well, I want Bo to sleep with me, and so she took him, but he left her room and just fell asleep right by Sunny's crate. So he didn't want to leave her. So we started putting them both in crates.\nSo they have little homes. And they travel in their crates sometimes.\nQ: They're spoiled a little bit. They're spoiled a little.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, of course. They're the White House dogs. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, good questions, all of you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Very good questions.\nQ: Thank you very much for spending some time with us. And we wish you a happy holiday, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year -- all that good stuff.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you. Yay! Thank you, Ryan.\nQ: Michelle Obama, thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you so much. You guys, great questions. Well done.

The Strategy relies on the existing strong bilateral collaboration between the United States and Canada and reflects a joint commitment and a shared approach to risk management for the electric grid. It also articulates a common vision of a future electric grid that depends on effective and expanded collaboration among those who own, operate, protect, and rely on it. Because the electric grid is vital to the functioning of modern society and dependent on other infrastructure for its function, the United States and Canada developed the Strategy under the shared principle that security and resilience require increased collaboration and shared approaches to risk management.\nThe Strategy envisions a secure and resilient electric grid that is able to withstand hazards and recover efficiently from disruptions. In pursuit of this goal, the Strategy describes joint approaches to protect today's electric grid, manage contingencies by enhancing response and recovery capabilities, and cultivate a more secure and resilient future electric grid.\nThree strategic goals underpin the effort to strengthen the security and resilience of the electric grid:\n•      Protect Today's Electric Grid and Enhance Preparedness: A secure and resilient electric grid that protects system assets and critical functions and is able to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions is a priority for the governments of both the United States and Canada.\n•      Manage Contingencies and Enhance Response and Recovery Efforts: The Strategy sets out a shared approach for enhancing continuity and response capabilities, supporting mutual aid arrangements such as cyber mutual assistance across a diverse set of stakeholders, understanding interdependencies, and expanding available tools for recovery and rebuilding.\n•      Build a More Secure and Resilient Future Electric Grid: The United States and Canada are working to build a more secure and resilient electric grid that is responsive to a variety of threats, hazards, and vulnerabilities, including increased threats from climate change. To achieve this, the electric grid will need to be more flexible and agile, with an architecture into which new technologies may be readily incorporated.\nThe Strategy will be implemented in accordance with separate U.S. and Canadian Action Plans, each detailing specific steps and milestones for achieving the Strategy's goals within each nation. The National Electric Grid Security and Resilience Action Plan may be found  here. These documents are intended to guide future activity within areas of Federal jurisdiction, with full respect for the jurisdictional authorities of both countries.", "timestamp": "2016-12-12", "title": "Fact Sheet: Release of the Joint United States-Canada Electric Grid Security and Resilience Strategy"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122607", "text": "President Obama announced during his March 2016 visit to Argentina that the United States would embark on a comprehensive effort to identify additional records related to human rights abuses committed under Argentina's dictatorship. In a ceremony to commemorate the victims of the dictatorship at the Parque de la Memoria in Buenos Aires, President Obama said, \"to continue helping the families of the victims find some of the truth and justice they deserve, I can announce that the U.S. Government will declassify even more documents from that period including, for the first time, military and intelligence records, because I believe we have a responsibility to confront the past with honesty and transparency.\"\nThe declassification project represents an historic effort by U.S. Government agencies and departments to search, identify, review for public access, and provide records that shed light on human rights abuses in Argentina between 1975 and 1984. In 2002, the United States declassified over 4,000 State Department cables and other documents from the period of the Argentine military dictatorship. These records have helped Argentina hold human rights abusers accountable, for example, by supporting Argentine criminal investigations into human rights violations under the dictatorship.\nThis additional effort – requested by Argentine President Mauricio Macri and human rights groups – involves over 14 U.S. Government agencies and departments, including for the first time the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Archives and Records Administration and the archives of four Presidential Libraries, as well as several components of the Department of Defense, including the military departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Defense Intelligence Agency.\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry delivered an initial set of 1,000 declassified records to President Macri on August 4, 2016. This second set totals approximately 500 newly declassified records. Many reside at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, but there are also records from the Presidential Libraries of Gerald R. Ford, Ronald W. Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, including a small set of documents produced after 1984. These records, alongside the documents released earlier in 2016, are available to the public at www.icontherecord.tumblr.com, and will also be made available in hard copy at each of the relevant Presidential Libraries. This set also includes portions of the President's Daily Briefs from the Carter and Reagan administrations, in the first significant release of CIA presidential briefing documents from these administrations.\nThe United States provided these documents to the Government of Argentina today as part of Argentina's commemoration of the work and life of an American diplomat, Patricia Derian, who served as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs from 1977-1981, and who passed away in May 2016. Derian was a tireless advocate for human rights, and her work is reflected in many of these documents, including several that she personally drafted that addressed the detention, torture, and disappearance of Argentine civilians at the hands of the dictatorship. In recognition of her dedication to human rights, Argentina honored Derian in 2006 with its highest award for a foreign government official, the Order of the Liberator General San Martнn. In today's commemoration, Argentina will further honor Derian by placing a plaque with her name at the Archivo Nacional de la Memoria.\nThis ongoing declassification project, led by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence (ODNI) with support from the White House and Executive branch agencies, involves hundreds of hours of agency staff resources, including records managers, archivists, historians, and declassification and information access professionals. U.S. Government officials are searching records for relevant information to review for potential public release. The reviews of these records are on a \"word-for-word\" basis – a more exacting and revealing process than the typical reviews agencies conduct on their historical records when they release or withhold entire records on a \"pass-fail\" basis.\nU.S. Government agencies are conducting this declassification effort through five major tasks. With the public release of documents today, the first two tasks are complete:\n•      Make records from the Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald W. Reagan, and George H.W. Bush Presidential Libraries available to the public. Records from the Presidential Libraries are of great historical interest, given their importance in documenting U.S. decision-making at the highest level. Archivists at the four Presidential Libraries searched their holdings for relevant classified documents and provided them for interagency review. In addition to the records of Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan, archivists also identified several documents from Vice President George H.W. Bush's files at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library.\n•      Make responsive portions from the President's Daily Brief (PDB) available to the public. The PDBs are considered the Intelligence Community's most important product, providing information on the most significant global national security issues. The release of the relevant portions of these PDBs is only the 3rd time in history PDBs have been declassified, and the first-ever Carter-era and Reagan-era PDBs publicly released.\nU.S. Government agencies continue their work on the three remaining tasks:\n•      Make previously withheld information from the Department of State's 2002 declassification project available to the public. While the Department of State declassified its cables and records that provided evidence of human rights abuses, it withheld some information for national security classification or statutory-based restrictions. The Department of State and other relevant agencies will re-review these cables and records in an effort to publicly release additional information. This re-review is expected to be completed in early 2017.\n•      The U.S. Government will make available to the public records related to human rights abuses that occurred between 1975 and 1984 in Argentina. This will be a comprehensive search of hundreds of federal records series and hundreds of thousands of pages to identify relevant individual documents for review and potential release. The ODNI will coordinate an interagency public access review of relevant records. This review is expected to be complete in late 2017.\n•      Make the 1977-1981 Foreign Relations of the United States South America volume available to the public. The Historian's Office at the Department of State is expediting publication of this volume, with the goal of publishing the Argentina and Regional Issues chapters by late 2017.\nThese newly declassified records represent a continued commitment by the United States to promote justice and reconciliation in Argentina, to underscore the importance of transparency, and to highlight our shared commitment to human rights. These records represent the second step in a lengthy and ambitious declassification process.", "timestamp": "2016-12-12", "title": "Fact Sheet: Argentina Declassification Project"}

Guiding operations around the world that include more than 200 offices, Mr. Tillerson knows how to manage a global organization and successfully navigate the complex architecture of world affairs and diverse foreign leaders. As Secretary of State, he will be a forceful and clear-eyed advocate for America's vital national interests, and help reverse years of misguided foreign policies and actions that have weakened America's security and standing in the world. The American people will once again have a world-class leader working on their behalf, enhancing the prospects for peace and prosperity among nations.\n\"Rex Tillerson's career is the embodiment of the American dream. Through hard work, dedication and smart deal making, Rex rose through the ranks to become CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest and most respected companies,\" said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \"His tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for Secretary of State. He will promote regional stability and focus on the core national security interests of the United States. Rex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none. I can think of no one more prepared, and no one more dedicated, to serve as Secretary of State at this critical time in our history.\"\n\"I am honored by President-elect Trump's nomination and share his vision for restoring the credibility of the United States' foreign relations and advancing our country's national security,\" said Mr. Tillerson. \"We must focus on strengthening our alliances, pursuing shared national interests and enhancing the strength, security and sovereignty of the United States.\"\nRex Tillerson is a native Texan who earned a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. He began his career at Exxon Company, U.S.A. in 1975 as a production engineer.\nAfter years of hard work and dedication to his company, Rex then became general manager of Exxon Company, U.S.A.'s central production division, responsible for oil and gas production operations throughout a large portion of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas.\nIn 1992, Mr. Tillerson was named production advisor to Exxon Corporation. Three years later he was named president of Exxon Yemen Inc. and Esso Exploration and Production Khorat Inc., and in January 1998, he was promoted to vice president of Exxon Ventures (CIS) Inc. and president of Exxon Neftegas Limited. In those roles, he was responsible for Exxon's holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea as well as the Sakhalin I consortium operations offshore Sakhalin Island, Russia.\nIn December 1999, he became executive vice president of Exxon Mobil Development Company. Mr. Tillerson was then named senior vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation in August 2001, and was elected president of the corporation and member of the board of directors on March 1, 2004. Nearly two years after he was elected, Mr. Tillerson was named as chairman and CEO of the board on January 1, 2006.\nMr. Tillerson is not only a stalwart in his professional life, but also in the community. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He is the vice chairman of the Ford's Theatre Society and a recipient of the Lincoln Medal; immediate past national president of the Boy Scouts of America, a Distinguished Eagle Scout, and a former director of the United Negro College Fund.

Groomed for an executive position, Tillerson came up in the rough-and-tumble world of oil production, holding posts in the company's central United States, Yemen and Russian operations.\n...\nIn 2006, Tillerson won the battle to succeed former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond. Under the Texan's leadership, oil prices broke records and Exxon's profits helped make it the most valuable public company in the world, with a security force totaling thousands of employees, direct channels with governments worldwide and a strong aversion to American sanctions or limitations on where it could operate.\nTillerson has used Exxon's enormous profits to explore new regions for oil and gas and to invest in new acquisitions like XTO Resources, a company that had helped pioneer drilling for natural gas in formations of shale in the United States. But over the years oil has become more difficult and expensive to find as large, easy-to-tap reservoirs in stable countries were slowly depleted. Exxon and other giant oil corporations found it ever more difficult to replace the oil they sold every day with new resources, and they were forced to look in every more difficult and hostile regions for oil and gas.\n...\nBut he said it's clear the risks of climate change to society and ecosystems could be significant, and it's prudent to develop and implement \"sensible strategies that address these risks while not reducing our ability to progress other global priorities such as economic development, poverty eradication and public health.\"\n...\nOutside the oil industry, Tillerson has served as director of the United Negro College Fund and as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute.

His selection of Rex Tillerson is another example of recruiting people of extraordinary skill and accomplishment. How refreshing to have people with real world success rather than simply rounding up some academics with big ideas but very small accomplishments. Think tank theorists are useful to design the craft, but to complete the mission, we need people who have actually flown the craft.\"\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush:\n\"In the interview with WJLH, Bush also praised Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state, saying the Exxon Mobile CEO has 'vast experience.' He called Tillerson a 'patriot' who will 'represent the interests of United States really, really well. But (the Senate) will have the chance to discuss all these things in an opening hearing. That's how the process works.'\" Tampa Bay Times\nSenator Jim Inhofe (R-OK):\n\"I am pleased by President-elect Trump's announcement to nominate Rex Tillerson to be our Secretary of State,\" Inhofe said. \"I have known Rex for years and think he will be great for this position. He is an accomplished leader who has proven himself on the world stage as ExxonMobil's CEO. His business acumen will provide a welcomed, fresh look at how the State Department conducts its business, and I am confident he will leverage our global leadership position to strengthen the United States and our allies around the world. I look forward to discussing my national security concerns with him and working closely with him in the coming years.\"\nSenator Johnny Isakson (R-GA):\n\"Mr. Tillerson has an impressive background with unique experience and extensive knowledge of working in a global environment. I congratulate Mr. Tillerson on his nomination, and I look forward to meeting with him during the confirmation process to learn more about how he views the world and America's national interests.\"\nRepresentative Michael Burgess (R-TX):\n\"I commend President-Elect Trump on his nomination of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. This prominent position in the Administration is tasked with the delicate balance of working to ease tensions around the globe while also ensuring U.S. national security and a strong foreign policy agenda. Mr. Tillerson, a constituent on mine in the 26th district of Texas, has worked extensively with foreign leaders cultivating relationships that will only prove to benefit U.S. interest around the world. From the pipelines to platforms, his experience leading the global efforts of one of America's most successful companies has equipped him with the understanding and insight to navigate the current world stage. Congratulations to Mr. Tillerson on this honorable nomination.\"\nAndrew Bowen, American Enterprise Institute:\n\"Rex Tillerson Is A Strong Choice To Be America's Next Top Diplomat.\" Newsweek\nAmerican Petroleum Institute President and CEO Jack Gerard:\n\"Rex Tillerson is world class. He has decades of experience working with global leaders and overseeing the creation of thousands of jobs He understands that American voters want to strengthen our national security, grow jobs, and protect American interests globally.\n\"As our nation's next top diplomat, Rex has the strategic experience to effectively represent the new administration and the American people. He runs one of the largest companies in the world that operates in more than 50 countries, oversees over 75,000 employees, and he has first-hand experience working on international issues. His relationships and in particular those with other nations will help further advance U.S. interests across the globe.\n\"We congratulate Rex on being nominated and look forward to working with him, the incoming administration, and the new Congress on common sense policies that protect the environment, create jobs, and strengthen our economy.\"\nSenator David Perdue (R-GA), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the State Department and USAID Management, International Operations, and Bilateral International Development:\n\"While this may seem like a nontraditional choice, after eight years of foreign policy setbacks, we will need to make some bold changes to help re-establish American leadership and credibility around the world. Rex Tillerson has spent his career overseeing one of our nation's largest companies and growing its presence around the world. As both a business guy and chairman of the subcommittee that oversees State Department management, I look forward to hearing from Mr. Tillerson, examining his goals for the State Department, and learning more about his perspective on the global security crisis we face today.\"\nNational Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons:\n\"President-elect Trump has chosen an expert negotiator to run the business of American diplomacy. A great friend to the National Association of Manufacturers, Rex Tillerson has spent his life making deals and getting results; now he can put his incomparable experience, talents and connections to work on behalf of our entire country. Manufacturers are encouraged to see a leader from the manufacturing economy take on the role of America's chief diplomat, and we are pleased that Rex will bring a business perspective to the State Department.\n\"Beyond his rock star business credentials, Rex has been a staunch force for the dignity and opportunity of all citizens, and will no doubt work to make our nation and our world a better place. For all of his stellar accomplishments, Rex and his wife Renda are incredibly humble, decent and relatable people of the highest character. I wish them both the best in this important endeavor, and much success in the critical work that is ahead for Rex.\"\nNorth America's Building Trades Unions:\n\"For almost a decade, North America's Building Trades Unions have had the opportunity to work closely with Rex Tillerson in his current capacity as the Chief Executive Officer of Exxon Mobil. During that time working directly with him, and also in conjunction with the Oil & Natural Gas Industry Labor-Management Committee, Mr. Tillerson demonstrated a strong intellect, a resilient and dynamic grasp of both global and domestic policy issues, and a deep and unyielding sense of patriotism for our great nation.\n\"Rex Tillerson has successfully shepherded Exxon Mobil through very tumultuous times in terms of global geo-politics. With his intellect, his wit, and his deep understanding and knowledge of the world as it exists today, we believe he will be a tremendous success as Secretary of State, and we offer our full support for his confirmation.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-13", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying....More Praise for Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State"}

Trump today announced his selection of Stephen Miller to serve as Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the President for Policy. Miller has served as a key advisor to several members of Congress, including U.S. Senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions, and served in senior leadership roles on both the Senate Budget Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee.\nMiller has been serving as the President-elect's top advisor on policy since January 2016. As national policy director, he oversaw the entire policy operation, led the policy development and formulation efforts, and directed strategic policy decisions on a day-to-day basis. Miller also served throughout as the campaign's chief speechwriter, and is currently the policy director for the President-elect's Transition Team. As Senior Advisor to the President for Policy, Miller will also be responsible for directing White House policy staff, managing speechwriting functions, and working to ensure the enactment of the President's policy agenda.\n\"Stephen played a central and wide-ranging role in our primary and general election campaign,\" said President-Elect Trump. \"He is deeply committed to the America First agenda, and understands the policies and actions necessary to put that agenda into effect. He is a strong advocate for protecting American workers, and will fulfill a crucial role in my Administration as my senior advisor on matters of policy.\"\n\"Stephen Miller is the best person President-elect Donald Trump could have chosen to be his senior advisor for policy,\" said U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions. \"He has understood the Trump Movement from the beginning and has a unique understanding of the very real and honest concerns of the American people.

Happy Tuesday. As advertised, I'm going to be joined today by Brett McGurk. Brett has been here a couple of times before. Brett just left a National Security Council meeting with the President. The President, as you know, convenes his National Security Council every few weeks to review the progress that we're making against ISIL. Brett participated in the meeting and is now here to provide an update to all of you on that progress.\nBrett's title -- I was asking him just before we walked in -- is Special Presidential Envoy to the Global Coalition Against ISIL. He's got a presentation that he'll offer up and then he'll take some questions. He'll leave and then I can take your questions on non-ISIL-related topics from there.\nSo with that, Brett, do you want to take it away?\nMR. MCGURK: So thanks for having me. I thought I would give an update on the counter-ISIL campaign. The last time I was here I think was about six months ago, and I have a lot of new information, which I'll convey.\nThe President just convened, as Josh mentioned, his National Security Council today to discuss the current status of the global campaign against ISIL. The meeting provided an in-depth overview of where we are in this campaign, and I want to provide just an update overall.\nSo as you know, we analyze ISIL and focus our policy on destroying it in really three dimensions -- its core in Iraq and Syria and shrinking its physical space; its network, so that's foreign fighters, finance and propaganda media networks; and then the so-called affiliates, made of affinities, affiliates around the world, of which Libya has been of particular concern to us.\nThe United States, we have an Integrated Campaign Plan that incorporates our entire government -- Defense, State, Treasury, Justice, Homeland Security, and the intelligence community -- around specific lines of effort. It's called the ICP, and it's an effort we review and refresh really each quarter to help identify opportunities, reinforce areas where we're having success and address areas that may have fallen behind. The President received a detailed update on this ICP this morning.\nWe also, of course, lead a global coalition of 68 members -- this is one of the largest coalitions of its kind in history -- to relentlessly combat ISIL across all lines of effort. So, militarily, on the ground in Iraq and Syria, we're supporting partners with training, equipping, advising and airstrikes. That's 17,455 airstrikes against ISIL terrorists as of this morning.\nThrough law enforcement cooperation, where we're sharing information to find and disrupt plots around the world. Through intelligence, homeland security and other channels to help combat the flow of foreign fighters across borders. Through treasury and finance to destroy ISIL's economic infrastructure. And through both governments and the private sector to combat ISIL's poisonous ideology and their propaganda online, their ability to recruit.\nOur global coalition has also provided billions of dollars to support stabilization in areas cleared of ISIL, enabling citizens to return. And this is not only a U.S. effort; ISIL is an enemy that threatens the entire world, so we have leveraged resources from around the world, including more than $2 billion pledged for humanitarian, stabilization efforts in Iraq during coalition meetings in July.\nBut U.S. leadership matters on this. And that's why I want to thank the Congress for their close coordination in supporting a counter-ISIL budget amendment in the recently passed continuing resolution. These funds will be essential to help us accelerate the campaign and support efforts such as demining that allows people to return to their homes. And I'll be calling on coalition partners to make similar contributions here over the coming days.\nLet me update you briefly on some of the update -- the campaigns we have ongoing now, particularly in Sirte, Libya; and Raqqa and Mosul.\nIn Sirte, about a year ago ISIL controlled approximately 150 kilometers of land on the Mediterranean coastline. It was using Libya as a haven from which to plan attacks in neighboring Tunisia, and ISIL leaders were encouraging people to travel to Libya, instead of Syria, to join ISIL. They saw it as their growing safe haven.\nSince that time, at the President's direction, we've eliminated the mastermind of the Tunisia attacks, Noureddine Chouchane; the leader of ISIL in Libya, Abu Nabil, who came from Syria to lead ISIL in Libya. And now we've just completed operations to liberate Sirte and its surrounding areas. So in Operation Odyssey Lightning, U.S. military forces conducted almost 500 airstrikes in support of units fighting under the authority of Libya's Government of National Accord. And while we've still got work to be done, this strategic location in the Mediterranean is no longer accessible to ISIL terrorists. We'll, of course, continue to support the Government of National Accord as it pursues ISIL throughout the country.\nIn Raqqa -- Raqqa remains ISIL administrative capital and it is under more pressure now than ever before. Forces partnered with our coalition have now entirely severed routes between Raqqa and ISIL locations in Iraq. And the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of local Arabs and Kurds, are steadily advancing on Raqqa with the aim to isolate or really strangulate the city. Since this operation began about one month ago, the SDF has cleared 700 square kilometers north of Raqqa, and just on Saturday began a second phase of operations along the new access just to the west, and this is proceeding quite well.\nThe pressure in Raqqa is bearing fruit as ISIL leaders come out of hiding, which allows us to kill them. Today we confirm the deaths by precision coalition airstrikes of three terrorist leaders in Raqqa -- Salah Gourmat, Sammy Djedou, Walid Hamman.\nGourmat was a French Algerian, Djedou a Belgian. They were responsible for planning and facilitating the November 13th attacks in Paris last year. They were also actively plotting attacks when they were killed on December 4th in the streets of Raqqa. Hamman had been convicted by a Belgian court for a terrorist plot in 2015, and he was working with Gourmat and Djedou to plan new attacks.\nSo these three dead terrorists in Raqqa join a growing list from ISIL's what we call their external operations network that we have targeted and eliminated. Last month, coalition forces eliminated Abd al-Basit al-Iraqi. He was the ISIL emir for attacks throughout the Middle East region and a key facilitator for terrorist travel through Turkey. Coalition strikes also killed Boubaker al-Hakim, an ISIL leader planning attacks in France and throughout Europe. And a leader of all ISIL external operations, of course, Muhammad Adnani, was killed on August 30th as he traveled from Raqqa to Bab.\nSo the point is, even as operations continue to move towards Raqqa, our coalition is relentlessly reaching into Raqqa to eliminate ISIL leaders with a particular focus on those planning and plotting against our homeland and our partners.\nFor the operation to seize and hold Raqqa, which will be coming, we're in close consultation with our partners including Turkey. I was in Ankara last week for talks on this and other topics and these talks were quite fruitful. And the President's authorization over the weekend for an additional 200 Special Operations Forces in Syria will help further accelerate our campaign to eject ISIL from Raqqa. I visited these Special Operators several times and they are doing truly heroic work to protect our homeland and to eliminate this haven of ISIL in Syria.\nAnd I'll briefly discussed the Mosul campaign. We're now in month two of what is really the most complex operation to date -- the liberation of Mosul -- and thus far we've seen a very steady and deliberate advance along all axes against ISIL terrorists, which are using the civilian population in Mosul as human shields.\nI just visited the eastern axis, just in the outskirts of Mosul, last week. Secretary Carter was in Iraq, and he visited the Qayara airbase, south of Mosul, over the weekend. And General Votel, our CENTCOM commander, was in the same area just yesterday and gave a very detailed to the President this morning. And all of us witnessed this unprecedented cooperation between the Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga, which has really been essential to this campaign.\nOur coalition since the beginning of this campaign, about two years ago, we've trained over 65,000 Iraqi personnel who are now fighting professionally and performing heroically. So ISIL terrorists are now trapped in Mosul. They're unable to resupply or replenish their dwindling ranks. Throughout this campaign, which began just a couple months ago now, we've already conducted over 500 airstrikes, destroyed about 100 car bombs, 100 tunnels, 300 bunkers -- this is ongoing every single day.\nWe're often asked how long this is going to take, and the answer is, in Mosul, it will take as long as it takes. I think it's useful to remember other campaigns against ISIL. Kobani, Raqqa, Baiji oil refinery are very significant campaigns; each of them took about six months. Some have gone faster -- Fallujah went a little faster than anticipated. And the key thing is that, what ISIL does in these cities is they set up concentric rings of defenses, and once you break through the crust of that defense, you don't know what's going to come next. Eventually they reach a culmination point; they simply cannot resupply, they run out of suicide bombers, and they culminate. And in Mosul, we don't when that will come. It could come very soon; it could come a couple months from now. But our momentum will be sustained and we'll provide relentless pressure on the enemy throughout Mosul.\nEvery single operation in Iraq that we have supported has succeeded, and all the ground that has been retaken from ISIL in Iraq has been held, and Mosul will be no different.\nLet me very briefly, in about five minutes, just go through some of the indicators that I discussed last time when I was here in June -- there's about eight of them, but I'll go them fairly quickly -- of how we track this overall campaign and how we measure how we're doing.\nThe first is territory. And we actually have a new map here which just came out this morning from our intelligence community, and the map demonstrates that ISIL continues to lose significant ground. And why is this important? Because what has made ISIL this global phenomenon, with all of these recruits from all around the world -- although that's rapidly diminishing -- is this notion of this homeland and caliphate. And all of their propaganda used to talk about this expanding homeland, this expanding movement, and they can no longer say that because their territory is now rapidly shrinking.\nSo in Iraq now, about 61 percent of territory that had been controlled by ISIL has now been reclaimed, and in Syria, about 28 percent. But what is most significant -- I think the last time I was here there was still a 98-kilometer strip of border with Turkey in which ISIL terrorists were still able to come in and out, and that is where the Paris attackers, the Brussels attackers transited through this route. So since then, over the last six months, we've worked very closely with the Syrian Democratic Forces, and also with Turkey and the moderate opposition to close off that route. It's at the number one in the map.\nSo ISIL now has no access to an international border, and this is significantly impacted the overall campaign because they are now a very isolated entity within Syria and Iraq, and, most importantly, it is much harder for them to come in and out, which is critical for them to project their terrorist acts outside of Iraq and Syria. So territory we're continuing to shrink as we speak, and that will continue.\nLeadership. ISIL's leadership ranks are dwindling. I already mentioned some of the recent strikes against their leaders in Raqqa. But since the start of the campaign we've eliminated nearly all of Abu Bakr Baghdadi deputies and his trusted advisors. That includes his likely successor, Haji Imam; his ministers for war, finance, oil and gas, security, and external operations. And as these leaders are replaced, we target and kill their replacements. And we've seen a significant degradation in their overall capabilities and ranks.\nBaghdadi himself -- he claims to be the caliph -- we have not seen his face in well over a year. He issued an audiotape about a month ago, but issuing audiotapes deep in hiding is not really a sign of a confident leader, particularly in today's media age. So eventually, we will find and eliminate him as well, but the leadership ranks continue to diminish.\nThird indicator, their overall fighting capacity, their overall strength, overall fighters. The number of battle-ready fighters inside Iraq and Syria is now at its lowest point that it's ever been. We estimate about 12,000 to 15,000. And ISIL is unable to replenish its ranks.\nWhereas we used to see about a thousand foreign fighters in the 2014 time frame flowing into Syria, coming from all around the world -- I've mentioned this before -- an unprecedented number of these foreign fighters, these jihadi fighters coming from all around the world, almost 40,000 -- it's now down to really what is quite a negligible amount, in our estimation.\nAnd that's really thanks, again, to our efforts on the ground and our Special Operators that have done an incredible job to clear out that area of the border just south of Turkey, and now the intervention from Turkey to protect its border, make sure that these terrorists cannot get in and out.\nWe are also making sure that foreign fighters cannot transit across borders. So about 60 countries within the coalition have really strengthened their laws against the transit of foreign fighters. Plots have been disrupted in about 15 countries, and this continues. One of the unsung efforts of our coalition which has really strengthened is the information-sharing among different capitals. This is something that has now really accelerated, and it's increased our ability to stay well ahead of this enemy.\nFourth indicator, briefly, is revenue. We're destroying ISIL's economic base. Just last week -- it's only one example, but last week, our air coalition destroyed about 168 ISIL oil tankers, the largest strike of its kind. And we've continued to target their oil and gas infrastructure, their bulk cash storage sites and their financial facilitators. They cannot pay their fighters. The fighters come thinking they're going to have this lavish lifestyle -- that is not happening. Their fighters are not getting paid, and we have multiple indications of that. And we will continue to maintain this relentless pressure.\nThe fifth indicator is one I mentioned -- this was really critical when we started this -- was their access to borders. Again, they were flowing in and out by almost over 1,000 a month. That is no longer happening. So quite significant development to close off their entire access to international borders.\nSixth indicator, media propaganda. ISIL used to have this very slick, sophisticated media information apparatus, and it was led by two people. One was Muhammad Adnani, their chief spokesman and also their head of external operations; and, two, a very sophisticated media expert named Dr. Waeli. He was kind of the head of all those slick videos they used to produce. Both of them are no longer around.\nWe also have been working very closely with the private sector and within the coalition to get their content off the Internet, to make it far harder to access. Their overall output is down by about 75 percent. If you just measure -- we measure these things in 12-month increments -- from August of 2015 to August this year, decrease of 75 percent. Twitter -- just one example -- have taken down 400,000 pro-ISIL Twitter handles. And the ratio of anti-ISIL information to pro-ISIL information has totally flipped from where it was two years ago. And we'll keep this going.\nThis is also a global effort. So ISIL tries to recruit with different messages around the world. So in the UK, we have the UK leading an effort to really target those who might be recruited in Europe. In the Gulf region, we're working very closely with the UAE. I met them -- really incredible young people who are working 24/7 to counter the toxic ideology and poisonous messages of ISIL. Saudi Arabia is helping quite a bit with that. And even in Southeast Asia, Malaysians and other critical partners within our coalition are helping to counter the message in that part of the world. Very different messages in different parts of the world, and we work to adapt to that.\nSeventh indicator, briefly, is what we call global cohesion. ISIL had sought to be a global organization with direct links, financial fighters, leaders, between its core in Iraq and Syria to these so-called affiliates. So in response, we've strengthened a global coalition to find and sever all of those links. The result has been a weakening of their so-called affiliates across the board. I mentioned Libya, but also Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, and Afghanistan -- all of these entities are being significantly degraded.\nImportantly, our coalition also includes multinational organizations, such as INTERPOL and Europol, to help develop a global database of ISIL-affiliated fighters to stop, again, their transit across borders. My deputy, Lieutenant General Wolfe, was at the INTERPOL annual meeting last month to try to strengthen these relationships and make sure that we are sharing the information we need to stay ahead of this threat.\nSo as ISIL's global cohesion weakens, ours is strengthening with cooperation across the globe.\nI would just say in conclusion -- and I mentioned this last time -- we are having tremendous success against this enemy. It is accelerating. We are now putting pressure on its two so-called capitals of Mosul and Raqqa -- simultaneous, relentless pressure. That will continue. We are killing their leaders. We're taking off their ability to finance and resource themselves. But this remains an unprecedented threat. The fight is not over. This will remain a multiyear effort. But we have developed a campaign that is global, and I hope I've demonstrated the overall breadth of the campaign.\nI also just want to say, since we've been doing this for a couple of years, and I visit our guys in the field all the time, we've lost five Americans in this campaign. Five of our military personnel have been killed in this campaign. And it's important to keep in mind, because I saw with my own eyes the casualty collection points just outside Mosul of the Iraqis who are fighting. We are advising them to fight and retake their territory, similar to our Syrian partners. And their casualties are very high. An operation in Manbij, Syria, for example, which was really important to protect us -- Manbij is where the foreign fighters were flowing through. It's where they were planning external operations. And the Syrian Democratic Forces in that operation had over a thousand casualties.\nSimilar in Mosul, the Iraqi security forces that we are training, advising and enabling are fighting heroically. They are taking casualties and continuing to advance. And I think we're all very proud to work with them and grateful. And it's also just a reminder of the different mode of operation we have here -- enabling, advising local partners to take back the ground that they have lost. And I think it is significant that all the ground we have taken as a coalition, working with locals, everything we've taken back from ISIL -- that's over 60 percent in Iraq, 28 percent in Syria -- none of it ISIL has been able to retake. And that is because before we do any of this we have a tremendous effort -- sometimes months long, sometimes shorter -- to prepare the ground politically, economically, to get the stabilization resources in place to help make sure people can return to their homes, and make sure that the defeat of ISIL is a lasting one.\nSo it is significant that to date ISIL has not retaken any of the ground it has lost in operations we have enabled. And we're going to make sure it continues that way.\nThat's quite a different approach, I will just say in closing, than the Russians. The Russians have really had one counter-ISIL mission -- they claim to be fighting ISIL -- they've had one counter-ISIL mission and that was Palmyra. And they made a big deal about that. They had a big concert and they invited members of the media to come see it. And ISIL has now retaken Palmyra. In our operations, ISIL has not retaken a speck of ground that we have taken from them. And I think it is fairly significant that the one operation the Russians touted as a counter-ISIL operation ISIL has now retaken.\nWe're not pleased about that. We want to wipe ISIL entirely off this map. The point of the map -- as I have explained before, everything that's in color on this map used to be controlled by ISIL. So the summer of 2014, everything there was part of the caliphate. Everything in green has been retaken, and everything in dark green is just what has been retaken in the last month. The dark red splotches in the southwest are areas that actually ISIL has gained over the last two years -- very small areas and areas that we primarily do not operate.\nAnd I'll just say finally on the situation, of course, in Aleppo -- this was discussed briefly in the meeting this morning, and there is a very active effort going on to try to resolve this. The Security Council, of course, will be convening later today. But of course, we've said a lot what we think about the tactics the Russians, the regime are using -- tactics that are totally different than anything we do against ISIL in Mosul. We are cognizant of every single innocent life in Mosul. We're fighting an enemy that is using human shields, and we're acting with tremendous precision. And if you see what the Russians are doing with the regime in Aleppo, it could not be any different.\nSo the contrasts I think are quite stark.\nWith that, I will leave it there. And I think overall, the campaign here against ISIL has momentum. We're always looking for ways to accelerate it and we're always talking about that, and we will not stop until we destroy this enemy.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, Brett.\nMark, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Can you say how you hand over an operation as complex as this to a new administration? And have you yet briefed any Trump transition personnel?\nMR. MCGURK: It's a great question. We were just talking about this. So just in my own experience, I was here in -- I was senior director for Iraq and Afghanistan in the Bush administration. It was the first transition in wartime in 40 years. And we worked very hard with President Bush and the incoming President-elect, President Obama, to have a very seamless transition, given the importance of a transition in wartime.\nSo this is similar -- a transition in wartime. It's complex. And the direction very clearly from President Obama is to make sure were doing all we can to ensure it can be a seamless transition. There, of course, will be a lot of continuity on the military side, and so we're doing all we possibly can to support that effort. I'll leave it there.\nQ: Have you conferred with Trump officials?\nMR. MCGURK: I think there's constant transition meetings going on, particularly in the State Department. I think those meetings are ongoing now.\nQ: Have you yet?\nMR. MCGURK: I won't talk about the individual meetings were having. Those meetings are ongoing constantly.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin.\nQ: On a few things. First was Libya, and I know you outlined a lot of progress. The estimates have been that there were between 5,000 and 8,000 ISIL fighters there. Obviously they weren't all killed, and so there's I think a kind of outstanding question about if those estimates were high, or if not, if they've escaped in a way that they could regroup and pose a problem later. And the other question was about oil revenues. You talked about that a lot the last time we saw you. And I'm wondering if the rise in oil prices globally could help ISIL in a way that sort of counteract some of the gains that you outlined here, or if you feel like they're cut off at this point from the global oil.\nMR. MCGURK: Thanks. Two very good questions. So in Libya, it's hard to get a precise estimate of how many. We think most of them were probably killed in Libya -- or in Sirte in that campaign. But they really holed up -- I mentioned this is what they do -- this is their defense strategy. They have these kind of rings of defense and then they have a little citadel in the middle where they try to hole up. And in Sirte, they did that for some months in a little final area of the city.\nOur Ambassador, Peter Bodde, our Ambassador to Libya, is in discussions with Prime Minister Sarraj about the next steps in this campaign and what support the Libyans might want. And of course, we'll be discussing that with him. We want to make sure, in our view, that ISIL and extremist groups cannot have safe haven and sanctuary anywhere in Libya.\nOn the oil trade, we have significantly reduced their ability to generate any serious revenue from oil. Of course, though, it does continue, but it's all self-generated. I mean, they cannot get any oil out of their little self-contained entity. There is definitely trade going on between different groups -- this is a very chaotic situation, particularly in Syria -- but their ability to replenish their resources is just significantly degraded. And whenever we find where they are extracting oil we make sure that we eliminate that.\nQ: The concern seems to be, though, that fighters were able to escape. And you're discounting that? You think sort of the -- our allies were able to sort of fully encapsulate the city?\nMR. MCGURK: We don't get into numbers. We think we eliminated quite -- the vast majority there in Sirte. But if they try to regroup, I'm certain we'll find a way to deal with that.\nMR. EARNEST: Mark.\nQ: The information-sharing with the Turks, it's been really strained on the diplomatic level -- obviously the whole question of cooperation with the coup and the allegations and the request for the return of the fellow that they think was involved in the coup. Has that been reflected at all in the cooperation you've seen in the counter-ISIL campaign?\nMR. MCGURK: Obviously it's a complex relationship. I was in Ankara about four or five days ago, had very good, very detailed meetings in Ankara about the overall situation. And the Turks have done an awful lot here over the last year, very close cooperation with us in the counter-ISIL fight, and I felt very good coming out of those meetings about the way forward.\nGeneral Dunford is in regular contact. The day before I was in Ankara he was in Incirlik meeting his counterpart, General Akar. So our communications with Turkey is extremely close. They are doing an operation now -- just south of that green splotch here, near Al-Bab -- and obviously we're looking for ways to try to help them defeat ISIL in that particularly sensitive area.\nIt's also a sensitive area of the country because you have a number of different forces converging. So a lot of what we do every single day is try to make sure that we deescalate any tension between non-ISIL affiliated forces that we have relationships with so everybody is focused on the same enemy. This is extremely hard.\nAnd that's why I mentioned there's another model for doing this -- we can send in the 82nd Airborne to go in and do all this kind of stuff. We do not think that that would be a lasting, sustainable way to do it. We think what is sustainable, particularly in something as complex as Syria, is advising, assisting, enabling. And I think the record of what we've been able to clear out proves that. But it makes it complex, because we're trying to encourage our partners that were working with on the ground, you guys need to go that way, when sometimes they want to go a different way. So this is what the daily communication and constant discussions are with the Turks and different actors on the ground.\nBut I was very encouraged by my meetings in Ankara last week that we have a shared way forward, and it's going to continue.\nQ: They're fighting the ISIL forces as much as they want to fight the Kurds?\nMR. MCGURK: Well, right now they are engaged in a hostile fight against ISIL, and Turkey soldiers have taken casualties. And I think we have to extend our condolences to them. I did that when I was there. They are engaged in a fight against ISIL on the ground, definitely.\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle.\nQ: About a week ago, there were reports in Syria the ISIS leadership or what's left of it was meeting to try to pick a al-Baghdadi successor. What do you know about that? Do you think al-Baghdadi is wounded or incapacitated in some way? And even if he were taken out of the picture, how much of an effect would that have on their strength?\nMR. MCGURK: So it's a great question. I saw those reports, which we can't confirm. I would say any ISIL leaders have a pretty good succession plan because we're removing them at a pretty fast clip. Baghdadi is unique because he's the guy that rose in the Grand Mosque in Mosul and declared a caliphate, which I think I mentioned this the last time I was here -- but I travel now all around the world to countries in which their young men, and in many cases, young women, have been attracted to this movement. And when you say what is it that has attracted your young people to this movement, there's a number of different answers, but there's a common denominator -- this notion of a homeland and a caliphate.\nAnd Baghdadi claims to have a unique -- this phony unique claim to being a caliph. This is all a total fraud, but he claims to have this unique lineage that makes him a caliph. So I definitely think that when we do eliminate Baghdadi it will make a significant difference.\nI also think it is significant that he tried to be a kind of new type of terrorist leader -- giving public speeches, going to the Grand Mosque and giving this sermon in the summer of 2014 -- and he is now in deep, deep hiding. And we have not heard from him until he issued this audiotape a couple months ago, and it was a very defensive message. It basically said, for all of the fighters in Mosul, stay and fight to the death. But all the indications we're getting is that many did not take that message well because where is Baghdadi? He is somewhere in hiding. And we also know he hides with slaves and all sorts of terrible things. This guy is one of the most despicable we've ever seen.\nSo we're doing all we can to find and eliminate him. As I mentioned, all of his deputies -- nearly all of his deputies have been eliminated. And it's a matter of time before we find him. I do think it will make a significant difference on ISIL as an organization, as a movement, once he's eliminated, but it will not eliminate this kind of global jihadi terrorist threat, obviously.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Given all the progress, does ISIS still have the ability to plot and orchestrate attacks against the United States and our allies from the territory that they have remaining? And will President Obama leave office with that ability apparently still intact?\nAnd on Aleppo, you said it was discussed briefly. There are reports that there are scores of civilians being massacred by the advancing Syrian army. There are also reports of a ceasefire. Did those issues come up, and was there any response to that from the President?\nMR. MCGURK: So in terms of plotting, this is what they want to do. ISIL wants to attack us, and they want to attack our partners. And they're very sophisticated -- the Paris attacks, the Brussels attacks, those were planned in Raqqa. They ran through some of these other towns I mentioned and they would deploy their operatives to carry out attacks. We think we significantly degraded their ability to do that. But they do have operatives in a number of places in which they are planning external attacks. This is something that is the primary focus of ours, to eliminate what I call that external operations network.\nSo the head of it was Mohammad Adnani. That's why targeting him was so significant. Most of this is also being done in Raqqa, but I think we have demonstrated these three I mentioned today that were eliminated just a few days ago were part of this very sophisticated terrorist plotting network.\nSo every single opportunity we get we are degrading this network, but it still exists. This is still a threat. They are trying to recruit -- not planned, sophisticated attacks -- they're trying to do that, but they're also trying to recruit deranged individuals from all over the world to act in their name. And that is something that is very hard to stop, which is why the information-sharing and everything we're doing kind of behind the scenes as a coalition is so critical.\nI can't speak to what's happening in Aleppo right now. I will just say, as I think I mentioned at the outset, this is a horrific situation. I think it demonstrates once again the tactics that the Russians are using in support of the regime are something that is truly beyond the pale, could not be any different than the types of tactics that we utilize. And I've also seen these reports of the ceasefire and a potential agreement, but I can't confirm any of that because this is all fairly late-breaking. But I understand the Security Council will be convening later today to discuss it.\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on your trip to Ankar. What did you hear from the Turks that made you so confidant, vis-а-vis what they planned in Al-Bab and with regards to what you just said?\nMR. MCGURK: Well, I'd just say this. Turkey is at war against ISIL. There's no question about that. They are fighting on the ground, they are taking casualties. And ISIL is a significant threat to Turkey, and that is something that they see very clearly, and so we're working through various ways in which we can help them.\nWe do have disagreements, of course, in terms of some things going on in Syria, which we also have very candid discussions about. When it comes to Raqqa, we want to get ISIL out of Raqqa as soon as possible, but this will be a sequence campaign. That's the only way to do it. So we're in the isolation, kind of the strangulation phase now. And then we have to identify the force to actually move in and seize and hold the city. There are a few options for that. One of the options, of course, is working very closely with Turkey, and we are having a detailed discussion with them about this.\nBut the most significant thing when I was in Turkey was just their threat perception of ISIL as a significant threat to Turkey, which it is. Turkey has suffered more casualties in ISIL attacks than almost any of our other coalition partners. And so while we've had some disagreements over the years, I thought we had a pretty good shared way forward. Not to say there isn't some tension, obviously.\nQ: I also wanted to ask, are U.S. forces embedding with the Popular Mobilization Forces?\nMR. MCGURK: Embedding with popular -- I think you're talking about a report in which there was a photograph of some training of -- so Popular Mobilization Forces are known as being primarily Shia militia forces, many of which operate outside the command and control of the Iraqi government, which is a significant problem, not only to us but also to the Iraqi government.\nBut under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces, there are local forces from these areas to hold the ground after operations conclude. Many of these are locals from Nineveh Province -- so Sunnis, Christians, all sorts of -- it's a very diverse province. I'll give you an example. In Anbar Province, under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces, about 15,000 local Anbari tribal fighters mobilized to fight Daesh. That is one reason why, from the four to the five, all of that is green. We cannot do that only with the Iraqi security forces. We needed the tribes to be mobilized. So those are all Sunnis from Anbar. They're being paid by the government to fight ISIL, and we're, of course, supporting them.\nMR. EARNEST: Richard.\nQ: Could you tell us a little more about the coalition partners? Are they just as resolute as the U.S. in continuing further? And can you tell us -- the operation themselves, how -- what's the percentage of the operation being done by the U.S., and the coalition -- the percentage by the coalition partners? Besides Turkey?\nMR. MCGURK: So a very good question. I've been at this from the beginning, the inception of the coalition, when we had about 15 countries, and there was always a question of what will this grow into.\nIn the last three weeks, we had all 68 -- ambassadors from all 68 members at the State Department, and we also held what's called kind of the small group of coalition countries, over 20 countries, in Berlin, just a couple weeks ago. And what is fairly extraordinary about this is the sense of international consensus about the need to basically destroy this enemy, and the sense of burden-sharing.\nAs I mentioned, the United States will not do this -- we cannot succeed in this alone. And the coalition remains extremely strong. So Secretary Carter will be seeing his counterparts in London here in a few days. And the overall cohesion of the coalition across all these multiple lines of effort -- the military gets a lot of the focus, but it is counter-finance, counter-propaganda, counter-foreign fighters, and everything kind of working together -- that we have coordinating mechanisms throughout the coalition. It is working extraordinarily well. And the international consensus behind this effort is something I think we have to continue to build upon, because it is something that's quite extraordinary.\nIn terms of overall effort, I mentioned there's been about\n-- over 17,000 airstrikes now. I think if you add them up, about 4,500 or so have been coalition airstrikes. So, definitely U.S. military forces are doing the bulk of the airstrikes. There's a reason for that -- we have the best military in the world. But the number of coalition partners operating to support that effort is quite significant.\nAnd, of course, we couldn't do this without flying out of Incirlik Airbase, flying out of some other areas within the region. And we're obviously very grateful for that. Without the coalition, we would not be able to defeat this enemy.\nMR. EARNEST: We probably have time for two more and then we're going to let Brett go.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just want to sort of follow up, especially as it relates to the coalition and strikes. There's been some reporting, Brett, that the U.S. needed to use the Australians to conduct strikes against some of the Paris attackers, and I wonder if you can sort of help me unpack the complications as it relates to the chain of command that the United States might have in conducting airstrikes and having to utilize coalition partners like Australia and others?\nAnd second, I wanted to ask you about Saudi Arabia. That story has come out today and I wondered if you could sort of help unpack this idea that the U.S. is limiting military support for the Saudis because of what's been happening vis-а-vis civilian casualties in Yemen.\nMR. EARNEST: I can take the Yemen one, Brett.\nMR. MCGURK: So let me -- I'll just say about the -- and I defer to my DOD colleagues who work this every single day -- this has been the most precise air campaign in history. I mean, I think it will be studied in the future and people will -- the most precise air campaign in history. And all of our airstrikes go through a common structure in terms of validating the targets. And it is really moving at an incredible clip.\nI can't get into the details of sometimes who does a strike and everything. What I will say is, when I mentioned today -- and this was mentioned also by Secretary Carter earlier today -- eliminating these external plotters in the streets of Raqqa, painstaking, tireless work by coalition actors, our military forces, our folks on the ground, our intelligence apparatus -- all working as one team. And it doesn't always work that well, but it is working quite, quite well.\nBut I just can't get into in terms of who does what. But it is the most precise air campaign in history. We're very proud of it, and that will continue.\nI'll just say about Saudi Arabia -- I was in Saudi Arabia a couple weeks ago to meet with Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. I've seen him a number of times, including also with Muhammad bin Nayef. And Saudi Arabia also is in this fight. I mean, ISIL is a fundamental threat to Saudi Arabia. If you read ISIL's propaganda, if you read what Baghdadi writes, he's obsessed with Saudi Arabia and striking in Saudi Arabia. So we are working very closely with the Saudis in a whole range of areas in order to help degrade ISIL, particularly on a lot of the counter-ideological fights. So they're very much in this as well.\nAnd I'll let Josh address the Yemen question.\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: John Brennan has suggested that the campaign on the ground and the campaign against ISIL globally are going in two opposite directions. He said this summer, we still have a ways to go before we're able to say that we've made some significant progress. And he warned that the trajectories for this ISIS religious state or caliphate and global violence point in opposite directions. \"As the pressure mounts on ISIL,\" he said, \"we judge that it will intensify its global terror campaign to maintain its domination of the global terrorism agenda.\"\nYou're sort of saying the opposite thing. You're saying that these two campaigns are going in exactly the same directions instead of opposite directions, and you're pointing to the three deaths recently of these external plotters as evidence of that.\nTell me why there's such a difference between what you're saying and what some other intelligence people in the administration are saying. Why are you so convinced these two things are going together while other say it's sort of like squeezing a balloon -- if you squeeze it here, they're going to show up someplace else?\nMR. MCGURK: I don't think it's so much of a disagreement. In fact, all of our intelligence assessments inform the way we obviously discuss this and prosecute the campaign. I said this will be a multiyear effort. Be very clear about that. The number of foreign fighters, the number of people indoctrinated into this ideology is something that will not be overcome for a number of years. And while the notion of the caliphate is what kind of led to this explosive growth of ISIL -- that is why shrinking the caliphate is so important -- but their desire to inspire attacks around the world as they lose their territory is something that we expect will probably increase.\nHow do they want to stay relevant? They're trying to spark and inspire attacks around the world. That's why they used to say -- Muhammad Adnani's last statement was very interesting. If you read of Muhammad Adnani, the spokesman, all of his propaganda, again, it used to be about, come to the homeland, or retain and expand the caliphate. Most of their propaganda were these sundrenched scenes of children and families and a very optimistic message, actually.\nHis last message before his death was very different. It actually said, we might lose all of our territory, but we'll still be around, and, in fact, if you can't come -- because you can't because it's hard to get in here now -- stay home, pick up a knife, and attack someone down the street. It was a very different message. It's a message that does not appeal to a broad segment of the population. It's a message that appeals to really deranged individuals. But they are trying to remain relevant as they lose their homeland -- what they call their homeland -- by trying to inspire these attacks.\nAnd that is something that will continue. And that is why one thing we've done in the coalition, we talk about even as we degrade their ability to have territory in Iraq and Syria, we need to adapt as a coalition to increase our ability to share information, our hubs of sharing information, to be able to stay ahead of the threat. So that's something as a coalition I think will continue for some time.\nSo the military-focused coalition of taking back these cities, which we will do, will evolve into a coalition focused on the information-sharing, the patterns of interaction among capitals, among intelligence communities, among law enforcement communities. It's something we have to continue to expand upon and grow.\nQ: But, Brett, that's a much less optimistic, even frightening message for those of us in this part of the world, because it's suggesting that your success there only increases the dangers here, no?\nMR. MCGURK: No, because what they can do inside of Iraq and Syria are these big spectacular attacks. Make no mistake, these are terrorists. It's an international terrorist organization that has the same ideology as Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. The only difference between ISIL and al Qaeda is that ISIL said, let's do a caliphate now, whereas al Qaeda said, well, we'll do a caliphate down the road.\nThat's the key difference. But they aspire to do massive spectacular attacks around the world, and in order to do that, they need territory to plan and plot and resource. And so we're making sure that they are on their heels every single day, but I would never get up here and say this threat is something that is going to go away or something that we cannot remain absolutely vigilant on.\nAnd which is why, as I mentioned, it's not just DOD and State; it's our entire government working as part of this integrated campaign plan to stay ahead of it because it's different tools. It's military, law enforcement, intel, and counter messaging. So we need to stay at it every single day and remain vigilant for a long time to come.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Brett. I appreciate it.\nMR. MCGURK: Okay, thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, we can go back to our regularly scheduled programming now. (Laughter.)\nKevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Josh, I did want to ask about laying the blame for Palmyra to Russia, but now that it has been retaken, or partially been retaken, what is the strategy going forward? Is the U.S. going to be involved in that operation? It would seem to be a ripe target now that you have these forces there that we know about. Or are we going to leave that to the Russians to deal with?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as Brett mentioned, this obviously is something that we're concerned about. I do think that it exposes the failed strategy, or at least calls into question the integrity of those who are describing their strategy.\nTheir strategy, as they stated, is to be focused on ISIL and to be focused on extremists and terrorists. But the truth is the real consequence of their strategy, which appears to be an intense focus on bombing innocent civilians into submission so that the Assad regime can enjoy some tactical gains, actually results in fueling the kind of extremism that we know extremists rely on to thrive.\nIt also is exhibit A when you consider this is an example of Russia taking their eye off the ball when it comes to terrorists. That they did have this one limited successful operation against Palmyra -- one that the United States was not involved in but one that we were obviously pleased, and we said so at the time, that this was territory that had been taken away from ISIL -- but the strategy that Russia has employed has caused them to take their eye off the ball, allow ISIL to make some gains, but it also continues to fuel the kind of extremism that only makes Syria a haven for terrorist organizations that plot violence not just in the region but around the world.\nQ: You've left that particular battle to Russia, and I guess the question now going forward, is that strategy going to change? Will the U.S. get involved in the fight for this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any operational updates at this point, so I can't tell you sort of where this will fall in terms of any planned military operations on the part of our coalition. But it's obviously a situation that we're watching closely.\nAyesha.\nQ: Iran today ordered its scientists to start developing nuclear-powered marine vessels for what it said as a response to a U.S. violation of the atomic deal. So I was wondering, how much of a concern is this, this kind of maybe tit for tat, the idea that Iran is now saying that it's responding to actions taken by Congress by building these nuclear-powered vessels? Is there a concern that this is going to be an ongoing thing and that there's going to be kind of back and forth now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would agree with your assessment that the timing of this announcement to coincide with the President's signing of the Iran Sanctions Act is not likely a coincidence, but we've been clear even through much of the congressional debate in Congress about the Iran Sanctions Act that the President would not sign into law a piece of legislation that undermined the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nThe extension of the Iran Sanctions Act does not undermine the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And we've -- that's been our position from the beginning. We've explained that quite clearly in public and we've explained that in private to the Iranians.\nAt the same time, the announcement from the Iranians today does not run counter to the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We continue to be able to watch closely Iran's nuclear program, starting in the uranium mills and throughout the nuclear supply chain. That is an unprecedented insight into any country's nuclear program, and allows us to verify their ongoing compliance with that program. And our expectation is that as they undertake these kinds of research-and-development efforts, that they will do so consistent with their international obligations.\nAnd we have the ability, because of the cooperation with the Iranians under the agreement, to verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement.\nQ: But does this kind of -- going forward, should this be something of a warning to Congress or to the next administration that there could be repercussions for pursuing more sanctions, or anything like that?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I wouldn't be particularly concerned about that. There are a range of Iranian activities that are a source of concern to the international community and to President Obama outside the scope of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The reason that we pursued that international agreement is because Iran's ability to get access to and potentially use a nuclear weapon was the number-one concern of the United States and the international community with regard to Iran.\nSo we've taken that top concern off the table without firing a single shot. And this is something that even the harshest critics of the deal acknowledge has been accomplished. It didn't eliminate all of our concerns with Iran, but it did eliminate our number-one concern about Iran, and that's ultimately the point.\nThere are other concerns that we have about Iran's behavior that include their support for terrorist organizations and other destabilizing elements in the Middle East, like Hezbollah. We are concerned about the way that Iran continues to menace Israel, and we continue to be concerned about the Iranian regime's lack of respect for basic universal human rights. And we have a variety of ways of countering all of that activity -- some of that involves additional financial sanctions. Some of that involves close cooperation with our partners in the region.\nBut the number-one objective of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons was to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And that objective has been achieved. And because of our ability to monitor Iran's nuclear program, we can verify the ongoing success of that effort. And it certainly is something that makes the world a safer place. It enhances the national security of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. It enhances the national security of our NATO partners in -- NATO allies in Europe. And it enhances the national security of the American people, and it will be an important part of President Obama's foreign policy legacy.\nJustin.\nQ: The Energy Department said today that it wasn't going to be turning over names of individual employees involved in the President's climate change efforts to the transition team, the Trump transition team, and said that the request left employees unsettled. I'm wondering if you can explain if that was the only reason that that was made, and why this doesn't sort of -- if it was information that the Trump transition team wanted -- violate the President's sort of edict for helping them as much as they can to smooth over the transition.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we do continue to work closely with the transition team to ensure a smooth and effective transition. And that is work that is going on across a variety of federal agencies, including at the Department of Energy. But there were reports about what certainly could have been an attempt to target civil servants, career, federal government employees.\nThe kinds of people that we're talking about at the Department of Energy are scientists and lawyers and other experts who are critical to the success of the federal government's ability to make policy. And their work transcends the term of any one President. That's by design. That's to ensure the continuity of the federal government and to ensure that effective decision-making and policy planning is undertaken regardless of which political party is in charge of the Oval Office. If we had to replace the entire Department of Energy every time a new President was elected, that is certainly going to undermine the ability of those at the most senior levels to implement a coherent and effective energy policy.\nOur principle -- and this is a principle that Presidents in both parties have long abided by -- is that we should observe the protections that are in place that ensure that career civil servants are evaluated based on merit and not on politics. And I'm sure that the President-elect used the same kind of criteria when choosing his new Department of Energy Secretary as well. Don't you think? (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, I'll let you interpret that one.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: But the President mentioned in his \"Daily Show\" interview last night that he planned to do some speeches after leaving office, and seemed to purposefully delineate those from political speeches that he might give if Donald Trump and his administration did something politically that he disagreed with. So assuming that these are paid speeches -- I mean, this is something that maybe is on your mind, as well -- I'm wondering if the President is going to be putting any sort of self-imposed restrictions on who -- you know, this was a big campaign issue in Wall Street. Education, foreign governments, that sort of thing -- if those sort of things are being set out already.\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that there will be significant interest in hearing from former President Obama once he's left office. So he'll have an opportunity to be choosy about which invitations he accepts. And I don't have any criteria to lay out for you at this point about how he will choose which invitations to accept, but I'm confident that there will be a high standard that he'll observe.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks. Can I circle back on Yemen?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: The United States' support for the Saudis, at least bringing it back, I'm understanding, because in part of the civilian casualties in Yemen. Can you give me sort of an update on why that decision was made and what that means moving forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, we have long expressed some pretty significant concerns about the high rate of civilian casualties in Yemen. And many of those casualties have been as a result of operations carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in the region. Not all of them -- there have also been civilian casualties as a result of operations carried out by their adversaries, as well.\nBut of course, the United States is playing a role in supporting the Saudi-led coalition. And in light of the high rate of civilian casualties, there was -- the President ordered a review of the kind of assistance that the United States provides to the Saudis as they undertake this effort. That review is ongoing, but there are a couple of steps that the United States is prepared to take to change some of the assistance that we provide.\nThat includes refocusing our efforts to support the Saudis when it comes to enhancing their border security and their territorial integrity. The concerns that the Saudis have expressed, which is entirely legitimate, is that you have an organization that has overthrown the government of Yemen and has menaced Saudi Arabia, on a number of occasions even breaching their borders.\nSo Saudi Arabia's concerns about this I think are entirely legitimate. And so we are going to focus our efforts on helping the Saudis protect their border. We also are going to undertake steps to refocus our information-sharing and the responsibilities of our personnel in Saudi Arabia to be focused on this effort.\nIn addition, we've also decided to -- well, I think that covers it. And I think this is reflective of the fact that we have these longstanding concerns. This review has been ordered. And these are some changes that we've made, but this review is ongoing. And as this process moves forward, I wouldn't rule out additional steps that we may take to address the concerns that have been raised.\nQ: Just a couple more, really quickly. A number of electors, you were told yesterday, were requesting an intelligence briefing, and you said you hadn't had a chance to sort of look over that letter. Have you had a chance to look that over? And what's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some more of the published reports. Look, when it comes to the Electoral College, we're talking about some of the more esoteric aspects of the functioning of our democracy.\nQ: Yeah, we are.\nMR. EARNEST: But it certainly is important that individuals who are entrusted with that responsibility do so with a seriousness of purpose. So at this point, I don't have a formal response to the letter to put forward.\nQ: But would you support that idea of having the report sent to electors prior to them casting their votes?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I know that some of the request was for classified information, and it's not clear that all of the electors -- and I'm sure most of them don't -- they don't have security clearances.\nSo this is an unusual request, maybe even unprecedented. I'm not a historian, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where a similar question arose. So we'll let you know if we have more of a response.\nQ: Last one. Is the White House aware of post-election intelligence that actually shows anything to do with the hackers' intent? We've talked a bit about that, because there have been widely differing assessments. I'm just wondering if the White House remains confident that the intelligence has not in fact been politicized.\nMR. EARNEST: The President is certainly confident. And he insists that the intelligence that he is provided as the Commander-in-Chief by our intelligence agencies is not clouded by political politics or partisan politics. He insists that that material, that that intelligence that he is provided is not clouded by the pursuit of an agenda, a political agenda or otherwise.\nThe President can only make good decisions -- the Commander-in-Chief, any Commander-in-Chief can only make good decisions when they have information that is accurate, that is timely, and that is reliable. And that's what the President insists on. And that also means that the President wants to hear the unvarnished truth. He doesn't want anything shaded. He doesn't want any intelligence professional to fear retribution for presenting bad news to the President of the United States. In some ways, that's actually the basic job description of an intelligence professional who's briefing a principal, and that is to be able to give an unvarnished assessment, even if it's bad news, without fear of any retribution.\nAnd the President has confidence that that's the kind of guidance and information that he's been provided by the intelligence community.\nQ: Any intelligence as to the intent of the hackers?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updated assessment to share at this point, but there certainly seem to be a not insignificant number of intelligence professionals who appear to be sharing their opinion with all of you on an anonymous basis. I obviously don't have the luxury of doing that, but when there is a formal assessment to share from the intelligence community, and if that's something that can be shared publicly, that's something that we'll try to do.\nThe President does believe that we should -- particularly when it relates to something as central to our democracy as the conduct of a national election, the President does believe that we should share as much information as possible with the public. And that is why the intelligence community, on October 7th -- more than a month before the election -- issued a statement that represented the unanimous assessment and conclusion of all 17 national security agencies that have an intelligence arm. And they concluded that Russia was engaged in malicious activity in cyberspace that was aimed at destabilizing our elections.\nAnd we made -- the President made clear, we made clear that a proportional response to that was appropriate. But the President's first concern and the first steps that were undertaken by the U.S. government were to ensure that the equipment and systems that were used to register voters, allow voters to cast ballots and to ensure that those ballots were counted were protected. And the intelligence community has assessed -- and this is something that they've also said publicly -- that they did not observe an increase in malicious cyber activity from the Russians on Election Day that could have disrupted the casting and accurate counting of ballots.\nBut for a more detailed assessment about what Russia's motives are, or what else Russia may have been engaged in in the context of the election, are a series of questions that will be considered in this review that President Obama has ordered. Our expectation is that this is a review from the intelligence community that will be completed in advance of January 20th. And we're going to make public as much of that review as possible.\nMichelle.\nQ: Will the President talk a little bit about the hacks, since he announced the review last night? And he said that it was nothing fancy; that we saw -- it's been happening, coming from Russia, seeming to put it into a bigger perspective. And he also talked about how he felt that the emails were the things that became the obsession, not the fact that this was coming from Russia, even though he just said that was really nothing new in the same breath.\nBut it seems like what we should be identifying there is the poor state of cybersecurity in this country. The fact that we're even sitting here talking about this being a possibility, and the strong possibility that the election could have been influenced by this, doesn't that really point to the fact that our defenses -- whether they're government systems or campaign systems -- the strength of them pales in comparison to the ability of a state actor like Russia to affect things here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by acknowledging at least one aspect of your premise that I think we can agree on, which is that cybersecurity should be, and is, a critical national security priority of the United States. And President Obama has spent a significant portion of his presidency trying to strengthen the defenses of the United States. And we've made important progress in doing so.\nSome of his proposals for doing so -- increasing our investments in cybersecurity -- have unfortunately fallen on deaf ears in Congress. And you'll recall that there was a substantial increase that was included in the President's budget for cybersecurity that Republicans in Congress refused to even consider. They wouldn't even hold a hearing. This was the first time in 40 years that Republicans in the Congress wouldn't even hold a hearing on the President's budget. And there wasn't the kind of robust consideration in Congress, let alone a vote, on the substantial increase in cybersecurity resources that President Obama had identified.\nSo when it comes to ensuring that the U.S. government is focused on cybersecurity, that is a message that apparently has not been received by Republicans in Congress, and, yes, that makes the United States of America more vulnerable to a wide range of threats. And that is something that the President continues to be deeply concerned about.\nThe other thing that the President has done is ordered this review by a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Panel to help the incoming administration formulate and take additional steps to implement an enhanced cybersecurity strategy. And that's a report that the President received just last week. And that's one that we'll be passing on to the next administration, and should position them for success.\nBut it's going to require the Republican White House being more persuasive with Republicans in Congress to actually pay attention to this issue. Because there's been a tendency on the part of Republicans in Congress to ignore or reject every proposal that we've put forward, even when it comes to something as apolitical and central to our national security as cybersecurity.\nSo that all being said, I don't think anybody envisions a scenario in which the federal government of the United States steps in to assume responsibility for the cybersecurity of a national political party or of an individual political operative. I don't think there's anybody that thinks that that would be appropriate or even effective.\nIs this a lesson for all of us to try to be more conscientious about our cyber hygiene? Yes. But state actors have substantial capabilities. Russia has substantial capabilities. They're not as significant as the capabilities that are wielded by the United States, but they are substantial. And establishing rules for the road -- rules of the road for effective and acceptable conduct in cyberspace is an important challenge, and one that we've made some progress on.\nFor example, the President last fall, a little over a year ago now, worked with the Chinese to reach an agreement about at least one norm that should be observed, which is that state actors should not be engaged in cyber-enabled theft for commercial purposes or for commercial benefit. That had been a previous activity on the part of the Chinese government that had attracted significant concerns, not just by the U.S. government but also by U.S. businesses, I think for obvious reasons. And that is one norm that we have made a lot of progress in establishing in cyberspace.\nBut we clearly have more work to do. But I don't think there's anybody who thinks that the answer to this situation is for the federal government of the United States to be responsible for the cybersecurity of the Democratic and Republican Parties.\nQ: But by the same token, it seems like we're seeing that the weakness of individuals' email systems collectively, in the sense that a foreign state could come in and try or succeed in affecting an election, is almost a threat to national security, or at least a threat to the functioning of democracy in this country. So has the weakest link kind of become an individual's email account?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think so, because I don't think that's what the President has identified.\nThis is going to be a challenge for our democracy as the American people consume information in the modern age. The fact that this information that was leaked from a variety of places, including John Podesta's Gmail account, that was the source of intense media interest, primarily because of the gossip that may or may not be contained in those emails -- not because of the fact that Russia was releasing that information as a transparent effort to, at a minimum, erode confidence in our democracy.\nAnd I think that there are obvious questions about cybersecurity that I covered in response to your first question. I think what the President is raising is the need for careful evaluation about our public debate, about the way that these views are communicated -- or the way this news is communicated and the way that it is consumed by people all across the country. And if we lose the ability as a democracy to acknowledge generally accepted facts, basic facts, or if we lose the ability -- or at least norms are eroded, such that you have Republicans cheering for Russians to hack their political opponents.\nAnd what's troubling about this situation is it wasn't just any old Republican who was doing that, it was the Republican nominee for President who was doing that. That's problematic. That doesn't have anything to do with cybersecurity. It has something to do very basically, though, with the kind of political debate and political discourse and democracy that we want to have.\nQ: And we're hearing some pushback, strong pushback today from some Democrats on the President-elect's picks for Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary of State -- ties to Russia, deals with Russia, views on sanctions, among other things. Do you have anything to add, even in a general sense, on those choices?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would say generally is that throughout his campaign, the President-elect indicated his intent, if elected President, to pursue warmer relations with Russia. So what better way to do that than to choose somebody who has been awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin to be your Secretary of State?\nSo this is not a particularly surprising or even unexpected development. I suspect that there will be many members of Congress in both parties that have some questions about that. I've previously stated the principle that President Obama believes that any President should have some latitude in assembling his team, but there is a process for members of the Senate to consider the nomination of people who will serve in the Cabinet.\nAnd, look, Mr. Tillerson is a seasoned business executive and he's got some skills in answering tough questions in public, and I suspect he'll have to put them to use in the spring.\nChris, go ahead.\nQ: Thanks. It was only until President Obama signed an executive order in 2014 barring federal contractors from discriminating against federal workers that ExxonMobil adopted a policy to prohibit discrimination against their employees who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. And the shareholders of that company, prior to that annual meetings had rejected such a policy 17 consecutive times.\nGiven the practices of that company, does that raise concerns about, first of all, whether the President's adaption of LGBT human rights as part of foreign policy will be in jeopardy in the next administration, as well as the non-discrimination policy that he's put in place for federal contractors?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by making an observation, Chris, which is that we have often talked about how disappointed we've been that at various stages Congress has not made progress on a range of issues that the President has prioritized, including ensuring that we treat LGBT Americans fairly and not discriminate against them. And we haven't seen as much legislation passed by Congress as we would like to see that would ensure that those protections are in place. So the President has turned to using the executive powers at his disposal to try to advance those policies.\nAnd we have acknowledged at every turn that those executive actions are not a substitute for legislative action. And there's been a skepticism expressed by some, most of them Democrats, who say that, well, an executive action isn't as forceful or as broad as legislation. They're right about that of course. But you have highlighted, actually, a good example where the President taking executive action hasn't just had an impact in the government, but it's also had an impact in the private sector as well.\nSo I think this is just one example of how the President's judicious use of executive authority has been effective in changing minds and practices not just inside the federal government, but in the private sector as well.\nMore broadly, I think it's hard to tell exactly what this particular personnel announcement says about the kinds of policies that President Trump will pursue once he is in office with regard to ensuring that Americans are not discriminated against because of their sexuality. And I think, to put it generously, we've gotten some mixed signals publicly about what the President-elect's intent is. So as with so many other issues that are important, we'll have to wait and see what policy he intends to pursue.\nEllen.\nQ: My question is, how is the President planning on integrating the fact that -- into this security report -- the fact that Julian Assange from WikiLeaks and the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan says it wasn't Russia at all, that they met with the person that leaked this, it was an inside job, et cetera?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have not seen reports citing the British ambassador to Uzbekistan, so I compliment you on the breadth of your reading. What I will just say is the view that Russia was actively involved in cyber activity that was aimed at eroding public confidence in our political system is the unanimous, high-confidence conclusion of all 17 intelligence agencies in the United States. That is not a recently known fact. That is not a recently disclosed conclusion. That is a conclusion and a finding and an assessment that was released a month before the election.\nSo I know that the President-elect himself has raised doubts about that assessment. Apparently, the British ambassador to Uzbekistan has made common cause with the President-elect to raise those doubts. But the American people will have to judge for themselves whether they have more confidence in the ability of the United States intelligence community to unanimously reach the same conclusion on this matter, or if they trust the conclusion of the British ambassador to Uzbekistan.\nMaggie.\nQ: Circling back, back to the Department of Energy, is this the first time that the administration has flat-out denied a request made by the Trump transition team?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think it's an entirely legitimate question. I don't think I can get into all of the conversations that are taking place at federal agencies all across this town and all across the country to ensure a smooth and effective transition.\nI can tell you that, in general, the administration has worked hard to diligently provide as much information as possible to the incoming team. And that is not the kind of work that you can do just at a moment's notice. This is a lot of work that requires months and months of planning, and this administration has planning since the beginning of the year to compile and prepare materials for the review of the incoming administration.\nAnd obviously we envisioned a different kind of process and a different kind of transition, but we remain no less committed to ensuring that the incoming administration can hit the ground running. And that means providing extensive information to the incoming administration, and that effort will continue through Inauguration Day.\nQ: Since you brought it up earlier, care to elaborate on your thoughts on President-elect's pick for Energy Secretary?\nMR. EARNEST: I think I've said enough about that. (Laughter.)\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask what the President's thoughts are today regarding Aleppo and what the fall of the city means for his legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, Andrew, as Brett alluded to, the situation in Aleppo remains deeply troubling, and the innocent loss of life there that has persisted for years at the hands of the Assad regime, enabled by the Russians and Iranians, is deplorable. And the United States has played a leading role in the international community to try to facilitate a diplomatic resolution to the situation there, at least to just try to reduce the violence and increase the consistent flow of humanitarian relief.\nAnd I understand that at some point later today, and maybe even right now, the United Nations Security Council is meeting to consider such a proposal. Obviously, if this ends up being a proposal that will result in a reduction in the violence and an increase in the provision of humanitarian assistance, then it's something that the United States will not just enthusiastically support but we're going to be actively encouraging all parties to support it, and actively encouraging all sides to implement it effectively so that the people in Aleppo who have been suffering in unthinkable circumstances can finally get some measure of relief.\nQ: You talk about the Syrians, and the Russians, and the Iranians and what they've done, but a lot of the anger over what's happened in Aleppo is directed at this White House and this presidency. Do you think that's fair? Why do you think that is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I think I'm going to refrain from criticizing people who are having an emotional reaction to the terrible violence that they have faced. And their feelings of anger and frustration I think are entirely understandable given what they've been through. And I think it would be inappropriate and maybe even immoral for me to stand here and criticize them.\nWhat I will say is something that you've heard me say before, which is that President Obama has -- and Secretary Kerry -- have been at the leading edge of a tireless effort to try to bring that violence to an end, or at least reduce it enough that humanitarian assistance can get to those people that need it the most. And this administration and this President certainly makes no apologies for that tenacious pursuit of the kind of solution that would bring relief to the suffering people of Aleppo.\nAnd it's not particularly surprising to me, given this long-running, bloody conflict, that the people of Aleppo are angry that this hasn't been solved more quickly.\nQ: Related to the rest of the world -- I mean, I guess the question is, why do you think that U.S. military action in Iraq can bring out millions of people onto the streets around the world, but Russian and Iranian actions in Aleppo don't have the same response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think it's hard to paint with a broad brush about how the international community is responding to this situation. I think that you have seen many moral consciences aroused by the violence in this part of the world, and it shows itself in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is the photograph of a small boy in the back of an ambulance who has barely escaped a Syrian government bomb. There was a pronounced public reaction to that photograph.\nThese kinds of images do tug at the conscience of people around the world. It certainly tugs at the conscience of everybody in the Obama administration, and that's why the Obama administration has pursued so tirelessly the kind of diplomatic solution that would bring that violence to an end. And that's what we're seeking, and hopefully we'll be able to make some more progress on that at the U.N. Security Council today.\nYes, ma'am, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Hi, Rosslyn Jordan with Al Jazeera, following up on his point on Aleppo.\nMR. EARNEST: Nice to see you, Rosslyn.\nQ: Hi, nice to see you. The civil war in Syria has been going on for almost six years.\nMR. EARNEST: It has.\nQ: The estimates between the U.N. and various human rights groups is that at least 400,000 to 470,000 Syrians have been killed. At least 32,000 of those people have been killed in Aleppo. Some of those people have been on social media. They've been able to go on TV today. They fear they are living the last days or hours of their lives. And they are asking: Where is the world? In particular, where is the United States?\nAnd the question is -- and I understand that the President did not want to launch a regional war -- but if ever there were an argument -- say, human rights advocates -- to act on the responsibility to protect, Syria is that situation. Why did not the administration intervene militarily in the Syrian civil war?\nMR. EARNEST: Rosslyn, the answer is simple, and it's one that we've said on a number of occasions: There's no military solution to the civil war in Syria.\nQ: But how can (inaudible) the job?\nMR. EARNEST: But, Rosslyn, what is the military proposal that has been tabled that would effectively prevent those deaths? Is the suggestion that somehow the United States should just occupy the nation of Syria? Do we really think that's going to reduce the violence in Syria? I don't think there's any evidence to substantiate that claim, even if that's one that is being made. I haven't heard any other sort of suggestion. The only solution is a diplomatic one, and no country in the world has expended more of an effort to pursue that diplomatic solution than the United States of America.\nThe United States has a special responsibility because we have the most influential, strongest country in the world. And we readily accept the responsibility, certainly under President Obama's leadership -- we've readily accepted responsibility for working through the international community and using that influence to try to bring that violence to an end.\nThe United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance. We've provided substantial resources to try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of Syrians who are fleeing violence, and there has been a substantial U.S.-military commitment to organizing the international community to try to address some of the consequences of the chaos in Syria, and that is the extremism that has fueled so much terrorism in that region of the world.\nBut when it comes to addressing and solving the underlying violence and chaos, that is ultimately a political question and a political that's needed. It's the failed political leadership of Bashar al-Assad that has brought us to this point. And it's resolving that political problem that will be necessary to definitively end the violence and ensure that the people of Aleppo, who have been under siege for years, can get some relief.\nQ: But the question has to be raised: Given how often Secretary Kerry has personally lobbied the Russian government, has personally lobbied the Foreign Minister, Mr. Lavrov, as recently as this weekend, and yet, oh, this isn't the right time to have a ceasefire, the United States is simply protecting the rebels who are holed up in Aleppo -- at some point, shouldn't this administration be calling Moscow's bluff and actually forcing them to do what they have promised to do, which is to call back the Syrian military and prevent them from committing what some are now alleging are human rights violations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we've indicated before, the United States strongly supports and would support an effort to ensure that the Assad regime, and those who are culpable for the Assad regime's actions, accountable for the tactics that have been used inside of Syria. Far too many innocent lives have been lost, women and children included, and we believe in some accountability. And hopefully that is something that the next administration will continue.\nBut when it comes to Russia, they've spent significant amounts of credibility in trying to describe to the international community their response to this situation. And as we discussed earlier, as Brett referenced, the Russians regularly like to say that they are focused on taking ISIL fighters off the battlefield in Syria, but the truth is they've taken their eye off that ball, and the one measurable gain that they've previously been able to point to against ISIL has now been rolled back.\nSo I think it is very difficult not just to justify, but even to explain what sort of strategy Russia is trying to pursue inside of Syria. Well, maybe I should say it this way: It's hard to reconcile their explanations about what they're doing inside of Syria with the truth.\nThe truth of the matter is, they're focused on propping up the Assad regime, and the Assad regime is trying to bomb civilians into submission so that he can try to get control over his country again. He's lost control over his country, he's lost legitimacy to lead. And the concern from the United States isn't just about the humanitarian situation there, it's about how that chaos has fueled extremism and given life to terrorist organizations that threaten the United States and our interests around the world.\nSo this is a complicated problem, but we're attacking it from every angle. And you heard from Brett the efforts that we're undertaking and that are making significant progress against ISIL. But the role for diplomacy and the leading role that the United States has played in pursuing that diplomacy to address the political situation in Syria is something that we've been pursuing for years and continues to this day.\nQ: Is this administration considering in its final weeks any punitive actions against Vladimir Putin's government because of its ongoing support -- militarily, financial, diplomatic -- for Bashar al-Assad's government?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a range of steps that we have been considering. And the truth is, because of some of Russia's actions in Ukraine, violating the territorial integrity of that country, they're already facing significant isolation that has eroded their status diplomatically and has hurt their economy.\nSo Russia is already suffering the consequences of the kind of international behavior that has been repudiated by the international community, but I wouldn't rule out potentially applying additional steps because of the way that they have behaved in Syria, as well.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:33 P.M.

This precious experiment in self-government only works when we have selfless citizens like you.\"\n-- President Barack Obama\nOur Nation's civil servants are making Government smarter, faster, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. They're partnering with leaders and advocates from State and local levels to help ensure the voices of the American people are heard. They're finding ways to process health benefits applications for disadvantaged tribal populations more efficiently and effectively, and making important strides in ending veterans' homelessness. They've worked to swiftly transport American aid workers with Ebola to the United States for life-saving treatment, and helped engineer a new spacecraft that could carry humans farther into space than we've ever seen before. They run airports and embassies, take care of troops and their families, defend the Nation's borders, make sure roads and railways are designed and built safely, and advance the frontiers of science and innovation.\nAmerica's Federal workforce relentlessly pursues the mission of bringing lasting change to the lives of ordinary people across America, often at great personal sacrifice and in the toughest of circumstances – including a politics that does not always fully recognize the value of their work.\nToday, the President issued a video message thanking Federal employees for their service, and recognizing the enormous difference they make in the lives of Americans. To celebrate the accomplishments of the Federal workforce, today the Administration is releasing a list of examples demonstrating the impact Federal employees have had in making Government work better for the American people, whether by leveraging technology, helping local leaders realize their goals and visions, advancing the frontiers of science and innovation, increasing access to opportunity for all, or driving efficiency in Government operations. The list, while not comprehensive, shines a light on the some of the Nation's civil servants great and most lasting achievements over the past eight years.\nWe encourage you to tune into the livestream today at 10:00 AM ET to watch senior Administration officials at the White House discuss the importance of public service and announce the President's 2016 Customer Service Award winners.\n***\nLEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER BETTER SERVICES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nFederal workers are leveraging technology to deliver a Federal Government that is smarter, savvier, and more effective for the American people. These efforts include:\nØ Helping students choose the right college. Federal employees have built a new tool – The College Scorecard – to help students, families, and their advisers make better decisions about where to go to college. The new tool includes the most comprehensive, reliable data ever published on students' employment outcomes and success in repaying student loans. More than 1.7 million people have visited the College Scorecard, and the data powering the College Scorecard has been accessed over 14 million times through the College Scorecard API.\nØ Helping consumer shop for the mortgage that's best for them. Through the Know Before You Owe initiative, Federal employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau simplified the mortgage disclosures consumers receive when purchasing a home. The new forms replaced existing federal disclosures that often contained duplicative and sometimes confusing information. Millions of consumers are now receiving these forms when shopping for a mortgage and are receiving information to understand their options, choose the deal that's best for them, and avoid costly surprises at the closing table.\nØ Reducing airport security wait times. Business and leisure travelers seeking to move more efficiently through airport security and customs can apply to participate in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Trusted Traveler programs, such as TSA Pre?® and CBP Global Entry. Today, the Pre?® program, which Federal employees at TSA began in 2011, has more than 4 million enrollees. Passengers enrolled in Trusted Traveler programs, who receive TSA Pre?® expedited screening, save millions of hours annually in airport security wait times.\nØ Making it easier for small businesses to get loans. Through its  Startup in a Day initiative, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is cutting red tape to make it easier for more entrepreneurs to get started and grow their businesses. Over 100 cities, home to 38 million Americans, have taken a public pledge to streamline their business startup processes, allowing entrepreneurs to better navigate requirements, with the goal of making it possible to file everything needed within a single day. In addition, 52,000 small business borrowers have connected to lenders under a new online SBA tool called LINC, and another new digital tool,  SBA One, is taking SBA's lending process entirely online, saving hours of time and thousands of dollars per loan for entrepreneurs.\nØ Making it easier to start a farm business. While just 500,000 Americans call themselves beginning farmers and ranchers, in just the first few months of launch, more than 600,000 individuals visited  usda.gov/newfarmers – and many more have since – making it one of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) most visited new online services. Using the smart and responsive New Farmers Discovery Tool, users can generate tailored options based on where, when, and how they want to farm – what used to take days of research, multiple phone calls, and multiple emails, Americans can more easily start down the path of connecting with key resources for their farm business in less than a few minutes.\nØ Modernizing export assistance for small business owners. A U.S. small manufacturer or service provider now can calculate tariffs applicable to their exports in 3 steps with the Free Trade Agreement Tariff Tool, access new export finance products with reduced application processing times, and use upgraded trade programs that have helped more than 6,700 businesses join the U.S. exporter ranks from 2010 to 2014.\nØ Better providing critical safety information during a disaster. Individuals and families are better able to protect themselves from disasters and emergencies, thanks to a new App developed by Federal employees at FEMA. The app prepares individuals and families by providing access to safety tips, weather alerts, reminders of important actions to take to prepare before a disaster, and checklists of important supplies to have on hand. The app also provides lifesaving information when disaster strikes to assist survivors with maps of open shelters and recovery centers, and resources for additional assistance that might be needed.\nØ Improving detection and tracing of foodborne outbreaks. The food supply is safer for consumers because of \"GenomeTrakr,\" a first-of-its-kind network of labs using whole genome sequencing to detect and trace foodborne outbreaks back to their source. Spearheaded by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), GenomeTrakr promises to speed foodborne illness outbreak investigations and reduce foodborne illnesses and deaths.\nØ Empowering customer access to energy use data. Today, millions of households and businesses can use Green Button to access their own energy usage data from their electric utility, and a growing set of companies are offering products, services, and applications that use Green Button data. The Green Button provides detailed customer usage information available for download in a simple, common format, helps to ensure that consumers have timely access to their information that can help them better manage their energy use and take advantage of opportunities to help reduce costs.\nØ Ensuring More Americans Have Access to Their Own Health Data. The Administration's Blue Button initiative helps individuals view, download, and send health data to applications and services they trust. In response to the President's call to action, an estimated 150 million Americans now have the ability to access their health records online, and a majority of healthcare providers are now  providing access to health information online.\nADVANCING THE FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\nAmerica continues to be the world's most innovative country, with the greatest potential to develop the industries of the future and harness science and technology to help address important challenges. Federal employees are making important contributions to advance the frontiers of science and technology, including:\nØ Improving accuracy and timeliness of weather forecasts. There has been a significant improvement in weather radar, average tornado warning times across the country have improved threefold, and tornado warning accuracy has roughly doubled. For hurricanes, the National Weather Service is now using an upgraded Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model that can now produce forecast guidance out to five days in advance for up to seven separate storms simultaneously.\nØ Developing improved atomic timekeeping for advanced technologies. Americans rely on advanced technologies like cellular telephones, GPS satellite receivers, and the electric power grid, which depend on the high accuracy of atomic clocks. The civilian time standard is about three times more accurate today than in 2008, thanks to the work of Federal employees at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop the NIST-F2 cesium atomic clock, which debuted in April 2014 and would neither gain nor lose one second in about 300 million years.\nØ Expanding the capabilities of robotic space missions. The aggressive pursuit of advances in Earth observations and long-term monitoring have led to a diverse array of space-based missions now providing new insights into Earth's interconnected natural systems through studies of Earth's atmospheric composition, carbon cycle, and climate. Federal employees worked to bring to fruition the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory in February 2015, which now resides one million miles away from Earth providing a unique, continuous view of our planet and serving as an early warning system for solar magnetic storms. In space science, in addition to the continued support of missions already underway—such as the Curiosity rover now exploring Mars, the New Horizons spacecraft that took the most detailed photos of Pluto in history, and the James Webb Space Telescope slated for launch in October 2018. Federal employees at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have also initiated work on the next generation of technologies to explore and understand the universe. The Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope and the first mission to explore Jupiter's moon Europa are in early stages of development.\nØ Improving accuracy and currency of weather forecasts. In October, 2014, Federal workers transitioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) operations to its Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, which helps forecasters manage the high volume of available weather data. The MRMS system generates products every two minutes, streamlining large amounts of data from multiple sources to provide more accurate and complete weather forecasts than traditional, single-radar systems. Using MRMS, NWS forecasters can pinpoint the location of severe thunderstorms, hail swaths, tornado tracks, and heavy rainfall. Because MRMS provides better depictions of high-impact weather events such as heavy rain, snow, hail, tornadoes, and other threats, forecasters can quickly diagnose severe weather and issue more accurate and earlier warnings.\nØ Improving tornado forecasting. Due to investments made by the National Weather Service in its network of radars, average tornado warning times across the country have nearly tripled, and tornado warning accuracy has roughly doubled. In 2015, residents of Rochelle, Illinois had 27 minutes of warning prior to an EF4 tornado compared to 25 years ago when the same community would have had 5 minutes – or no warning at all – to find shelter.\nPARTNERING WITH LOCAL LEADERS TO HELP REALIZE THEIR GOALS AND VISIONS\nFrom Fresno, CA, to Detroit, MI, to Corbin, KY, Federal leaders are working hand-in-hand with local stakeholders to achieve meaningful progress in communities. Federal employees are coordinating behind the scenes, breaking down silos and building partnerships to meet communities' biggest priorities?—?from creating community-built greenhouses that boost innovative agriculture, to re-lighting city streets and bringing new businesses to formerly vacant downtowns. Here are some examples:\nØ Revitalizing downtown Fresno, CA. In Fresno, collaboration through the Administration's  Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative helped cut the unemployment rate nearly in half and chronic homelessness has dropped by over 50 percent. Federal staff regularly attended meetings at City Hall, partnered with local community leaders, and worked across agencies to unlock federal funding, attract new resources to support downtown revitalization, and incorporate best-in-class city planning practices for Fresno.\nØ Building a brighter future for Detroit through Federal-local teamwork. In 2011, President Obama charged an interagency Federal team with coordinating support for Detroit's economic recovery. At that time, less than half of the city's 88,000 streetlamps were operational. A member of the federal team recruited technical expertise from the Department of Energy to help Detroit's new Public Lighting Authority consider long-term alternatives to replacing the outdated, broken lights. Working together, they used data on what worked to improve lighting technology in other communities, and brought together leaders from cities that had undergone conversions to energy-efficient LED lighting. Today, Detroit is 100 percent re-lit with new LED energy efficient lighting technology, saving the City 46 million kilowatts of energy every year, nearly $3 million in annual electricity costs, and reducing emissions by the equivalent of 11,000 cars.\nØ Drawing businesses back to downtown Corbin, KY. Local leaders had a vision to bring the Whitley County Farmers market, vendors, and live music to downtown Corbin, KY. Federal employees from six Federal agencies came together through the Local Food, Local Places program to streamline assistance and help Corbin bring a new Whitley County Farmers market downtown. This move helped drive the downtown vacancy rate down from over 40 percent to less than 5 percent, as vendors graduated to storefronts, opening over 20 new businesses that now benefit from higher foot traffic downtown.\nØ Helping Little Rock, Arkansas realize its visions for a more prosperous future. Like many American cities, Little Rock's Main Street experienced sharp economic decline over the last several decades. In 2010, Federal teams from the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) came together and teamed up with Little Rock through the Partnership for Sustainable Communities and Greening America's Capitals Program to align transportation and affordable housing investments alongside environmental protection efforts. Federal, state and city leaders worked with Little Rock's residents and businesses to turn downtown Little Rock's vacant lots into pocket parks, line streets with mini gardens, and expand an existing trolley line. Federal employees from the National Endowment for the Arts helped the City continue making improvements to Main Street through the Our Town Grant Program. Today, the City has developed a brand new, award-winning ‘Creative Corridor' along Little Rock's Main Street, and has leveraged several million dollars in new funding for cleanup and green infrastructure improvements.\nØ Working with local leaders to put Williamson, VA, on a path to creating a healthy, vibrant future. In 2012, local leaders worked with the Appalachian Regional Commission and Federal employees from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Livable Communities in Appalachia program. They formed a group called Sustainable Williamson to help turn around the future of Williamson, WV. With technical assistance from Federal employees and federal funding from across multiple agencies, a formerly vacant building on Main Street was renovated to create the Williamson Health and Wellness Center and provide health care services, nutrition education, and physical activity classes for residents who didn't otherwise have access. The Center established a downtown farmer's market and community gardens and a Health Innovation Hub to support new health and local food entrepreneurs. Now diabetic patients at the Center have access to health care, physical activity, and fresh food, and are seeing health improvements. New businesses are starting up in the downtown, bringing new energy and people to downtown. And Williamson is on a path to creating a healthy, vibrant future.\nØ Assisting local leaders in Choctaw Nation to navigate various Federal programs. In 2014, Choctaw Nation was designated the first tribal Promise Zone, partnering with dozens of federal agencies to improve quality of life for its people. Federal leaders, including a full-time staff member assigned to the local community, have assisted local and tribal leaders in navigating Federal programs to help pursue projects such as community-built greenhouses and new kitchen equipment in public schools to offer healthier meals.\nØ Streamlining Federal Engagement to address local crises. Teams of Federal employees have worked intensively in over 20 high-need cities, regions and tribal nations around the country. These teams align resources from across the Federal government and work behind the scenes to build local talent and capacity so that communities like Detroit and Baltimore can emerge from crisis. The Johns Hopkins University 21st Century Cities Initiative published a Federal-Local Partnerships Playbook, drawing on the experience of Federal teams in these communities.\nINCREASING ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL\nFederal employees are finding innovative ways to ensure Americans have the foundation and opportunities they need to build a strong economic life. From opening up data to empower families to helping schools become connected to high-speed Internet, the work of Federal employees is helping increase access to opportunity for Americans nation-wide. This work includes:\nØ Expanding STEM education for military families. With leadership from Federal employees at the Department of Defense and the National Math and Science Initiative, 60,000 military children in 200 schools around the country will get the opportunity to take STEM Advanced Placement courses, meeting the goal announced at the launch of Joining Forces in 2011.\nØ Taking Steps to End Veterans' Homelessness. Through 2010's Opening Doors, the first-ever Federal strategic plan to end Veteran homelessness, Federal workers, working closely with State and local leaders, took action to prevent Veterans from becoming homeless, help those who are homeless become stably housed as quickly as possible, and give service members the supportive services they need to remain stably housed. The 2016 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count—a \"snapshot\" of homelessness on a given night in America - shows that homelessness among Veterans is down by nearly 50 percent since 2010.\nØ Unlocking the talents of more high-skilled immigrant workers, scientists, and engineers. The Administration has strengthened and extended on-the-job training for international STEM graduates from U.S. universities. Approximately 34,000 individuals are participating in the STEM Optional Practical Training program at present, and with these improvements the total may expand to nearly 50,000 in the first year and grow to approximately 92,000 by the tenth year of implementation. The Administration has also allowed the spouses of certain high-skilled immigrants to put their own education and talents to work and contribute to the American economy during the time that these \"Americans in waiting\" are stuck in lengthy green card backlogs. From May 2015 to now, more than 35,000 spouses have obtained work authorization through this new policy.\nØ Supporting millions of students with ConnectED. Over the last 3 years, an additional 20 million U.S. schoolkids have become connected to high-speed Internet, and the number of schools that lack high-speed connectivity has been cut in half. At the same time, more than 3,000 superintendents, representing over 19 million students, have signed the Future Ready District Pledge committed to foster and lead a culture of digital learning in their districts. Federal employees at the Department of Education, in coordination with the Future Ready coalition of more than 50 national organizations, held 19 summits and workshops around the country to help teachers and leaders leverage digital tools and 25 states have launched Future Ready statewide initiatives. In addition, more than 5 million students are utilizing more than $2 billion worth of hardware, software, and mobile broadband resources provided by the private sector for ConnectED.\nØ Accelerating efforts to meet the digital needs of low-income Americans. Through the ConnectHome initiative—led by HUD— Federal employees are creating platforms that will provide home-based Internet access, digital literacy training, and devices to families with school-age children living in HUD-assisted housing in 28 pilot communities to initially reach thousands of children low-income households. Under the ConnectALL initiative, the President issued a national call-to-action in March 2016 to connect an additional 20 million Americans to broadband by 2020. This initiative will bring together Federal agencies, the private sector, and non-profit organizations to help close the digital divide.\nØ Expanding access to resources and services that families and communities need to thrive. The Opportunity Project is putting Federal and local open data and digital tools in the hands of families, community organizations, and local leaders to help them navigate information about neighborhood-level resources such as access to transit, housing, parks, and quality schools. Read  more.\nDRIVING EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS\nBuilding a Government that works smarter, better, and more efficiently to deliver results for the American people is a cornerstone of the President's Management Agenda, and Federal employees are turning this vision into reality. By harnessing 21st Century technology and innovation, Federal employees are driving efficiency in Government operations and maximizing the use of each taxpayer dollar spent. Here are some examples:\nØ Streamlining the Federal Government's buying practices. Through the launch of category management government-wide, an innovative approach that draws on best practices in both the public and private sectors to streamline Federal buying practices, Federal employees are shifting the Federal Government from managing purchases individually across thousands of procurement units to buying as one. As a result of these efforts, the Federal Government has saved more than $2 billion through category management and is on track to save an additional $3.1 billion by the end of next year. Prices have dropped by as much as 50 percent since 2015. Federal agencies have seen the number of duplicative contracts drop by 25 percent. By the end of 2016, 45 percent of the civilian agency portion of the $1.4 billion spent in annual purchases for desktops and laptops will be consolidated into three government-wide contracts.\nØ Optimizing the use of Federal real estate. Through the Administration's Freeze the Footprint policy, Federal employees are \"freezing\" the Federal Government's real estate footprint and restricting the growth of excess or underutilized properties -- disposing of existing property to support new property acquisitions. Between FY 2013 and FY 2015, the government's office and warehouse portfolio  declined by 24.7 million square feet. Through full implementation of the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and the Reduce the Footprint policy, Federal workers are on track to reduce the government's real property footprint by an additional 61 million square feet between FY 2016 and FY 2020.\nØ Saving time and taxpayer money by going paperless. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service manages and operates approximately 85 percent of all Federal payments, and in FY 2010, 82 percent of payments and associated information were settled on paper. Treasury set a goal to transition to electronic transactions, and worked to modernize the payment and collection systems to improve efficiency and save taxpayer dollars. By FY 2013, Federal employees at Treasury reduced paper benefit payments from 131 million in 2010 to 39 million in 2013 -- more than 70 percent -- saving nearly $500 million in taxpayer dollars. This year, paper benefits have decreased to fewer than 18 million.\nØ Improving acquisitions for better technology. The TechFAR Hub, developed by Federal employees, provides resources to apply industry best practices to the world of digital service acquisition across the Federal Government. The module features tools, resources, and lessons for planning and executing a digital service acquisition and enables users to ask questions and share best practices with colleagues across government, improving the Federal Government's acquisition practices for the benefit of the American people.", "timestamp": "2016-12-13", "title": "Press Release - Impact Report: Celebrating America's Federal Workforce"}

In his remarks, he referred to Rep. R. Eugene Green. Vice President Biden referred to his daughter Ashley B. Biden. H.R. 34, approved December 13, was assigned Public Law No. 114-255.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119915", "text": "Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. President——\n[At this point, Vice President Biden addressed former State Sen. David Grubb of West Virginia, who introduced the President and Vice President Biden, and his wife Katherine, both of whom remained on the stage. The Grubbs' daughter Jessica died of a drug overdose on March 2.]\nVice President Biden. It's a lousy club, but I'm proud of you. We're all proud of you.\n[Vice President Biden resumed his formal remarks as follows.]\nVice President Biden. Mr. President, my Senate colleagues, all the Members of Congress who are here and worked so hard to get this bill done today, just let me say that last week I had the honor of presiding, probably for the last time in the United States Senate, over the Senate as, Mr. President, they moved to pass the 21st Century Cures Act. And as I said, it's probably one of the last times that I will get to preside over the Senate and maybe one of the most important moments in my career.\nOn behalf of the administration, let me thank all the bipartisan leadership here. I want to make this clear: This bill would have never occurred, not for some of the—without the leading voices, Republican voices, in the House and the Senate, as well as Democrats. It would have never, ever occurred. And I hope this bodes well for what will come next year, that we're back working together. This was—this is a consequential piece of legislation that was extremely important, it cost a lot of money, and it was done in the lame duck session.\nWithout the true bipartisan support, this piece of legislation would have never occurred, and it's going to help millions of people—millions of people. As the President and I talk—he'll talk about this in greater detail in a moment—the 21st Century Cures Act is going to harness America's best minds—science, medicine, and technology—to tackle some of our biggest and most complex health challenges of today.\nThe bill commits $6.3 billion over 7 years, dealing with opioid addiction, precision medicine and the BRAIN Initiative and mental illness, Alzheimer's disease and so much more. But, Mr. President, if you'll excuse—as we both have just done—a point of personal privilege, I want to thank my colleagues. Of that $6.3 billion, $1.8 billion will go and be invested in cancer research and care.\nWhen the President asked me last year at the State of the Union to head the Cancer Moonshot, we said we were going to ask you all for significant funding increases at NIH and the National Cancer Institute. And you all stepped up again, Republicans and Democrats. As part of the moonshot, we set up what's called a blue ribbon panel to review what should be the scientific priorities as we tackle this to try to end cancer as we know it, try to do in the next 5 years what ordinarily take 10 years.\nThese priorities include investing in promising new therapies like immunotherapy, using the body's own immune system to target and kill cancer cells; enhancing prevention and detection efforts in every community, regardless of the ZIP Code in which you live; supporting research to improve outcomes for children with cancer; and putting us on a path to turn what is currently a devastating cancer diagnosis into either a chronic disease or an absolute cure. And in the process, it will fundamentally, I believe, change the culture of our fight against cancer and inject an overwhelming sense of the urgency, or, as the President often says, the urgency of now. And because every single moment counts, as Senator Murray and everybody else who's worked on this bill knows. God willing, this bill will literally—not figuratively, literally—save lives.\nBut most of all, what it does: Just this mere signing today, Mr. President, as you know better than I do, gives millions of Americans hope. There's probably not a one of you in this audience or anyone listening to this who hasn't had a family member or friend or someone touched by cancer.\nAnd I want to particularly thank my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, who moved, Mr. President, as you know, to name this section of the bill after our son—Jill, who's here with me today—our son Beau. As we used to say in the Senate, a point of personal privilege, Mr. President, do you know he loved you? And you were wonderful to Beau. And he spent a year in Iraq, came back a decorated veteran, and he was attorney general of the State, and he never, ever, ever gave up. Nor did we.\nAnd we had access to some of the best doctors in the world, including the head of the Department of Neuro-Oncology at MD Anderson, our—become a great friend of ours—Dr. Al Yung. Al, thank you for being here. But you know, as I said, we never gave up. But Jill and I realized that we're not the only family touched by cancer. And so many are touched who don't have nearly the support system we've had. And, Mr. President, you lost your mother, and so many other families in here have lost someone to cancer.\nAnd as I said, this legislation is going to give hope. Every day, millions of people are praying: praying for hope, praying for time, praying that somehow something will happen just to extend their—they're not even praying for cures most of the time. Those of you who are doctors in the audience, how many times have you heard a patient say, \"Doc, can you just give me just 3 more weeks so I can walk her down the aisle,\" or, \"Just give me another 2 months; it's my first grandbaby, and I want see him or her born.\" It's all a matter of hours, days, weeks, months.\nAnd what we're doing here now is, this is going to accelerate exponentially, in my view, the kinds of efforts we can make right now, things that are at our disposal right now to extend life.\nLadies and gentlemen, I believe President Obama and my colleagues in the Senate—as I said, both parties—were motivated by the same commitment that—of after whom this moonshot was named. I mean, President Kennedy had talked about going to the Moon. The problem is, there is only one Moon, and there's 200-and-some cancers. [Laughter] But here's what he said. Here's what he said. He said, we are unwilling to postpone. We all here are unwilling to postpone—unwilling to postpone another minute, another day. And doing what we know is within our grasp, it shows the Government at its best, Mr. President, and it shows that our politics can still come together to do big, consequential things for the American people. I see my friend, Senator Hatch, who I worked with for years and years, had stood up in this. All—junior Senators, senior Senators, everyone came together.\nSo Jill and I are proud to stand beside you, Mr. President, as you sign this last law of our administration. I'm proud to have served with you, Mr. President. And your absolute commitment to changing the way in which we deal with our health care system, it's making—is going to make a big difference. And this particular bill is going to allow people to live, live longer, and live healthier. And so—but, most of all, Mr. President, I think it gives people hope.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, I always kid the President that when he asked me to join him on the ticket and my daughter came home at lunch—she's a social worker—and she said: \"Did he call? Did he call?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"You said yes, didn't you, Daddy?\" [Laughter] And I said, \"Yes, of course I did.\" And she said, \"This is wonderful.\" She said, \"You know how\nyou're always quoting Seamus Heaney about hope and history rhyming?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" She said, \"This is hope and history.\" I'm history, here's hope. [Laughter]\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [Applause] Oh, no need. Thank you very much. [Applause] It's all of them. Thank you. Please, have a seat. Thank you so much.\nWell, welcome to the White House, everyone. It's December, so it's holiday time around here, and we thought it was a good occasion to have one more party. [Laughter] And this is a celebration worth having.\nI want to, first of all, thank Joe Biden and Jill Biden and their entire family, who have been such extraordinary friends to us. And what a fitting way for us to be able to signify our partnership as our time comes to an end together. It makes me feel very good.\nI want to thank David and Kate Grubb for sharing their family's story. As David said, we have a lot in common, and nothing more than the love of our children, our daughters. When I first met them in Charleston, their story was, unfortunately, more common than we would have liked. And I indicated a number of the people on this stage are people who have gone through tough times or have seen their loved ones suffer, either because of opioid addiction or because of cancer; who have bravely shared their story and channeled their passion into increasing the urgency all of us feel around this issue.\nAnd so, more than anything, this is a testimony to them and an extraordinary commemoration of those that they've loved. So we're very grateful to them. Please give them a big round of applause.\nWe're joined by a whole bunch of Members of Congress here today. And it is wonderful to see how wellDemocrats and Republicans in the closing days of this Congress came together around a common cause. And I think it indicates the power of this issue and how deeply it touches every family across America.\nOver the last 8 years, one of my highest priorities as President has been to unleash the full force of American innovation to some of the biggest challenges that we face. That meant restoring science to its rightful place. It meant funding the research and development that's always kept America on the cutting edge. It's meant investing in clean energy that's created a steady stream of good jobs and helped America become the world's leader in combating climate change. It meant investing in the medical breakthroughs that have the power to cure disease and help all of us live healthier, longer lives.\nSo I started the 2016 State of the Union Address by saying we might be able to surprise some cynics and deliver bipartisan action on the opioid epidemic. And in that same speech, I put Joe in charge of mission control on a new Cancer Moonshot. And today, with the 21st Century Cures Act, we are making good on both of those efforts. We are bringing to reality the possibility of new breakthroughs to some of the greatest health challenges of our time.\nJoe has already indicated some of the scope of the bill, but let me repeat it, because it's worth repeating. First, this legislation is going to combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that is ravaging too many families across the country. This is an epidemic that can touch anybody: blue collar, white collar, college students, retirees, kids, moms, dads. I've had the chance to meet people from every stage of recovery who are working hard to sustain the progress that they're making. And I've met parents like the Grubbs, who work tirelessly to help a child struggling with addiction. It could not be clearer that those of us called upon to lead this country have a duty on their behalf, that we have to stand by them; that, all too often, they feel as if they're fighting this fight alone instead of having the community gather around them and give them the resources and the access and the support that they need.\nSo today I could not be prouder that this legislation takes up the charge I laid down in my budget to provide $1 billion in funding so that Americans who want treatment can get started on the path to recovery and don't have to drive 6 hours to do it. It is the right thing to do, and families are ready for the support.\nSecond, the Cures Act provides a decade's worth of support for two innovative initiatives from my administration. Now, the first is the BRAIN Initiative, which we believe will revolutionize our understanding of the human mind. And when I sign this bill into law, we'll give researchers new resources to help identify ways to treat, cure, and potentially prevent brain disorders like Alzheimer's and epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and more.\nAnd we're also going to support what we've called our position—Precision Medicine Initiative, an effort we started to use data to help modernize research and accelerate discoveries so that treatment and health care can be tailored specifically to individual patients. This spring, with the help of this legislation, the National Institutes of Health plans to launch a groundbreaking research cohort, inviting Americans from across the country to participate to support the scientific breakthroughs of tomorrow.\nNumber three, the Cures Act improves mental health care. It includes bipartisan reforms to address serious mental illness. It takes steps to make sure that mental health and substance-use disorders are treated fairly by insurance companies, building on the work of my Presidential Task Force. And it reauthorizes, meaningfully, suicide prevention programs. Many of these reforms align with my administration's work to improve our criminal justice system, helping us enhance data collection and take steps so that we're not unnecessarily incarcerating folks who actually need mental health assistance.\nFourth, we're building on the FDA's work to modernize clinical trial design so that we're updating necessary rules and regulations to protect consumers so that they're taking into account this genetic biotech age. And we're making sure that patients' voices are incorporated into the drug development process.\nAnd finally, the Cures Act invests in a breakthrough effort that we've been calling the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. And I think the Senate came up with a better name when they named it after Beau Biden.\nJoe said Beau loved me. I loved him back. And like many of you, I believe that the United States of America should be the country that ends cancer once and for all. We're already closer than a lot of folks think, and this bill will bring us even closer, investing in promising new therapies, developing vaccines, and improving cancer detection and prevention. Ultimately, it will help us reach our goal of getting a decade's worth of research in half the time. And as Joe said, that time counts.\nIn this effort, Joe Biden has rallied not just Congress, but he has rallied a tremendous collection of researchers and doctors, philanthropists, patients. He's showing us that with the right investment and the ingenuity of the American people, to quote him, \"There isn't anything we can't do.\" So I'd like everybody to just please join me in thanking what I consider to be the finest Vice President in history, Joe Biden. [Applause] Go ahead and embarrass Joe. Go ahead. [Laughter] Hey! [Applause] Why not! So we're tackling cancer, brain disease, substance-use disorders, and more. And none of this work would have been possible without bipartisan cooperation in both Houses of Congress. A lot of people were involved, but there are some folks who deserve a special shout-out. That includes Senators Alexander and Senators Murphy; Representatives Upton, Pallone, and DeGette and Green. And of course, we couldn't have gotten across the finish line without the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, who are here, as well as leaders from both Houses: Speaker Ryan, Leaders McConnell and Reid, and Senator Patty Murray. Not to mention all the Members of Congress who are sitting here that I can't name; otherwise, I'm going to be here too long, and I will never sign the bill. [Laughter] But you know who you are.\nI want to thank all of you on behalf of the American people for this outstanding work. These efforts build on the work that we've done to strengthen our health care system over the last 8 years: covering preexisting conditions, expanding coverage for mental health and substance-use disorders, helping more than 20 million Americans know the security of health insurance. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, it means they have access to some of the services that are needed.\nI'm hopeful that in the years ahead, Congress keeps working together in a bipartisan fashion to move us forward rather than backward in support of the health of our people. Because these are gains that have made a real difference for millions of Americans.\nSo this is a good day. It's a bittersweet day. I think it's important to acknowledge that it's not easy for the Grubbs to come up here and talk about Jessie. It's not easy for Joe and Jill, I know, to talk about Beau. Joe mentioned my mother, who died of cancer. She was 2½ years younger than I am today when she passed away.\nAnd so it's not always easy to remember, but being able to honor those we've lost in this way and to know that we may be able to prevent other families from feeling that same loss, that makes it a good day. And I'm confident that it will lead to better years and better lives for millions of Americans, the work that you've done. That's what we got sent here for. And it's not always what we do. It's a good day to see us doing our jobs.\nSo with that, I think it's time for me to sign this bill into law.\n[The President signed the bill.]", "timestamp": "2016-12-13", "title": "Remarks on Signing the 21st Century Cures Act"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119784", "text": "(New York, NY) – President-elect Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to name former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy.\nGov. Perry was the chief executive of one of the country's largest states and one of the largest economies in the world. He is also one of the most successful governors in modern history, having led Texas through a sustained period of economic growth and prosperity by developing the state's energy resources and infrastructure, and making low-cost energy available to companies and families.\n\"As the Governor of Texas, Rick Perry created created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as Secretary of Energy,\" said President-elect Trump. \"My administration is going to make sure we take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation, and Rick Perry is going to do an amazing job as the leader of that process.\"\n\"It is a tremendous honor to be selected to serve as Secretary of Energy by President-elect Trump. I am deeply humbled by his trust in me,\" said Gov. Perry. \"As the former governor of the nation's largest energy producing state, I know American energy is critical to our economy and our security. I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the development, stewardship and regulation of our energy resources, safeguarding our nuclear arsenal, and promoting an American energy policy that creates jobs and puts America first.\"\nWith his executive experience, Gov. Perry will carryout President-elect Trump's vision to make America energy independent, create millions of new jobs, and protect clean air and water.\nGov. Perry has devoted his entire adult life in service to America and to creating prosperity and opportunity for families. He is a veteran of the United States Air Force, a former farmer, and the longest serving governor in Texas history, having led the world's 12th largest economy from 2000 to 2015.\nPerry grew up the son of tenant farmers in the tiny West Texas community of Paint Creek. The younger of Ray and Amelia Perry's two children, he was active in scouting and earned distinction as an Eagle Scout. He was one of the first in his family to go to college, earning a degree in Animal Science from Texas A&M University, where he was also a member of the Corps of Cadets and a Yell Leader.\nBetween 1972 and 1977, Perry served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East. He is a lifetime member of both the NRA and American Legion Post #75. Prior to being elected Lieutenant Governor in 1998, he served two terms as Texas Commissioner of Agriculture and three terms in the Texas House of Representatives.\nAs the 47th governor of the Lone Star State, Perry championed conservative principles that helped Texas become America's economic engine by cutting taxes, controlling spending, making regulations fair, smart and predictable, and stopping lawsuit abuse. Under Gov. Perry's leadership, Texas became a national leader for job creation, innovation and population growth.\nPerry married his childhood sweetheart, Anita, in 1982.

Ted Cruz (R-TX):\n\"Gov. Perry will make a terrific Secretary of Energy. For 14 years, he led the State of Texas, and with low taxes, restrained spending, and limited regulation, Texas became one of the greatest economic powerhouses in the world. His executive experience across diverse policy areas makes him qualified to run just about any federal agency. Gov. Perry is an exceptional pick to head the Department of Energy, and after presiding over the nation's number one producer of oil and natural gas, and one of the nation's leaders in wind, solar, and nuclear energy, he understands the importance of our country's energy resources not only to our economy, but also to our national security. I am confident that Gov. Perry will be an aggressive champion for opening more lands to exploration and working to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources. I enthusiastically support his nomination as Secretary of Energy.\"\nU.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and is a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\"Rick Perry is a first class public servant. I have known and worked with him for years. I look forward to learning more about his plans for supporting energy research, strong national laboratories and supercomputing that help give America its competitive edge in creating jobs.\"\nU.S. Sen Jim Inhofe (R-OK):\n\"Rick Perry is an excellent choice to lead the Department of Energy. Perry understands the abundance of our domestic energy resources and what it takes to power our complex and growing economy. I am confident that under his leadership, the DOE will be right sized and focused intently on its twin goals of national security and energy independence. American economic dominance cannot be achieved without our continued responsible use of natural gas, oil, coal, and nuclear resources. I congratulate my good friend Rick Perry on his nomination and look forward to working with him.\"\nSalo Zelermyer, former Senior Counsel at the Energy Department:\n\"It is indeed possible to successfully balance appropriate environmental regulations with domestic energy production and use.\n\"During his time in office, Perry embodied the type of 'all of the above' approach to U.S. energy production that many have advocated on both sides of the aisle. Rick Perry's Texas was not only a world leader in oil and gas production; it was also a global leader in wind power and renewable energy investment. This approach is a big reason Texas experienced such enormous job growth during Perry's tenure.\" (Washington Post)\nT. Boone Pickens:\n\"Rick Perry is a friend. He was a great Texas governor, and I believe he will be a great Secretary of Energy.\n\"Believe me, the man understands energy. He's been a long-serving Texas governor who has witnessed first-hand what natural gas and oil mean to the state and national economies and the workforce.\n\"He also presided over Texas during a time in which deregulation and transmission projects enabled wind energy production in the state to grow from 184 megawatts of installed capacity in the year 2000 to over 14,000 megawatts at the end of 2014. Texas continues to be the largest producer of wind energy with now over 17,700 megawatts of installed capacity followed by Iowa with 6,200 megawatts of wind energy.\n\"He understands what happens to the oil and gas industry with too much government regulation and he understands how important domestic production is to our economy and our national security.\"\nTom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association:\n\"He increased the ambition of the state's Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a 'Competitive Renewable Energy Zone' that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.\" (Science Mag)\nLarry Faulkner, professor of chemistry and president emeritus of the University of Texas in Austin:\n\"I found him to be interested in scientific research and technical innovation and to be willing to support investment in them. His interest was usually driven by the possibilities for economic opportunity for the state, which is not surprising for a governor.\" (Science Mag)\nKen Kimmell, President of the Union of Concerned Scientists:\n\"As governor of Texas, Mr. Perry saw the job creation and business opportunity provided by clean energy, helping to turn Texas into the national leader in wind power. In fact, he increased the ambition of the state's Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a 'Competitive Renewable Energy Zone' that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.\n\"We hope as DOE secretary, Governor Perry builds on the successful work currently underway at the agency in areas like grid modernization, energy efficiency, and clean energy finance. Most important is that he supports the agency's critical work on clean energy R&D, which has helped create jobs by improving the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies, and help develop and commercialize new, innovative clean energy technologies.\"\nHerman Cain:\n\"His 14-year track record governing the state of Texas - with its aggressive and smart use of natural resources and its general tendency to avoid crony capitalism - has established the state as an economic model for the rest of the nation.\"\nGeorge P. Bush, Texas Land Commissioner:\nCongrats to Governor Perry for being nominated as Energy Sec--as Texans we know he'll fight to return sensible policy making to the States. (Twitter)\nDavid McIntosh, Club for Growth President:\n\"Rick Perry will be a strong advocate for free-market energy policies, and the most important pro-growth step he could take at the Energy Department would be to fulfill his 2012 campaign pledge to eliminate it. The DOE is little more than the government's own venture capital firm for energy-related activities, and it's time for the cronyism end. Governor Perry has a prime opportunity to serve taxpayers by closing its doors.\"\nMatt Schlapp, American Conservative Union Chair:\n\"Gov. Rick Perry is our kind of leader for the Dept of Energy. American energy will fuel an American jobs resurgence.\"\nJim DeMint, Heritage Foundation President:\n\"Governor Perry's commitment to free-markets, limited government and a stronger America, make him an exceptional choice to head the Department of Energy. While the department plays a critical role in our nuclear weapons program, its vast loan programs, crippling regulatory actions, and market interventions represent the federal government overreach that Americans sharply rejected in November.\n\"For well over a decade, Governor Perry successfully led the state of Texas - one of the world's largest economies - with a confident conservative vision that created millions of new American jobs.\n\"I am confident Governor Perry will fight to keep America's nuclear deterrent strong while also reining in the department's overreaches - allowing Americans to once again determine their own energy futures.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-14", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Praise for Former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119850", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:20 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you. I do not have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nJosh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. I wanted to start with the collapse of the ceasefire in Aleppo that was intended to allow these final civilians and fighters to evacuate. It seems like this deal was essentially brokered by the Turks and the Russians without a whole lot of direct U.S. involvement. So I'm wondering at this point whether -- if you could tell us what kind of engagement the U.S. is involved in in trying to ameliorate the violence there or secure the evacuation of the people who are still trapped there.\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, for years, the United States has played a leading role in trying to facilitate a diplomatic solution to the situation in Syria, including the situation in Aleppo. And our goal all along has been to reduce the violence and create space for sustained humanitarian assistance to be provided, particularly to those communities that have been under siege by the Syrian military, aided and abetted by the Russians and the Iranians.\nSo the United States continues to play that leading role even today. And I know that there were discussions at the U.N. Security Council, and the United States continues to push for a diplomatic agreement. We certainly encourage other countries to be involved as well, and we've made clear that our efforts to reach a bilateral agreement with the Russians, which is something that we tried for many weeks earlier this year, is not something that we could achieve because the Russians couldn't hold up their end of the bargain. And I know they've got all kinds of explanations for why that may be the case. Most of them are rooted in the fact that they are either unable or unwilling to control their client government.\nQ: But as far as right now, hour by hour there's pummeling of Aleppo, even when there's supposed to be this ceasefire. I mean, is there any new push or specific engagement by the U.S. to try to restore the ceasefire?\nMR. EARNEST: There is continued engagement, and there has been for years, and it continues to this moment. And we continue to be deeply concerned about the situation in Aleppo. We are seeing the same reports that you are -- that innocent people are being slaughtered in the streets at the hands of the Assad regime, aided and abetted by the Russians and the Iranians. And it raises deep concerns, and it's a deeply tragic situation. And these atrocities have to come to an end. And we're working diligently through a variety of diplomatic channels to bring about that end state.\nQ: There seems to be some disagreement now, even within the intelligence community, about whether the evidence that's been turned up supports an assessment that Russia was actually trying to influence the election in a way to help Donald Trump. Can you tell us -- I know you have limitations about what you can talk about -- but whether the President has been informed by his Director of National Intelligence that they do not concur or embrace what the CIA has concluded about that?\nMR. EARNEST: When it comes to CIA conclusions or intelligence community conclusions, I'm going to refer you to the intelligence community. And there's a variety of reasons for that. The first is that we work hard to make sure that we are insulating the intelligence community from the suggestion that they are subject to political influence. It's important that the President be in a position to get good information. And when I say good information, I mean timely, accurate information about situations all around the world. And I certainly don't want to do anything or say anything from here that could cast doubt about the integrity of the information that's being provided to the President of the United States.\nSo when they have an assessment to offer, I'll let them offer up that assessment. What they have said, and what they've said before the election, is that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity in an attempt to erode confidence in our system of government. And that's deeply troubling and very serious. And that's why the President ordered the Department of Homeland Security to work with elections administrators across the country to protect those systems and to bolster their ability to withstand intrusions from Russia so we could ensure the accurate counting of ballots, and we could ensure that everybody who was eligible to cast a ballot could do so.\nAnd the intelligence community has reported that on Election Day they did not see the kind of increase in malicious Russian cyber activity that would call into question the casting or counting of ballots. That certainly is good news. But there is rampant evidence of other tactics that were used by the Russians to erode public confidence in our democracy. And that's deeply troubling, and that's why the President has ordered a review, and the intelligence community is working on that review, and the President's expectation is that review will be delivered before the President leaves office, before January 20th. And we're certainly going to endeavor to release as much information as possible from the review to the public as we can, knowing that there will be some things that we can't release because we need to protect the ability of the intelligence community to collect this information.\nQ: Given that the mixed signals about this is sort of fueling a politicization of the intelligence work, certainly with the President-elect, and given that you've said that this review that's taking place is basically the primary distinguishing factor between that and the assessments that had already been done, is that it's looking back into previous elections and sort of doing this holistic thing -- has the President indicated that he would like the intelligence community to perhaps release additional information or maybe clear what exactly they think happened sooner than later, perhaps sooner than that culmination of that review, which doesn't seem like it will happen until perhaps as the President is headed out the door?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a timeframe. The President certainly believes that as much information can -- the President believes that the intelligence community should release as much information as they can to the public about this issue, given how serious it is, given that we're talking about the integrity of a national election. So the President certainly does support that just on principle. But I don't have an updated timeframe to share in terms of what the intelligence community may or may not be able to do.\nQ: And then just quickly, Reince Priebus has been out today talking about mixing it up a bit here at the White House as far as how the press corps interacts with the White House, and possibly doing away with assigned seating here in the Brady Press Briefing Room. And so I just wanted to clarify for everyone, could you tell us whether your office has any say or control over the seating assignments here in the briefing room?\nMR. EARNEST: We do not. This is -- I believe this was -- it certainly predates President Obama's presence in the White House. The White House Press Corps has worked among yourselves to organize the seating arrangements in this room, and I certainly would recommend to the incoming administration that they collect and familiarize themselves with some basic facts as they consider what sort of policies to implement moving forward.\nRoberta.\nQ: A senior Chinese official warned today in China Daily that the Chinese government is ready to penalize a U.S. automaker for price fixing, and I'm wondering what notice the U.S. government has been given about this and what concerns the White House has, if any, about this.\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta, I've seen those reports. I don't have a lot of other information that I can share. We're still trying to collect additional information about those specific reports.\nI think what I can say definitely is that the Obama administration has a strong track record of making sure that we are protecting the rights and interests of U.S. businesses around the world, including in China. And as we learn more information about this particular situation, the United States government will continue to be protective of our interests in that circumstance and in other circumstances around the world.\nQ: Do you see this as a response to the President-elect's sort of tough rhetoric on Chinese policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Unclear. I can't speak to why China may or may not have made this decision. Again, I think it's unclear exactly what the decision is. And until we can figure out what exactly that decision is, it makes it hard to consider exactly what their motive may have been.\nQ: Okay. And taking a step back just from the decision, whatever it may be, I guess how concerned in general is this White House, this administration, that there could be economic repercussions for U.S. companies because of the stepped-up rhetoric against Chinese policies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this goes to an argument that I have put forward when I was previously asked about this issue. The longstanding U.S. commitment to a one-China policy, this is a policy that's governed by a piece of legislation and three different communiquйs that were signed into law by Democratic -- or were signed -- by Democratic and Republican Presidents. This is a policy that has been observed for 40 years or so. And China considers their relationship with Taiwan to be a highly sensitive issue, and signaling potential changes in that policy is going to have widespread ramifications for the United States, both as it relates to our economy and as it relates to our national security.\nSo certainly the incoming administration has an opportunity to consider what sort of policy they believe is in the best interest of the United States. I think the suggestion that all Americans would have is that they consider those kinds of choices very carefully before acting.\nAnd in this case, the President-elect indicated in an interview over the weekend that he took the call based on an hour or two's notice. And I think this is one illustration of how important the role of the presidency is and how important discipline and careful consideration of one's words and actions is when you're President of the United States and responsible for advancing our interests around the globe. So I'll leave it there.\nMichelle.\nQ: We heard the retired NATO commander talk about the situation in Syria, and though he had served under Obama, he said that Obama would probably look back on that situation with deep sorrow and some shame. What do you think of those words that he said?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see those comments. I can tell you that, under President Obama's leadership, the United States has been at the front of the effort to find a diplomatic solution to the situation in Syria. The United States has provided more humanitarian assistance through bilateral channels than any other country in the world. We have provided $6 billion in relief. And the United States has mobilized the international community to respond to the threat that is posed by ISIL, which essentially is a consequence of the chaos inside of Syria.\nSo President Obama has been making smart, strategic decisions that protect carefully U.S. interests in the region and around the world. That said, I think every American and every human being is deeply troubled by the violence and innocent loss of life that we see inside of Syria. It's heartbreaking. It's tragic when you see a government commit atrocities against its own people using the military might of the state. That is a failed government. That is a failed state. And President Obama has been leading the international effort to address it, both by trying to find a diplomatic solution to the chaos, but also dealing militarily and otherwise with the extremist threat that is propagated by that kind of chaos.\nQ: I don't think anyone disputes the efforts. But for a very long time now, those efforts have failed. So is there no other alternative?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's be clear. You got a briefing for a long time from the President's Special Envoy to the Counter-ISIL Coalition that documented the success that we've had in rolling back ISIL and reducing their capacity to harm the United States or our interests, either in the region or around the world. So I would vigorously dispute that characterization of our efforts against ISIL.\nWith regard to making the kind of progress that we'd like to see toward a diplomatic solution inside of Syria, we haven't seen as much progress as we would like. And there are innocent Syrian men, women and children that have died as a result of it. And ultimately, that cause is the willingness of the Assad regime to use the military might of the state against his own people, and the willingness of the Russians to intervene on his behalf to prop him up, even though they themselves claim that they're concerned about that chaos fueling extremism that could have consequences back in their home country.\nThey should be concerned about that. And for years, the Russians have failed to reconcile a basic contradiction in their strategy. They say, on the one hand, that they're interested in trying to fight extremism and bring the violence to an end in Syria, even at the same time that they prop up the failed government there that exacerbates the violence and makes the diplomatic solution even harder to reach.\nThere's one good example of this -- there are some reports -- reports I can't confirm, I have to start out by saying -- but I think are illustrative of what Russia has done. Russia, nine months ago, touted publically their success in taking back the Syrian community of Palmyra from ISIL terrorists. Well, we have learned that ISIL has retaken that city from the Syrians and the Russians. In doing so, they didn't just succeed in driving out the Syrian government and the Russians; ISIL now has their hands on a significant anti-aircraft missile system. This is according to reports so I can't confirm it. But it does illustrate, if true, the grave danger associated with Russia's failed strategy.\nTheir strategy, if they're actually interested in fighting terrorists, should not involve an anti-aircraft missile system because ISIL doesn't have an air force. So what that anti-aircraft missile system was doing in Palmyra is something that only the Syrians and the Russians can explain, but it does underscore the grave risk that Russia is taking by dedicating their resources to attacking innocent civilians in Aleppo and propping up the Assad regime, and taking their eye off the ball when it comes to ISIL.\nIn this case, their miscalculation was so grave that it's not just a matter of them ignoring the ISIL threat. The ISIL threat today -- again, if these reports are true -- is worse because of the failed strategy of the Syrians and the Russians. And that's something that only they can account for.\nQ: When we use words in here repeatedly like \"atrocities\" -- I mean, you just said today that innocent people are being slaughtered in the streets -- it just seems like you're saying that -- have we gotten to a point now that there really aren't any red lines anymore? Like, it's as if it's gotten to a point so many people have been killed, and now because of social media and other means, Americans are watching this happen, and many people thinking humanity as a whole should be better than this. So at what point do nations say, okay, something needs to be done now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the Assad regime has demonstrated that they've crossed all the lines in pursuit of their goals. And those goals apparently include depraved tactics like trying to starve innocent civilians into submission, bombing hospitals and playgrounds, targeting them. These tactics are depraved. They do cross just about every line that I can think of. And, frankly, they cross lines I hadn't previously thought of.\nThe idea that you would target a playground and bomb kids, hoping that you would then convince people to give up because you had killed their kids -- what kind of a sick mind comes up with a strategy like that? And what kind of civilized country is going to support those tactics? But that's what Russia has done.\nQ: So for the families that we actually hear begging for international help, what do you say to those families today?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States is playing a leading role in providing financial assistance. The United States is playing a leading role in trying to negotiate a kind of cessation of hostilities what would allow for the provision of humanitarian assistance. The United States is playing a leading role in trying to facilitate a conversation about resolving the political situation inside of Syria so we can bring the violence to an end, and we can put new leadership in Syria that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people. And in that chaos, that's what the United States is doing.\nWhat we're also doing is engaging militarily to protect the international community and the American people from the threat that is posed by ISIL. And we've made a lot of important progress against it. But we have not accomplished our goal so far.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Has the President spoken with Labor Secretary Perez about the DNC chairmanship?\nMR. EARNEST: Dave, I've seen some of the reports about Mr. Perez's interest in that position. I can't confirm them. And I don't have any additional conversations between the President and his Labor Secretary to tell you about at this point.\nWhat I can tell you is something that I've said before which is that Democrats across the country have an important decision to make about who will assume the role of leading the national Democratic Party. And I would expect there will be a vigorous campaign. I know that there are already three or four candidates that are in the race. But I don't know if Mr. Perez intends to be one of them.\nQ: The President over the years has obviously valued Secretary Perez's leadership in the administration. Does he think he'd be good at the DNC chairmanship?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's certainly true that President Obama thinks very highly of Secretary Perez. He is somebody who has served at the Department of Labor for three or four years now. And he has been instrumental in advancing some of the executive actions that President Obama has prioritized.\nAt the Department of Labor, they've worked to implement the overtime rule to ensure that the hardest-working Americans are getting paid fairly and even getting a raise. Under Secretary Perez's leadership, the Department of Labor has implemented the conflict of interest rule that prevents large financial institutions from not acting in the best interest of their clients, and we know that some of those practices cost working people billions of dollars every year.\nWe're trying to bring that to an end, and we've made progress in doing so because of the leadership and effectiveness of Secretary Perez. He's somebody who hasn't just effectively led that department, he also is somebody who is a forceful and persuasive advocate for the values that animate the policies that he has implemented.\nSo he's a very effective guy. The President thinks highly of him. But as I've said before, I don't anticipate a situation in which the President forcefully endorses a candidate in the DNC chair's race simply because the President's view is there are rules and regulations that sort of lay out how the DNC chair should be elected when there's not a Democrat in the White House. And the President believes that that process, which involves Democrats all across the country at a variety of levels, engaging in that debate is healthy for the party over the longer term.\nQ: Do you have any knowledge whether the Vice President's office might have been encouraging him to get involved?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any conversations that Secretary Perez may have had with Vice President Biden, but you can check with his office.\nQ: One other issue. Governor Brown from California yesterday wrote to the President asking for him to ban all new offshore drilling in the state. And there are reports also that the administration might be ready to ban offshore drilling in the future in the Atlantic. Can you let us in on plans for either ocean?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the letter, but let me see if we can get you a substantive response to your question.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about comments coming up today by Secretary Jewel. This is according to reporting out of Reuters, my colleagues down the row here. \"Scientists must confront climate change deniers and speak up if President-elect Donald Trump tries to sideline climate research.\" Is that the President's position that scientists should speak up if they disagree with the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's view is that policymaking should be guided by science and that policymakers should be listening to scientists, both inside the government and outside the government. That's the President's view and that's certainly the way that he has chosen to run his administration over the last eight years. If the incoming administration determines that they want to base their policy on something other than science, it looks like they're going to get at least four years to try that out and we'll have an opportunity to see how it works.\nQ: Do you believe that it's appropriate for Secretary Jewel to sort of weigh in in this respect before she's actually heard from the President-elect officially on the job? She seems to be making the suggestion that his administration will somehow ignore that which the scientists -- whether it be the EPA or the Interior -- have already established.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think based on some of the comments that we've seen from the people that the incoming administration or the President-elect has chosen to serve in important positions like the EPA and the Department of Energy, I think the concerns that people across the country and around the globe have expressed about the incoming administration's commitment to focusing and continuing the fight on climate change I think are legitimate questions at this point.\nQ: What can you tell me about the \"Investing in a Safer, Strong Baltimore: A Model for the President's Approach to Working with Cities\" report?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me take a look at the report. I don't know that I've seen it, but we can certainly take a look into it.\nQ: Okay. Last, I want to get the very latest on the Gitmo numbers. I typically ask you about this time -- is there a plan to transfer more? What's the latest tally and/or is the President expected to make another round of transfers between now and when he leaves office? And should we expect him to also comment on this as we hear from him later in the week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't rule out additional transfers between now and January 20th. There is a process that is in place that was instituted by this administration where the case files of individual detainees are considered by six different national security agencies. And based on the view of those agencies, individuals can be cleared for transfer under certain security restrictions that would limit their ability to menace the United States or our interests around the world.\nOnce those individuals are cleared for transfer, then the State Department does the delicate work of asking countries around the world to assume the responsibility of taking on these detainees and imposing the security restrictions. And that work is continuing. I don't have any transfers to preview, but every time a detainee is transferred, we make a public announcement about it. And that will also be true between now and January 20th.\nQ: Is it also true that the United States pays these countries to receive these detainees, these transferees? And what's that number like, and who tracks that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that the United States works closely with these other countries to ensure that there are security restrictions in place. I can't speak to all of the negotiations that go into it, but certainly in some cases, we're talking about countries that benefit from the assistance of the United States and making sure that those security restrictions are effectively implemented. And that's consistent with the mandate of these agencies that review the case files to ensure that restrictions are put in place to prevent these individuals from posing an undue risk to the United States of America.\nQ: Last, I'd like to get your sort of expanded comments on something Ben Rhodes talked about, and that is the continued relations between the United States and Cuba, and the importance moving forward. What is the President's message? And will he reach out directly to the President-elect about the importance of maintaining that relationship and some of the pitfalls that come along with that, given their lack of human rights and other concerns that many people around this country have?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. Well, listen, Kevin, we've got concerns about the human rights situation in a lot of countries around the world, including some countries like China and Russia that we've already spent a lot of time talking about today. The question really is, how do we shape those relationships so the United States benefits from them? How can we shape those relationships so that we can put pressure on those countries to improve the human rights situation inside their country while at the same time giving the American people the opportunity and our country the opportunity to benefit from those relationships?\nSo when it comes to Cuba, the United States had had a policy in place for more than five decades that attempted to isolate Cuba in an effort to pressure them to improve their respect for human rights. That policy failed. That policy was in place for more than 50 years and it didn't have the desired outcome. So President Obama decided to try something new.\nAnd in just two years since the President decided to try a new approach that would seek to normalize relations between our two countries, we've made a lot of important progress. More than $6 billion in trade has been initiated between Cuba and the United States since then, which obviously has an important economic benefit here in the United States. More Cuban Americans are able to send more money and travel more frequently to Cuba to visit their family members who remain in that country. Other Americans who are interested in visiting Cuba for cultural or educational reasons can have the benefit of learning more about the island and essentially deepening relations between our two countries. Those Americans are also allowed to bring back as much Cuban rum and Cuban cigars as they'd like for their own personal use. So there are a variety of benefits, you might say, that the American people can enjoy as a result of this policy change.\nJust as importantly, the Cuban people are benefitting too. And we're seeing the Cuban economy -- particularly when it comes to entrepreneurs in that country -- benefit from more interactions with Americans who are traveling to their country.\nQ: But would that lead to a change in their human rights posture at all? I mean, because on the one hand you said, listen, the old policy didn't work as far as human rights were concerned. Now this new policy seems to be working perhaps economically, certainly for them, and I think, from a social perspective, perhaps even for the American and Cuban relations. But is that changing the paradigm on human rights?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is ramping up pressure on the Cuban regime. And earlier this year, many of you had the opportunity to travel to Cuba with the President where the Cuban President was asked directly and put in the international spotlight around a question about whether or not his government takes political prisoners.\nThat's increasing pressure on the Cuban government in a way that, frankly, they're not used to seeing. That was a rather remarkable, extraordinary event, those of you who saw it may recall. There were two different times in which an aide came onstage to whisper in the ear of the Cuban President about how best to answer this question because they understood they were facing more public pressure than ever before about their respect for human rights; certainly more pressure than they faced when they were under an embargo for more than 50 years. And that pressure was only existent -- only existed because of the President's trip down there and his commitment to the pursuit of this approach.\nI think the last thing is, if we're actually interested in trying to protect and advance the interests of the Cuban people, if we actually care about their plight, then we might consider what their view is of the policy. And all the public data that I've seen is that, in some cases, more than 90 percent of Cubans actually believe that this policy has been good for them.\nSo this is a policy that has only been in place for two years, and the President is hopeful that as this policy remains in place, we'll have more benefits to show from it. But of course, the next incoming President will have something to say about that.\nMargaret.\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power had some strong words, some strong rhetoric, about Syria and Russia in particular, and I want to ask if you agree with one particular thing she said. She said, \"Aleppo is joining Rwanda and Srebrenica as defining historical events that embody evil.\" Is that how the White House views what's happening right now in Aleppo -- comparing it to those two genocidal mass atrocities?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this actually is an area of expertise for Ambassador Power. She's written award-winning books on this topic, so I certainly wouldn't be in a position to disagree with her.\nThe kinds of atrocities that we've seen in Aleppo, as I mentioned earlier, seem to cross every line, including some lines that I think many of us had never even contemplated before. The willingness of the Assad regime, backed by the Russians and the Iranians, to engage in depraved tactics targeting innocent civilians is beyond the pale.\nAnd it certainly does -- the kind of chaos and violence and bloodshed and innocent loss of life that we've seen in Aleppo certainly does, tragically, distinguish it from so many other countries in the world -- and so many other cities in the world, I should say.\nQ: But using those two specific examples, they are very concrete examples that are now widely recognized as genocidal acts where the world community failed to prevent mass atrocity, and American presidents have, in past, then said, I regret not doing something then.\nSo it's a powerful comparison to make, and I'm just wondering, how does President Obama think about this? I mean, is he sitting there saying -- and putting it in the same category as Srebrenica, and putting it in the same category as Rwanda? And how does he feel? I mean, does he regret that this is happening on his watch?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as I mentioned in response to the earlier question, President Obama is deeply troubled by the innocent loss of life that we've seen in Aleppo and all across Syria. There's no denying that. That's why the President has played a leading role in the international community to try to bring that violence to an end. That's why we've been deeply engaged from the beginning in trying to find a way to bring this violence to an end, to negotiate the kind of political solution that's the only kind of solution that can solve this problem. A military solution cannot be imposed on this situation, unless of course somebody is suggesting that somehow the United States of America, on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, should deploy 100,000, 150,000 -- 200,000 U.S. servicemen and women to essentially occupy Syria. I don't know --\nQ: Iran and Russia do believe there is a military solution and they are seeing their version of a military solution play out on the ground in Aleppo.\nMR. EARNEST: At the same time that Bashar al-Assad does an interview today saying that the violence is going to continue.\nQ: Right. So not end the war, but certainly advantage the side that you want to win. But putting that aside, just talking about the atrocities -- not the rest of it -- President Obama did something really extraordinary when he came to office in saying that atrocities prevention is a national security priority. He was the first President to do that. You are now saying as an administration these two prime examples of ethnic cleansing, of genocidal acts are happening right now. And the action stops at rhetoric. How does the President process that?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I stridently disagree with the suggestion that the action stops at rhetoric. There's no basis.\nQ: But there were actions taken elsewhere, right? And President Clinton came out and said, I regret not doing something in Rwanda.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret, my point is --\nQ: There weren't actions taken in the Balkans. So it's not as --\nMR. EARNEST: When you say actions, you're using some shorthand for military action. If that's the case, then we should -- but you cut me off from trying to offer up why that's not a wise solution. So there is --\nQ: No one was advocating for invasion. I never said that, that that was the example you were doing.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, but you're suggesting why isn't there any action on the part of the Obama administration. And the case that I have made repeatedly so often that you guys can repeat this: President Obama has played a leading role in the international community in trying to find a diplomatic solution to this situation.\nYou all have covered it. You all have traveled frequently to locations throughout Europe where Secretary Kerry has met repeatedly with the Russians and other countries in the region to try to find a solution to this situation. Those meetings occurred because the United States is playing a leading role in bringing people to the table to try to negotiate this solution.\nThe United States is the largest donor of bilateral humanitarian assistance to try to meet the needs of the people who are suffering. The United States is in a position where we are taking military action to try to prevent the chaos that President Assad is causing in his country from fueling the kind of extremism that could pose a threat to the United States and our allies and our interests not just in the region, but around the world. All of those things are happening on President Obama's orders, as a result of his leadership, and they're the kinds of things that only a U.S. President can do given our influence around the world.\nSo that is what the United States is doing. I readily acknowledge that we are not seeing the results that we would like to see in addressing the violence inside of Aleppo. But it's offensive to suggest that somehow the United States government and the world is not doing anything, particularly when no one has put forward an alternative suggestion for what we should now be doing.\nRon.\nQ: I think the issue, Josh, is that people will acknowledge all that the United States has been doing -- humanitarian aid, so on and so forth, diplomacy -- but we are still at a place where the awfulness is still happening.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. And I --\nQ: And that's why the question becomes, okay, so the U.S. has done all that -- now what? Which is why yesterday Brett McGurk was saying the humanitarian, the civil war part of Syria was only addressed briefly in that meeting. Is that correct? It wasn't -- most of the meeting was about the ISIS part of this, ISIL part of it.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: And the Syrian civil war atrocities part of it was just brief. And I guess the question is -- the President just doesn't see anything more that the U.S. can do now to stop what's happening now despite all that you've done, all that he's done over the past number of years? There's just nothing else?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I --\nQ: Again, I know -- I hear you. But again, there's nothing new, nothing different, nothing that he thinks -- it's just a problem that can't be solved, or a situation that can't be ameliorated?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of anybody in the U.S. government who has given up trying to continue to play the leading role in finding a solution here. The diplomacy continues. And you can go talk to my colleagues at the State Department about all of the conversations and all of the work that is underway there.\nAnd the reason for that is not just because Secretary Kerry finds those conversations particularly enjoyable; I'm sure that he doesn't. But they are the only path to resolving the situation that exists. If there's another one, by all means, please send it up and we'll make sure that it gets a careful look, because even our harshest critics cannot articulate some sort of alternative for what is happening right now.\nAnd, again, if they think that the most powerful thing that we should do is to deploy the United States military and occupy the country, they should do so. They should explain how that's going to reduce the violence. That certainly is not our experience. They should explain how that is in the interest of U.S. taxpayers because that's going to be expensive. They should explain to our United States military why they should put themselves at risk in that way. And they should explain how that is part of a long-term strategy to protect our interests in the region. Because what we have found is when the United States engages in a ground war and tries to occupy a country in the Middle East, there are long-term negative consequences for doing that, including the situation in Syria right now.\nQ: And there's nothing short of a full-scale invasion? That, I guess, is what most people would just ask. I mean, we've heard -- we understand all that. And I also understand how you feel that your critics always say that if you're not doing something militarily, you're not doing anything. And I get that. But just talking to people -- there's nothing short of a full-scale invasion. And there was talk of safe zones. And during the campaign, Hillary Clinton, others, some of the allies in the region -- the Turks at one point -- were talking about that. I guess it's just hard for people to see the slaughter continue and there's not something else that can be done militarily that would, in the short term at least, stop some of the bloodshed.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me try to answer your question this way. I suspect if there actually were a military solution to this problem, depending on what it was, the Commander-in-Chief wouldn't hesitate to implement it. But there's not. And this is not a new position that is being articulated by the Obama administration. This is a position that we have had since the earliest days of the civil war in Syria. There is not a military solution that can be imposed by the United States. Diplomacy is the avenue. Diplomacy is the path toward a long-term resolution that is in the interest of the United States. And that's what we're pursuing. And, in fact, that's what we're leading.\nQ: It's the hesitancy that I think a lot of the critics point to -- this caution that is, yes, part of President Obama's approach to this -- approach to many things. And we've heard him argue how he has not hesitated in certain circumstances to deploy the military to do things in different places. I guess this is a question for him on Friday when he -- because, again, given what's happening, I guess we'd love to get a better sense of how he processes this. And I understand it's a tremendous responsibility, but how he processes the criticism, the concern that the world has about this situation at the same time that there's this criticism of him for being too cautious, too -- dare I say -- weak to do more.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think you should use that word because people certainly didn't think it was cautious when the President of the United States ordered the Seal Team Six into Pakistan to go and take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield. I don't think people thought it was cautious that the President has built an international coalition of 68 members to go and take the fight to ISIL. And you just got a long briefing yesterday, a timely one, that reveals the progress that we've made in rolling back territory from ISIL and taking their external plotters off the battlefield and limiting their ability to organize those kinds of operations and carry them out against the United States and our allies around the world.\nSo I think the President has been judicious and strategic, but he's also been bold. And the United States and our national security has benefitted from it.\nGardiner.\nQ: Why did it take until October 7th to attribute the hack to the Russian government when the hack on the DNC was confirmed in April, and from the first days investigators knew it had Russian ties? That delay covered most of the presidential election, causing months' worth of debilitating coverage of the leaks that were not properly informed by a formal government statement that this was an act of foreign espionage. Wasn't that a mistake to take so long?\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, this is an assessment that was put forward by the intelligence community, and the intelligence community put forward this statement as soon as they were able to confirm a couple of things. First, they had to confirm across 17 different government agencies that they had high confidence that this is exactly what had transpired.\nNow, I recognize that there was this independent, private analysis that had been put forward, but the standards of the intelligence community, for good reason, are very high.\nSecond, the intelligence community wanted to be as specific as possible in putting forward that assessment so that people could have confidence in the facts. In order to be specific, the intelligence community also had to ensure they would not be revealing the kinds of sources and methods that give them the insight that they need to conduct these investigations. So there was a determined effort to both be as specific as possible while also protecting the sources and methods that are used by the intelligence community to conduct these investigations.\nI think all in all, Gardiner, this was a statement that was put out a month before the election. So I would acknowledge that there were reports of hacks and leaks before that, but what also existed before that were private assessments about how that material was obtained. And there's no denying that those materials were stolen property. The suggestion -- there is no denial on the part of the U.S. government that somehow the DNC had not been hacked. So even as news organizations were reporting on this information, they were reporting on information that they know had been stolen and leaked.\nThose are editorial decisions that are made by independent news organizations, but even the excellent report that was included in your newspaper today about this incident makes clear that news organizations in the United States essentially became the arms of Russian intelligence.\nQ: But shouldn't those news organizations have been told months earlier? I mean, Josh, this is a new battlefield, and you're telling me that the U.S. government cannot respond on this battlefield for months, six months, until much of the damage as a result of this attack has already occurred? You're saying that it was appropriate to wait between April and October to allow the Russians to have their goals and aims achieved largely, and it wasn't until pretty much the last minute of the election that the U.S. government came out with something that might have changed news organizations decision-making about using this information? Why not do it before? And shouldn't you -- if you are not capable because of this wide-ranging review, shouldn't you change that review process?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think there's any evidence to indicate that editorial decisions changed as a result of the statement. So I think we actually do have an opportunity to evaluate that claim. So I think it actually is an open question about whether it would have made a difference. It didn't make a difference when we put out the statement a month before the election in the way that this was handled by news organizations.\nBut here's the other thing, Gardiner, and I think this is important, as well, as you consider the government response, and in particular the White House response to this situation. It would have been inappropriate for White House figures, including the President of the United States, to be rushing the intelligence community to expedite their analysis of the situation because we were concerned about the negative impact it was having on the President's preferred candidate in the presidential election. That would have been all the more damaging in an environment in which you have the Republican nominee, without evidence, suggesting that the election is rigged.\nSo what we were deeply concerned about from the beginning was making sure that we were protecting the integrity of the intelligence community and insulating the intelligence community from the kind of political pressure that was obvious to everybody who was reading the newspapers or watching television. It's important for our intelligence community to be shielded from that kind of political interference or political influence. We need --\nQ: It's just that he has -- that he's sort of paralyzed and can allow the Russians sort of open-field running as long as they attack in a way that the President himself feels awkward about intervening -- right? I mean, this was a Russian effort on the most important electoral process in the United States. And you're saying that the President himself had difficulty responding simply because of the politics of responding?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not ascribing any difficulty here. I'm merely stating the facts, which is that the President believed it was important for the intelligence community to formulate in advance of the election, if possible, the most definitive analysis that they could make public. And that's what they did -- a month before the election.\nUnfortunately, that didn't seem to change the way that this was considered or reported on by the media. So again, I think that's why it's difficult to say that maybe it would have been treated differently if the report had come out two or three or four months earlier, because it's not clear that when the report did come out that it had much of an impact on the way that it was -- in the way that this material was reported on.\nI also think this all underscores the risk of politicizing the intelligence community. There is a reason that when the review that the President has ordered is released in January will have some integrity. It will have that integrity because the President has gone to great lengths to protect the intelligence community from even the appearance of being used as a political weapon.\nAnd that has long-term consequences for the decisions that future presidents -- plural -- will make. They need to be able to count on the information that they're getting from the intelligence community being right and not being influenced by -- and by \"right\" I mean timely and accurate -- and not being influenced by partisan politics.\nQ: Is that the reason for the very differential response between what the President did after the North Korean Sony hack, in which he very forcefully and personally came out and addressed that, and this hack? Which it's a strange thing because this hack so clearly had far graver consequences and was so much more important to the country than the Sony hack, which he very publicly and forcefully came out and denounced.\nSo help me understand why those two very different responses by the President personally, and why he didn't respond to this one in the forceful personal way he did to the Sony one. Was it because of politics?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are two things at play here. The first is that the North Korea attack was, in many ways, more crude. And the President's statement in December of 2014 was also based on an intelligence assessment. So the statements that we have made as an administration have been driven by the facts and have been driven by the assessment of the intelligence community. And the intelligence community assessment with regard to the Sony hack was arrived at sooner.\nQ: And was more clear? Or is that --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'd have to talk to them, I think, about how they reached these conclusions. But in both -- in all cases, our administration is commenting on this based on the facts and based on the impartial, unbiased assessment of the United States intelligence community. And the American people benefit from having an intelligence community that isn't subject to partisan politics, even in the midst of the most hotly contested, divisive election in recent history.\nBut you raised a second question, which is sort of about the President's personal involvement. And the President did believe, given that he had endorsed a candidate in the political -- given that the President had endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, he believed it was important for the intelligence community to make this announcement. And that's why you saw a statement from -- a joint statement from the IC and from the Department of Homeland Security. Again, that was an effort to ensure that this information avoided even the appearance of being politically motivated.\nAnd the President had very strong feelings about the race and about the candidates who are involved in the race. And the President did not -- those of you who traveled with the President in the last four or five weeks of the campaign saw that the President didn't pull any punches in forcefully making an argument in support of his preferred candidate. And he believed that that political activity should be separate from the intelligence community's analysis of Russian malicious cyber activity.\nNow, what's also true -- and this goes to something that we discussed in the briefing on Monday -- there's ample evidence that was known long before the election and, in most cases, long before October about the Trump campaign and Russia -- everything from the Republican nominee himself calling on Russia to hack his opponent. It might be an indication that he was obviously aware and concluded, based on whatever facts or sources he had available to him, that Russia was involved, and their involvement was having a negative impact on his opponent's campaign. That's why he was encouraging them to keep doing it. You had the Republican nominee refer to the President of Russia as a strong leader. The Republican nominee chose a campaign chair that had extensive, lucrative, personal financial ties to the Kremlin. And it was obvious to those who were covering the race that the hack-and-leak strategy that had been operationalized was not being equally applied to the two parties and to the two campaigns. There was one side that was bearing the brunt of that strategy and another side that was clearly benefitting from it.\nNow, I know there's a lot of reporting that there may be some disagreement in the intelligence community about whether or not that was the intent. That's a question that they should ask and a question that they may attempt to answer, but there certainly was no doubt about the effect. And, again, it didn't require a security clearance or a consensus, high-confidence intelligence assessment to understand. And in spite of all that, that didn't change the way in which this information was reported on, either.\nQ: Josh, we've talked before here about this administration's retaliation or potential retaliation for these efforts. And we quoted a lot of experts in our story saying that basically you're making a mistake; that you didn't -- you haven't apparently retaliated against this attack and you continue to sort of say that any retaliation could be secret. They are saying that, first of all, you should have retaliated long before now and probably before the election, and that it shouldn't be a secret retaliation -- it should be very clear that the United States is retaliating against this to discourage this continued behavior.\nSo help me -- if you don't mind, defend the administration's decision-making on both not apparently retaliating so far, not retaliating before the election as a means of discouraging this continued behavior, and not guaranteeing that this retaliation would becoming public, which, again, according to these experts, would help discourage this behavior then and in the future.\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, what we have indicated is the President believes that based on what we know about what Russia did, that it merits a proportional response. From here, I'm not in a position to confirm whether or not that response has been initiated or not. I'm also not in a position to confirm that we won't ever in the future discuss what that response is or what that response may be. There may eventually be a point at which we do discuss what the response is, will be, or has been.\nJust trying to cover all my verb tenses there. (Laughter.)\nBut here's a couple of other things that are important to consider. Given the interconnected nature of our society and our economy, the United States is in the unique position vis-а-vis the rest of the world because we rely on 21st century communications technology for just about everything in a way that lots of other societies and economies and countries don't. So --\nQ: Are we particularly vulnerable?\nMR. EARNEST: We are -- the United States is particularly vulnerable. Now, that is counterbalanced by the fact that the United States is also more powerful when it comes to our cyber capabilities than any other country in the world. That's compounded -- the complexity of that situation is compounded by the fact that so much of this is new. When we're talking about international conflicts on the battlefield or in the open seas, there are decades and, in some cases, even centuries-long traditions and norms and treaties and understandings that have been negotiated and observed. And it sets up a framework for countries being able to avoid disagreements about what's appropriate behavior. And when those disagreements do arise, there is a codified system for resolving them.\nNone of that exists in cyberspace. And, in fact, the President has made this one of his top policy priorities is to begin to initiate a process in our discussions at the G20, in our discussions at the G7, and in our bilateral relations with other countries that have significant cyber capabilities to start to establish those rules of the road.\nAnd if you go back and look at some of the G20 communiquйs, you can see that there is a specific -- I know that's something you've probably already done, Gardiner, knowing how conscientious you are about covering these issues. So just to refresh your memory about how specific some of those efforts were in the context of the world's 20 largest economies, you'll also recall -- and this got more attention, understandably so -- when President Xi of China came to the White House for a state visit last fall, the fall of 2015, it was notable that he stood in the Rose Garden of the White House next to the United States President indicating his country's commitment to a norm in cyberspace that countries should not support cyber-enabled theft for commercial gain.\nAnd that is a norm that the United States had been previously concerned China was not willing to observe. I can't offer an updated assessment on how well they are observing that norm that the Chinese President stated. But it certainly addressed many of the concerns that had been justifiably raised by U.S. companies about how China was hacking their businesses, and then using proprietary technology and information to disadvantage U.S. businesses and to give Chinese businesses a leg up.\nSo establishing those norms in cyberspace is a priority. I just described an economic situation that has significant economic consequences for the country, but this also applies in the national security and homeland security realm, as well.\nSo I think that would explain a lot of this. Look, I guess there's one other -- you asked a lot of questions, so that's why I'm giving a long answer.\nQ: I've got one more, by the way.\nMR. EARNEST: Which is -- I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion, so I'm just trying to remember everything I wanted to say.\nThere's one last thing that I did want to say, which is one of the highest priorities that was identified by the President and his policy team in the fall, given the threat that was posed by Russian malicious cyber activity, was ensuring that the elections infrastructure of the United States was protected.\nNow, the thing that we acknowledged from the very first time that I was asked about this is that there are some built-in protections based on how diffuse the elections infrastructure is in this country. Cities, states, counties all have a role in administering elections. They use different systems for conducting those elections. That means that there's not one way to hack the entire election system of the United States. That makes our elections process complicated and messy and difficult to reform and improve. It also makes it harder to hack.\nQ: So hanging chads are a good thing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know if I'd go quite that far, but relying on paper ballots or hanging chads makes it hard for somebody who's sitting in a cubicle in Moscow to have an impact on the outcome, at least by tampering with the ballots. But the same goes to voter registration rules.\nNow, the concerning thing, Gardiner, was that we had detected some Russian malicious cyber activity on the systems of some elections administrators across the country, and this is where politics gets involved again. In most states, the people who are in charge of administering elections are themselves politicians. They're not impartial observers. They have an impartial mandate to ensure the conduct of a free and fair election, and the vast majority of them do that job and do it well. But if there was a perception that the Democratic President of the United States was raising some of these concerns about Russian malicious cyber activity because he was trying to protect the Democratic candidate for President, there is not likely to be a lot of cooperation between a Republican elections official and a Democratic administration.\nSo this administration went to great lengths -- we even went to Capitol Hill -- to try to convince Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to signal their commitment to setting aside partisan politics and focusing on the national security of the country, and issuing a joint public statement about how important it was for election administrators in both parties to work with the Democratic administration to protect their systems from Russian intrusion.\nDemocrats in Congress readily agreed this was a good idea. Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan did not readily agree to it. I'm not going to get into all of our private conversations, but this was an element of the story that was published in your newspaper today. And it's true, we didn't get the kind of prompt cooperation we would have liked.\nNow, we eventually did get a letter that the four leaders of Congress did agree to send to the organization that represents elections administrators across the country. And as a result, there were not a lot of charges and counter-charges that the Democratic administration was up to no good. And, in fact, experts at the Department of Homeland Security worked with elections administrators in 45, 46, 47 states to ensure that their systems were protected from Russian intrusions. And the good news is that the intelligence community was watching closely, and they determined -- or at least they did not observe an increase in malicious Russian cyber activity on Election Day that interfered with the casting or counting of ballots. And that obviously is good news. But that's not the whole question.\nQ: One more. Sorry to take so long. The GSA has released a letter stating that the Trump organization will be in violation of its lease on the Trump hotel site here in Washington the minute that President-elect Trump takes office if he doesn't fully divest himself of his holdings in the hotel, which he has shown no sign that he is doing. Was that appropriate for the GSA to do? And what responsibility does this administration have in ensuring that the incoming Trump administration abides by conflict of interest laws and the emoluments clause of the Constitution? Is this something you're working on in the transition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware that there's a robust role for this administration to play in this. I'd refer you to the GSA to explain the concerns that they raised about the contract that they have with the Trump organization. The relevant agency here is going to be the Office of Government Ethics. This is a nonpartisan, independent agency that is charged with ensuring that government officials -- federal government officials are abiding by all of the rules and restrictions that apply to the ethical conduct of people who are supposed to be serving the national interest.\nSo I think the proper role here is going to be with the Office of Government Ethics, with inspectors general who have independent oversight responsibilities in the executive branch. There's also going to be a critically important role for Congress. And the early indications, I think, leave me cautiously optimistic that Democrats and Republicans are prepared to play that oversight role to ensure that those who are entrusted with protecting and advancing the public interest are not compromised by their own personal financial considerations.\nObviously, President Obama has gone to great lengths to prevent even the appearance of having a personal financial conflict. President Obama sold all his stock and all of his outside interests before entering the Oval Office, and tied all that money into Treasury bonds. Given the aggressive way in which the Federal Reserve was reducing the interest rate, that was a very poor investment decision, but it was the right thing for the country. And that's kind of the point.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. Russia has figured prominently in a number of questions that you've received this week, whether it's related to the situation in Syria, or whether it's related to the alleged hack by Russia in an effort to influence our presidential election. Does the President have any plans to reach out, pick up the phone, speak to his counterpart from Russia, Vladimir Putin, and talk about some of the same issues that we're talking about all this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any calls that are planned. But obviously the President has had a number of occasions to see his counterpart and to talk to him about these issues. Obviously, the President saw President Putin for a brief period in Lima, Peru, when we were there for the APEC Summit -- I guess it was just last month. It feels like about a year ago. President Obama also had an opportunity to see President Putin in China when we were in China for the G20 meeting in September, the meeting of the world's 20 largest economies. And over the course of his time in office, President Obama has had conversations with President Putin on the phone and in person to\nAt this point, I'm not sure that there's a situation that they've talked about more than the situation in Syria. They've had multiple opportunities to do that. Obviously, there are even many more conversations that occurred between Secretary Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov. So there's been deep engagement with the Russians. But I'm not aware of any upcoming conversations between President Obama and President Putin. But if one does occur, we'll let you know.\nQ: A lot of conversation has occurred this week as it relates to President-elect Trump's decision to nominate Rex Tillerson as his Secretary of State. And a knock on him from a number of critics appears to be his preexisting relationship with Russia, his preexisting relationship with Vladimir Putin. Do you see this as a knock, or do you think it can be helpful to have a preexisting relationship with someone who figures so prominently in America's foreign affairs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, obviously, you have outlined the case that the Trump administration has made in favor of the nomination. There are others who have raised concerns about the wisdom of choosing someone who has been awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin to represent U.S. interests around the globe, considering the adversarial nature of our relationship with Russia on so many important issues.\nThere are some areas where we do effectively cooperate with Russia already and have done so to the benefit of the American people. But look, I'll let others make the argument on both sides. I think the argument that I would make is simply: People shouldn't be surprised. The President-elect ran on a platform of pursuing warmer relations with Russia. He indicated his frustration and signaled a potential lessening of our commitment to NATO. He referred to President Putin as a strong leader. So it shouldn't be particularly surprising that he chose someone who got the Order of Friendship medal from Vladimir Putin to be his Secretary of State.\nQ: Would that be a bad thing? U.S. relations with Russia are at perhaps the lowest level they've been since the Cold War, since maybe the early 1960s. Do you think that relations between the U.S. and Russia should remain at the level where they are right now, or do you think there is room for improvement with Russia, vis-а-vis the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I think what the President would say is that he would welcome additional opportunities to try to advance our interests by working with Russia. But that's going to require not additional concessions to Russia but a willingness on the part of the Russians to deal honestly with their American interlocutors in pursuit of their stated goals.\nSo, for example, just to go back because it's the most pertinent one, Russia says that they are committed to working with the international community, including the United States, to go after ISIL. There's no evidence for that. And, in fact, what Russia has done against ISIL has been rolled back and ISIL's capabilities have been heightened and worsened because of Russia's poor decisions.\nSo in some ways, until Russia signals a willingness to pursue a different approach in their relationship with the United States, I think we're going to encounter some choppy waters here. I think what President Obama has tried to do is to try to prevent our disagreements in some areas of Syria and in Ukraine from allowing us to make progress in some other areas. And whether that's our cooperation on the space program or the success that the United States and Russia had in eliminating the declared chemical weapons stockpile of the Assad regime. There are some areas where we are able to work effectively with the Russians, and the American people have benefitted from it.\nBut if we want to see more of that, I think we're going to need to see a change in behavior and a change in strategy on the part of the Russians.\nMaggie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Circling back to the Office of Government Ethics, they recently are urging Trump to act as if he must follow financial conflict of interest laws, but as Trump has pointed out, the President is not legally bound by these. Do you think it's time to update federal ethic laws to make sure that the President does have to follow these laws, that it's a law?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think all I can say to you is what President Obama has done, and as I described earlier, President Obama didn't just follow the ethics rules as if they applied to him -- he went far above and beyond them and made sure that there was not even the appearance of a conflict of interest when it comes to his personal finances. And he did that in a way that disadvantaged him financially but was good for the country because it erased any doubt about his true motivations.\nSo the President also believed that that actually benefitted his presidency because he wasn't in a position in which he was sidetracked by allegations of a personal conflict of interest. And he set a very high standard for ethics that people throughout his administration have followed. And it's why the President is quite proud of the fact that his administration has not been plagued by the kinds of major personal scandals that have plagued other presidencies.\nQ: So would you say then that the argument of selling a lot of real estate would make Donald Trump lose money is not a valid argument?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the incoming administration and the President-elect are going to have to make their own decisions about how they handle the situation. But if President-elect Trump were to sustain a financial loss in order to enter the Oval Office, he would not be the first one.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to go back to the comment you made about how people shouldn't be surprised that Donald Trump is selecting someone who has close ties to Russia given the fact that he said all of these things on the campaign trail that were seen as friendly to Russia. It kind of seems to stand in contrast to this idea that once Donald Trump leaves the campaign trail and gets into the office, he's going to be woken up by the realities of the office, and all of those sort of incendiary things he said on the campaign would not be the actual policies that he pursues. And that seems to be the message that the President was giving when he went overseas and spoke to NATO partners and other partners.\nSo what's the message? Is it that people shouldn't be surprised and they should brace for Trump to follow through on all of this rhetoric that he had on the campaign trail? Or is that -- the office will change him and he'll moderate on some of those positions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I think it's hard to assess, because you have in the past heard Mr. Tillerson say positive things about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement. So does that mean -- so I guess -- I cite those two examples to illustrate that we'll have to see. It's unclear. I think what we might be seeing now is that the President-elect cares more about his Secretary of State's position on Russia than he does about his Secretary of State nominee's position on trade and climate change.\nBut again, when you go back to the rhetoric of the Trump campaign, it's not particularly surprising that the President-elect appears to be prioritizing over a bunch of other important issues. But what that actually means for the kinds of policy they will implement, that's something that we'll all have to wait and see.\nQ: I also wanted to ask you about the -- give you another chance to maybe weigh in on the Energy Secretary pick. Obviously, President Obama selected a Nobel Laureate physicist in Ernie Moniz who -- you know, highly respected and --\nMR. EARNEST: Merely a physicist at MIT. (Laughter.)\nQ: Right. So I'm wondering if, given the fact that Moniz had such an important role in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, I'm wondering if the President has any thoughts about the former Texas governor becoming the next person for this position.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm really tempted to, but -- (laughter) --\nQ: Give in.\nMR. EARNEST: -- maybe if you want to come by and chat in my office, I've got some good zingers for you. But I think I will try to exercise some discipline and refrain from commenting any more than I already have, admittedly, about --\nQ: You could just tweet it.\nMR. EARNEST: If I can remember them all, I'll share them with you after this briefing.\nQ: I'll stay tuned for that.\nOne more on the stock market. Obviously, it's hitting record highs on a regular basis, almost at 20,000 in the Dow, and Donald Trump and his surrogates are claiming credit for that. Obviously, you all said there's only one President at a time, so I wondering if you have any thoughts on whether or not this rally has anything to do with the current President or the President-elect.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the significant number of market analysts who follow the market more closely than I do comment on individual market movements.\nI'll just make the broader observation that since the depths of the Great Recession that President Obama inherited, the stock market has more than tripled. We'll see if the economic policies that the incoming President implements have a similar positive effect.\nHe campaigned on vowing to try things differently. He campaigned on the idea that we need a different economic approach. And we've laid out a number of times -- and we're getting late here, so I won't do it again -- but we've laid out a number of times the benchmark that the incoming administration will have to live up to. And we'll see if they do. But an important of them is the stock market. And the stock market, since was at its nadir in the summer of 2009, has more than tripled. And we'll see if President Trump's economic policies have a similar positive impact on the market in a way that has a positive impact on the savings and retirement savings of millions of American workers.\nTaka, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. President Putin will visit Japan tomorrow to meet Prime Minister Abe. What do you expect from the meeting? They will meet in Japan twice, in Tokyo and in Prime Minister Abe's old prefecture. What do you think of Prime Minister Abe's decision to maintain warm relations with President Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, you know, President Obama, as I mentioned earlier, has had a number of conversations with President Putin over the last year. Obviously, Russia has faced some significant diplomatic isolation from the international community, including the G7, of which Japan is a member. We used to refer to that meeting as the G8, back when Russia was included in that meeting. They no longer are because of their willingness to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\nSo I can't speak to what may be on the agenda or what Prime Minister Abe intends to discuss with President Putin, but while we have been able to work effectively with the international community to isolate Russia -- and they are facing more isolation than they have in recent years -- we also acknowledge that the United States benefits from our allies, like Japan, having good relations with other countries around the world. So, presumably, that will be what Prime Minister Abe is pursuing when he meets with President Putin later this week.\nQ: Are you concerned that the meeting may send the wrong message that the G7 is not united, and may put pressure on Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no doubt that Japan and the other members of the G7 remain firmly united about the need for Russia to observe the basic territorial integrity and sovereignty of the nation of Ukraine.\nThanks, everybody, we'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:43 P.M.

There's nothing, not a single thing, that's more important to the future of America than whether or not you and young people all across this country can achieve their dreams.\" –President Barack Obama\nIn February 2014 President Obama launched MBK, a call to action to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and ensure all young people can reach their full potential. In response to the President's call to action, new federal policy initiatives, grant programs, and guidance are being implemented to ensure that every child has a clear pathway to success from cradle to college and career. Nearly 250 communities in all 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and 19 tribal nations have accepted the MBK Community Challenge, executing their own robust plans to ensure that all young people can achieve their full potential. And, more than $1 billion in private sector and philanthropic grants, in-kind resources, and low-interest financing have been committed to advance the goals of MBK and scale solutions that work.\nToday at the White House, nearly 300 leaders from MBK Community Challenge cities, towns, counties and tribal nations, federal, state and local policy makers and business, foundation and nonprofit executives will gather for the final MBK National Summit. The Summit will provide an opportunity to celebrate the progress, impact and future of this groundbreaking initiative, while highlighting new investments and infrastructure that will sustain and scale the initiative for the long-term. The Summit is being co-hosted by the White House, the U.S. Department of Education, the MBK Alliance, Bloomberg Associates, and the Executives' Alliance for Boys and Men of Color.\nNew Federal Commitments in Support of MBK\n•      National Student Attendance, Engagement, and Success Center—Leveraging Early Warning Systems and MBK Success Mentors to Keep Kids on Track. In order to keep all of our students on track toward college and career success, ED launched the National Student Attendance, Engagement, and Success Center (NSAEC) to support nationwide implementation prevention strategies, cross-sector partnerships, and Early Warning Systems (EWS) to prevent and address chronic absenteeism. To promote cross-state and cross-sector sharing of best practices and innovative strategies to support the success of all students, the National Center will also build and host nationwide two communities of practice (CoP'S) to support schools, districts, and states to implement and sustain EWS; employ multi-sector prevention and intervention activities, including success mentors; improve student engagement and motivation; undertake comprehensive approaches to reducing and eliminating chronic absenteeism; and collaborate with peers at annual national convenings. One CoP will be focused on Early Warning Systems and will be open to SIG schools, and the other will be targeted at the 30 My Brother's Keeper (MBK) Success Mentors cities.\n•      Increasing Data Transparency to Understand and Develop Strategies to Improve Youth Outcomes. To encourage analyses of important life outcomes for all youth, including boys and young men of color, the My Brother's Keeper Task Force compiled relevant statistical indicators from a range of federal data sources and made them available for download. Today, several of these indicators are now available through a set of My Brother's Keeper APIs built by the U.S. Department of Education. APIs provide developer-friendly access to data. In this case, they allow third-party digital services to seamlessly incorporate My Brother's Keeper data in real-time. Specifically, ED's MBK APIs provide access to information on 18- to 24-year-olds by race/ethnicity and sex, including high school dropout rates; college enrollment and graduation rates; rates of disconnected youth (who are neither working nor in school); imprisonment rates; and labor force participation rates.\n•      New Federal Investments to Meet the Needs of Current and Former Foster Youth. The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE), in consultation with the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will invest $1.35 million of Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act funds to provide technical assistance to public housing authorities participating in HUD's Family Unification Plan and Family Self-Sufficiency Demonstration to connect emancipated foster youth and those exiting the foster care system with high quality Career and Technical Education programs that strengthen academic, technical and employability skills. Through this investment, OCTAE hopes to assist existing career technical education programs to better meet the needs of current and former foster youth. Delivering on MBK Task Force recommendations, the project also seeks to improve coordination among the child welfare system and other federally-funded programs.\nRecent Federal Commitments in Support of MBK\n•      New Regulations and Supporting Documents to Address Racial and Ethnic Disparities in IDEA. Delivering on MBK Task Force recommendations, the U.S. Department of Education published final regulations under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that will address a number of issues related to significant disproportionality in the identification, placement, and discipline of students with disabilities based on race or ethnicity. The Department also released a new Dear Colleague Letter to remind states, school districts, and public schools of their legal obligation to prevent discrimination on the basis of race in special education.\n•      Supporting Reentry Pathways for Youth Transitioning from Juvenile Justice Facilities. The Department of Education released new guidance and technical assistance materials that will help State and local leaders provide transition assistance to youth reentering the community from juvenile justice facilities. These resources, which are available at www.ed.gov/jjreentry, can help local systems provide strong support for youth transitioning out of juvenile justice facilities, to ensure that they are able to successfully rejoin their communities, continue their education, and fulfill their potential.\n•      White House Report: The Continuing Need to Rethink Discipline. The White House released a new capstone report with updates about projects launched and local progress made in response to the Administration's Rethink Discipline efforts. Rethink Discipline was launched as part of MBK and aims to support all students and promote a welcome and safe climate in schools. The full report is available HERE. The White House also convened stakeholders and leaders to discuss the progress made and the work ahead to encourage and support local leaders as they work to implement supportive school discipline practices.\nNew Private Sector Commitments in Support of MBK\n•      Expanded Investment in MBK Community Challenge Acceptors in California. The California Endowment announced an additional commitment of $25 million over the next four years in support of healthier outcomes and improved well-being of boys and young men of color in California. This commitment builds on an earlier pledge by the foundation, bringing the total support to a projected $75 million over seven years from 2013 to 2020. These resources are supporting partnerships and other activities at the local level across the state of California, and are intended to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a meaningful pathway to health and opportunity for young men of color.\n•      Multiplying Commitment to Inspire and Recruit Mentors. In July of 2014, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) and the National Basketball Retired Players Association (NBRPA) announced a five-year commitment to support My Brother's Keeper. As part of this commitment, the NBA family partnered with MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership to support their \"In Real Life\" campaign and set a goal to recruit 25,000 new mentors over five years, with a focus on adult males of color. Less than three years into the partnership, already more than 25,000 Americans have signed up to become mentors and been connected directly to a mentoring program in their community. Going forward, the NBA family is renewing its commitment to mentoring by setting a new goal of increasing sign-ups by an additional 25,000 adult mentors. Find out more and get involved at www.mentoring.org\n•      Expanding Support for the MBK Community Challenge. In 2017, My Brother's Keeper Alliance will launch a wide array of investments available to the nearly 250 cities, towns, counties and tribal nations that accepted the My Brother's Keeper Community Challenge communities, including: a comprehensive online support platform that will house local and national data dashboards, interactive mapping and milestone components, a webinar and events portal, and a curated resource library; a suite of online trainings to build a community of learning and practice around topics such as data and impact, leadership development, collective action management, institutional implicit bias, program design and delivery, and mentoring strategies; and building off of the success of the White House's My Brother's Keeper National Summit, My Brother's Keeper Alliance will host a national summit to explore \"what works\" in communities across the country, provide in-depth technical assistance to clusters of practitioners, and elevate successes and challenges to inform a national agenda for boys and young men of color in 2017.\n•      New Data Dashboard Platforms to Support MBK Communities. In 2017, to help jurisdictions across the country better gather and share their equity data, Bloomberg Associates and PolicyLink will be working in partnership with MBKA to build an open platform for jurisdictions to produce their own MBK dashboards, merging administrative and social media data with national sources of information. The goal will be to provide clear guidance on how to pull data from agencies across city, county and state sources, and present it in a clear and unified way to allow local partners to know exactly how young men are faring in their jurisdictions, and to track progress. The platform will be free and accompanied by strong visualization tools, and the opportunity for comparative analysis across cities and states.", "timestamp": "2016-12-14", "title": "Fact Sheet: At National Summit White House Announces New Support of My Brother's Keeper"}

Hello, everybody! [Laughter] Hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Michelle and I want to be the first to wish all of you a happy Hanukkah. I figure we've got to be first, because we're about 10 days early. [Laughter]\nWe have some very special guests in the house to share some latkes with—[laughter]—so I want to call them out. We are, first of all, honored to be joined by Rabbi Steven Exler, the outstanding senior rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale. He also happens to be Secretary Jack Lew's rabbi. [Laughter] He taught my Director of Jewish Outreach, Chanan Weissman. So he obviously is doing something right. Also, let's give it up for Koleinu, whose sound might be the most beautiful thing to come out of Princeton since the woman standing next to me. So—[applause]. That was a good one, right?\nThe First Lady. That was a good one. [Laughter]\nThe President. Today, in the White House, as you will soon do in your homes, we recall Hanukkah's many lessons: How a small group can make a big difference. That's the story of the Maccabees' unlikely military victory and of great moral movements around the globe and across time. How a little bit can go a long way, like the small measure of oil that outlasted every expectation. It reminds us that even when our resources seem limited, our faith can help us make the most of what little we have. The small State of Israel and the relatively small Jewish population of this country have punched far above their weight in their contributions to the world. So the Festival of Lights is also a reminder of how Isaiah saw the Jewish people, as a light unto the nations.\nThis is the season that we appreciate the many miracles, large and small, that have graced our lives throughout generations and to recognize that the most meaningful among them is our freedom. The first chapter of the Hanukkah story was written 22 centuries ago, when rulers banned religious rituals and persecuted Jews who dared to observe their faith, which is why today we are asked not only to light the menorah, but to proudly display it: to publicize the mitzvah. And that's why we've invited all these reporters who are here. [Laughter]\nEverybody in America can understand the spirit of this tradition. Proudly practicing our religion, whatever it might be, and defending the rights of others to do the same—that's our common creed. That's what families from coast to coast confirm when they place their menorah in the window, not to share the candles' glow with just your family, but also with your community and with your neighbors.\nThe story of Hanukkah, the story of the Jewish people, the story of perseverance—these are one and the same. Elie Wiesel taught us that lesson probably better than just about anybody. In one of his memories of the Holocaust, Elie watched a fellow prisoner trade his daily ration of bread for some simple materials with which to piece together a makeshift menorah. And he wrote that he couldn't believe the sacrifices this man was making to observe the holidays. A stunned Elie asked him, \"Hanukkah in Auschwitz?\" And the man replied, \"Especially in Auschwitz.\"\nThe world lost my friend, Elie Wiesel, this year. We lost a keeper of our collective conscience. But we could not be more honored today to be joined by his beloved family. His wife Marion is here. [Applause] His wife Marion is here, beautiful as always. His son Elisha is here, his daughter-in-law Lynn, and his grandchildren Elijah and Shira. So today we're going to light a menorah that Shira made a few years ago when she was in kindergarten. [Laughter] And as is appropriate to the spirit of the season, it's made of simple materials. It's got bolts and tiles and glue. [Laughter] And it looks like some balsa wood.\nShira Wiesel. It's actually melted wax.\nThe President. What is it?\nShira Wiesel. It's actually melted wax.\nThe President. Melted wax. [Laughter] Just saying.\nOver the years, your grandfather also corrected me several times. [Laughter] And it was always very helpful. [Laughter]\nWe've lit a number of beautiful menorahs here at the White House. Some that weathered storms like Katrina and Sandy; others that were crafted by spectacular artists from Israel and the United States. But I've just got to say, this is my favorite. [Laughter] I think this is the most beautiful one that we've ever lit. [Laughter] And it's a reminder that a menorah is not valuable because it's forged in silver or gold. It's treasured because it was shaped by the hands of a young girl who proves with her presence that the Jewish people survive. Through centuries of exile and persecution and even the genocide of—families like the Wiesels endured, the Hanukkah candles have been kindled, each wick an answer to the wicked, each light a signal to the world that yours is an inextinguishable faith.\nJewish leaders from the Maccabees to the Wiesels, to the college students who proudly sing Hebrew songs on campus, reaffirm our belief that light still drives out darkness, and freedom still needs fighters.\nSo let me close by saying I want to say how much Michelle and I appreciate the opportunities to have celebrated so many Hanukkahs with you in the White House. You know, at the beginning of my Presidency, some critics thought it would last for only a year. [Laughter] But—miracle of miracles—it has lasted 8 years. [Applause] It's lasted 8 whole years. [Laughter] Nes gadol haya po.\nAudience members. We love you.\nAudience member. Got to go.\nThe President. Got to go! As many of you know, the name \"Hanukkah\" comes from the Hebrew word for \"dedication.\" So we want to thank you again for your dedication to our country, to the historic progress that we've made, to the defense of religious freedom in the United States and around the world.\nAnd with that, let me invite Rabbi Exler to say a few words before Elijah and Shira light the candles and get this party started. [Laughter]\nMr. Rabbi.\n[At this point, Rabbi Steven Exler, senior rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale in New York City, made brief remarks and led the audience in prayer and song.]\nThe President. Well, thank you, everybody.

In his remarks, he referred to Malachi Hernandez, student, Northeastern University in Boston, MA.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119914", "text": "Hello, everybody! Hello! Everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House.\nThank you, Malachi, for the great introduction and being a great role model for the young people coming up behind you. I was watching the introduction on the screen, he's very telegenic. [Laughter] I—we might have to run him for something at some point. [Laughter] We're so proud of you.\nAnd I want to make sure that we introduce the other young men who are behind me, as well, because they've got equally compelling stories: Devin Edwards, coming out of MBK Boston—Devin, wave; that's right, there you go—and as well as Bunker Hill Community College in Greater Boston; Jerron Hawkins, Howard University, White House Mentorship and Leadership Program; you already met Malachi; Noah McQueen, Morehouse College, one of our mentors; Luis Ramirez, MBK Oakland Career and Opportunity Fair; and Quamiir Trice, MBK Philadelphia, Howard University.\nThese young people behind me are proof that a little love, a little support allows them to achieve anything they can dream, anything they can conceive. Since day one, my administration has been focused on creating opportunities for all people. And by almost every measure, this country is better off than it was when I started. But what we've also long understood is that some communities have consistently had the odds stacked against them, and that's especially true for boys and young men of color.\nAll of you know the statistics and the stories of young people who had the intelligence, the potential to do amazing things, but somehow slipped through the cracks. And I've said this before: I see myself in these young people. I grew up without a father. There were times where I made poor choices, times where I was adrift. The only difference between me and a lot of other young men is that I grew up in a more forgiving environment. I had people who encouraged me and gave me a second chance.\nAnd that's why Michelle and I have dedicated so much of our time to creating opportunities for young people. We know this is not just an urban problem; it's not just a people-of-color problem. This is a national challenge, because if we're going to stay ahead as a nation, we're going to need the talent of every single American. And even more than that, this is about who we are as a country, what our values are, whether we're going to continue to be a place where if you work hard, you can succeed; or whether we continue to see stagnation and diminishing mobility and the ladders of opportunity cut off for too many people. The only way we live up to America's promise is if we value every single child, not just our own, and invest in every single child as if they're our own.\nIt's almost 3 years ago, we launched the \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative to give more of our young people the tools and the support that they need to stay on track for a bright future. We knew this couldn't just be a Government initiative. We knew that our concerns couldn't be sporadic, just inflamed by the latest high-profile shooting or some other disturbance. It had to be sustained, thought through. Progress had to be measurable.\nSo we put out a call for action across the country. And I've just got to say, the response was incredible. Hundreds of you—mayors, tribal leaders, county executives—have created MBK communities in all 50 States, as well as DC and Puerto Rico. Businesses and foundations, many of whom are represented here today, are working across sectors and investing more than a billion dollars in proven pathways for young people.\nIn just a few years, the progress we've made is remarkable. So I just wanted to come by and say thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you for stepping up to the challenge. Thank you for being great partners in this work. Thank you for believing in our young people.\nI also want to say thank you to the young men who are here and who came in from across the country and many of whom are watching or may be listening, who have been part of this initiative. I've had a chance to meet many of these young people. Everybody on this stage, I've had significant conversations with. I've heard their stories, and I've seen young men like this grow into confident, capable, responsible men. Many of you have overcome unbelievable obstacles, obstacles that most people never have to face. It hasn't always been easy, but look at the progress that you've inspired. I could not be prouder of these young people and so many who are participating around the country.\nAnd this is just the beginning. We are going to keep these efforts going to invest in our young people, to break down barriers to keep—that keep them from getting ahead, and to make sure that they've got a chance to contribute. And we're going to need more of you to be mentors and role models and supporters for this next generation. As they keep moving up in the world, then we're going to call on them to reach back and invest in the folks who are coming behind them.\nAnd that's the final point I want to make. \"My Brother's Keeper\" was not about me, it was not about my Presidency. It's not even just about Malachi and all these amazing young men behind me. It's about all of us working together. Because ensuring that our young people can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them is the single most important task that we have as a nation. It is the single most important thing we can do for our country's future. This is something I will be invested in for the rest of my life, and I look forward to continuing the journey with you.\nSo to the young people who are here, thank you. To folks who are investing and supporting this effort, thank you. But we are just scratching the surface.\nFor every one of these young men, there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands who are not currently being reached. And although it is important for us to poke and prod and push government at every level to make the investments that are necessary—to ensure our schools are properly funded and are teaching the kids what they need to learn, that we are investing and making sure that there are jobs available in communities so that people can see that there is a right path to go down that will result in them having a bright future; although there's infrastructure that has to be built by the government to ensure that our young people can succeed and prosper in this 21st-century economy—we can't wait for government to do it for us.\nWe've got to make sure that we're out there showing what works. We've got to put our own time and energy and effort and money into the effort. We have to be rigorous in measuring what works. We can't hang onto programs just because they've been around a long time. We can't be protective of programs that have not produced results for young people, even if they've produced some jobs for some folks running them. [Laughter] And we have to make sure that we're casting a wide net so that we're not just cherry-picking some kids who probably have so much drive, they'd make it anyway. We've also got to go deep, including into places like juvenile facilities and our prisons to make sure that some very still-young people are reachable.\nSo this is going to be a big project. It is as a consequence of neglect over generations that so many of these challenges exist. We shouldn't expect that we're going to solve these problems overnight, but we've got proof about what happens when, as Malachi said, you just give folks a little love and you act on that love. And I'm looking forward to working with you to do that.\nThank you, everybody. God bless. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-12-14", "title": "Remarks at the \"My Brother's Keeper\" National Summit"}

Since its ratification on December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights has enshrined many of our most fundamental liberties and unalienable rights—including the freedoms of speech, worship, and assembly; the rights to trial by jury and due process, and the protections from unreasonable search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment. For 225 years, the Bill of Rights has shaped our Nation and protected our citizens, and today, in honor of all those who have worked to secure these freedoms, we strive to continue forming a more perfect Union guided by an enduring belief in these highest ideals.\nAs it was originally created, the Bill of Rights safeguarded personal liberties and ensured equal justice under the law for many—but not for all. In the centuries that followed its ratification, courageous Americans agitated and sacrificed to extend these rights to more people, moving us closer to ensuring opportunity and equality are not limited by one's race, sex, or circumstances. The desire and capacity to forge our own destinies have propelled us forward at every turn in history. The same principles that drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny, a country to cast off the stains of slavery, women to reach for the ballot, and workers to organize for their rights still remind us that our freedom is intertwined with the freedom of others. If we are to ensure the sacred ideals embodied in the Bill of Rights are afforded to everyone, each generation must do what those who came before them have done and recommit to holding fast to our values and protecting these freedoms.\nTwo and a quarter centuries later, these 10 Constitutional Amendments remain a symbol of one of our Nation's first successful steps in our journey to uphold the rights of all citizens. On Bill of Rights Day, we celebrate the long arc of progress that transformed our Nation from a fledgling and fragile democracy to one in which civil rights are the birthright of all Americans. This progress was never inevitable, and as long as people remain willing to fight for justice, we can work to swing open more doors of opportunity and carry forward a vision of liberty and equality for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2016, as Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-14", "title": "Proclamation 9554—Bill of Rights Day, 2016"}

Hello, hello, hello! Hello. Good evening, everybody! Welcome to the White House, and happy Hanukkah! It so happens we're a little early this year. [Laughter]\nAudience member. It's all right. It's all right.\nThe President. But Michelle and I are going to be in Hawaii when Hanukkah begins, and we agreed that it's never too soon to enjoy some latkes and jelly donuts. [Laughter] This is our second Hanukkah party today, but in the spirit of the holiday, the White House kitchen has not run out of oil. [Laughter] Dad jokes for every occasion. [Laughter]\nI want to recognize some special guests that are with us today. There are a number of Members of Congress here who obviously are so supportive of the values that are represented by this holiday and extraordinarily strong friends of Israel. We've got Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg in the house. We've got one of the country's finest jurists, who I happened to have nominated to the Supreme Court and who's going to continue to serve our country with distinction as the Chief Judge on the DC Circuit, Merrick Garland is here. [Applause] Thanks you, Merrick.\nOur wonderful and outstanding and tireless Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, is here. As is our U.S. Trade Representative and former BBYO president, Mike Froman. And I want to give it up for our outstanding musical guests, Six13, who just did a amazing performance for Michelle and I of——\nThe First Lady. It was a \"Hamilton\" remix.\nThe President. ——a \"Hamilton\" remix talking about the Maccabees and the President and menorahs, and——\nThe First Lady. It was good.\nThe President. If you ever have a chance to get the mix tape, you should buy it. [Laughter]\nNow, this is the eighth year that Michelle and I have hosted this little gathering. And over the years, we've welcomed Jewish Supreme Court justices, Cabinet Secretaries, Members of Congress. We celebrated Alan Gross's return from captivity in Cuba. We got to celebrate a once-in-70,000-year event, Thanksgivukkah—[laughter]—where we lit the \"menurkey.\" [Laughter] That was a turkey-shaped menorah, in case you forgot. [Laughter]\nThe First Lady. We got it.\nThe President. So this is a White House tradition that we are proud to carry on. It gives us a lot of nachas. [Laughter] If I pronounced that right, then that was a Hanukkah miracle. [Laughter]\nTonight we come together for the final time to tell a familiar story, so familiar that even we Gentiles know it. [Laughter] But as many times as we tell it, this 2,000-year-old tale never gets old. In every generation, we take heart from the Maccabees' struggle against tyranny, their fight to live in peace and practice their religion in peace. We teach our children that even in our darkest moments, a stubborn flame of hope flickers and miracles are possible. Now, that spirit from two millennia ago inspired America's founders two centuries ago. They proclaimed a new nation where citizens could speak and assemble and worship as they wished. George Washington himself was said to have been stirred by the lights of Hanukkah after seeing a soldier seek the warmth of a menorah in the snows of Valley Forge. And years later, Washington wrote that timeless letter we have on display today in the White House. I hope you saw it when you walked in. Washington assured the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island, that the United States \"gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\" He went on to write that all that is required of those \"who live under [the Nation's] protection\" is that they be \"good citizens.\"\nIt's easy sometimes to take these fundamental freedoms for granted. But they too are miraculous. They too have to be nurtured and safeguarded. And it's in defense of these ideals—precisely because the Jewish people have known oppression—that throughout our history, this community has been at the forefront of every fight for freedom. It's why Jews marched in Selma, why they mobilized after Stonewall, why synagogues have opened their doors to refugees, why Jewish leaders have spoken out against all forms of hatred.\nAnd in my last months in office, I want to thank you for all your courage and your conviction and your outspokenness. The story of this community and the work you continue to do to repair the world forever reminds us to have faith that there are brighter days ahead. [Laughter]\nThe President. The menorah——\nThe First Lady. They're a little cynical. [Laughter]\nThe President. No, no, no, they're not cynical.\nThe First Lady. Little doubtful.\nThe President. The menorah we light today is a testament such resilient optimism. It belonged to Rina and Joseph Walden, a young Polish couple who acquired it in the early 1900s. When the Second World War came, the Waldens fled to France and took shelter on a farm. And they hid their Jewishness, including their magnificent menorah, entrusting it to a courageous neighbor. But one Hanukkah, they retrieved their menorah and lit it behind locked doors and covered windows. That same week, the Nazis raided their neighbor's house and burned it to the ground. Of all the Walden family's treasures, only this menorah survived.\nA few years later, the Waldens moved to Israel, where their son Raphael met a young woman named Tzvia Peres, the only daughter of one of Israel's founding fathers and greatest statesmen. And I had the honor to go to Jerusalem earlier this year to bid farewell to my dear friend Shimon Peres and reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the State of Israel. We could not be more honored to have Shimon's son Chemi, his grandson Guy, and his granddaughter Mika here with us tonight.\nThe Walden-Peres family lit these lights when the State of Israel was new. They've blazed it in the months after the Yom Kippur War and the Camp David Accords. And tonight Chemi and Mika will light this amazing heirloom in the White House. And as they do, we hope all of you draw strength from the divine spark in Shimon Peres, whose miraculous life taught us that \"faith and moral vision can triumph over all adversity.\" I hope it inspires us to rededicate ourselves to upholding the freedoms we hold dear at home and around the world; that we are able to see those who are not like us and recognize their dignity, not just those who are similar to us. I hope it inspires us to continue to work for peace, even when it is hard, perhaps especially when it is hard.\nAnd as Washington wrote to the Jews of Newport more than 200 years ago, \"May the father of all mercies scatter light, and not darkness, in our paths.\"\nI'd now like to invite Rabbi Rachel Isaacs from Colby College and Temple Beth Israel in Waterville, Maine—which I said sounds cold—[laughter]—to say a few words and lead us in blessings. But first, I have to get a box, because she's a little shorter than I am. [Laughter]\n[At this point, Rabbi Rachel M. Isaacs, associate professor of Jewish studies at Colby College, made brief remarks, offered a prayer, and led the audience in song.]\nThe President. Well, we hope that you enjoy this celebration here at the White House. On behalf of Michelle and myself, we could not be more grateful for your friendship and your prayers. And we want to emphasize that although we will be leaving here on January 20——\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. ——we will meet you on the other side. [Laughter] And we've still got a lot of work to do. We look forward to doing that work with you, because it's not something that we can do alone, and you've always been such an extraordinary group of friends that strengthen us in so many different ways.\nI should also note that your singing was outstanding. [Laughter] I think this was an exceptional group of voices here. [Laughter]\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-12-14", "title": "Remarks at a Hanukkah Reception"}

Trump today announced his intent to appoint U.S. Congressman Ryan Zinke from Montana as Secretary of the Interior.\nRep. Zinke has spent his time in the U.S. House of Representatives building an impressive portfolio on Interior issues ranging from federal mineral leases to tribal affairs to public lands conservation. Rep. Zinke is widely praised for his voting record that supports the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy of managing public lands, which calls for multiple-use to include economic, recreation and conservation.\n\"I am pleased to nominate Congressman Ryan Zinke as our Secretary of the Interior. He has built one of the strongest track records on championing regulatory relief, forest management, responsible energy development and public land issues,\" said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \"As a former Navy SEAL, he has incredible leadership skills and an attitude of doing whatever it takes to win. America is the most beautiful country in the world and he is going to help keep it that way with smart management of our federal lands. At the same time, my administration's goal is to repeal bad regulations and use our natural resources to create jobs and wealth for the American people, and Ryan will explore every possibility for how we can safely and responsibly do that.\"\n\"As someone who grew up in a logging and rail town and hiking in Glacier National Park, I am honored and humbled to be asked to serve Montana and America as Secretary of Interior,\" said Rep. Zinke. \"As inscribed in the stone archway of Yellowstone National Park in Gardiner, Montana, I shall faithfully uphold Teddy Roosevelt's belief that our treasured public lands are 'for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.' I will work tirelessly to ensure our public lands are managed and preserved in a way that benefits everyone for generations to come. Most important, our sovereign Indian Nations and territories must have the respect and freedom they deserve. I look forward to making the Department of Interior and America great again. May God bless Montana, God bless America and God bless the troops who defend her.\"\nAs a fifth-generation Montanan who grew up near Glacier National Park, Rep. Zinke has had a lifelong appreciation for preserving America's natural beauty. He has consistently led the efforts to renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund in Congress, and has also been a firm advocate for our nation's sportsmen to gain access to our public lands with the SCORE Act and SHARE Act. Rep. Zinke also introduced the Resilient Federal Forest Act in Congress, which initiated new reforms for revitalizing America's timber areas and preventing wildfires.\nRep. Zinke holds a Geology degree from the University of Oregon, where he was an All-PAC 10 football player, a Master's in Business Finance from National University, and a Master's in Global Leadership from the University of San Diego.\nZinke served for 23 years as a U.S. Navy SEAL, retiring in 2008 with a rank of Commander after leading SEAL operations throughout the globe. After serving in the Montana State Senate, Zinke became the first Navy SEAL to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives when he was elected in 2014. In Congress he has served on the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Natural Resources. Rep. Zinke is an adopted member of the Assiniboine Sioux Tribe at the Fort Peck Reservation in Northeast Montana. Rep. Zinke is married to his wife Lolita and they have three children.", "timestamp": "2016-12-15", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

He went above and beyond the call of duty as a Navy SEAL for more than two decades. After hanging up the uniform, he decided to continue his service by representing the people of Montana in the House. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, he has been an ardent supporter of all-of-the-above energy policies and responsible land management. And as a Westerner with close to one third of his state owned by the federal government, he is intimately familiar with how Washington's decisions affect people's lives. Ryan's experience and commitment to improving the lives of all Americans will make him an excellent Interior Secretary. I could not be happier for Ryan, Lola, and their entire family.\"\nU.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-MT):\n\"Ryan Zinke protected us abroad and in combat and I know he will do the same for our treasured public lands as Secretary of the Interior,\" Daines stated. \"In Congress, I've seen Ryan stand up and fight to protect our way of life. As a westerner, Ryan understands the challenges of having the federal government as your largest neighbor and I couldn't think of a better fit for Secretary of the Interior.\"\nHouse Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (R-UT):\n\"Selfishly, I'm not crazy about this nomination, because Zinke was a bright freshman member of our committee. This will be a loss for us. I was looking forward to working with him on Resources and in the Western Caucus. However, this appointment gives us greater opportunity to help people and solve problems that face the West.\n\"In our committee, he dealt with many issues including transmission rights-of-way to move power from its production source to where the people are. He experienced firsthand the frustrations associated with an administration that didn't put its priorities on helping people and effective land management.\n\"He also understands our frustrations with Interior's arbitrary rules and regulations that put dogma ahead of helping people. He clearly understands Speaker Ryan's Article I initiative. I am excited to have an administration that will now partner with Congress to solve problems created by years of mismanagement at Interior. I look forward to working with Zinke to create new solutions.\"\nRep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC):\n\"The selection of Congressman Ryan Zinke to head up the Department of the Interior is another great addition by the President-Elect to an already excellent cabinet. I am very excited about the pick and I hope that he accepts. This Navy SEAL has been a pleasure to work with over the last Congress. I had the chance to serve with Ryan on the Committee on Natural Resources, which oversees the Department. He showed a depth of knowledge concerning interior issues that will provide an experienced voice in President Trump's White House. Whether that be ensuring that the American public has access to federal lands or that we are developing the energy resources in federal areas, Ryan is someone who is on the right side of these important issues. Ryan and I also share the similar passions for the outdoors and sportsmen's issues. As Co-Chairman of the largest Caucus in Congress - the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus (CSC) - I look forward to working with a fellow outdoorsman on issues important to the hunters, fishermen, shooters and outdoor loving Americans. Initiatives of the CSC like the SHARE Act will be a top priority in the next Congress. I believe Ryan will be ready to help deliver real results to these efforts as well as many others while Secretary of the Interior.\"\nDale Hall, CEO of Ducks Unlimited:\n\"We are pleased to see a hunter and conservationist nominated to the top public lands position and look forward to working with Rep. Zinke on issues of critical importance to conservation.\"\nRob Sisson, President of ConservAmerica:\n\"ConservAmerica congratulates Rep. Ryan Zinke on his nomination to be the next Secretary of the Interior. Based on conversations I've had with Rep. Zinke on a number of issues, I am confident President Elect Trump made an inspired choice. Mr. Trump's comments last week in North Carolina about public lands and the party's Theodore Roosevelt conservation legacy foreshadowed this caliber of nominee.\"\nPaul Walker, Executive Director of ConservAmerica:\n\"His Montana background will serve him well in this role. About one-third of Montana's land mass is public, providing Rep. Zinke a firm grounding in the challenges inherent in the stewardship of public lands and local economies. His current constituency includes ranchers, farmers, loggers, hunters, anglers, Native Americans, miners, and high-tech innovators. In order to pass our great public lands legacy on to future generations, we need those groups to work more closely as stakeholders with appropriate government agencies. Rep. Zinke is a leader who can bring them together.\"\nTina Beattie, Chair of the ConservAmerica Board:\n\"We stand ready to partner with the new Secretary of Interior as our nation seeks to continue its record of good stewardship of our land, water, and wildlife. We're excited to see him bring his Navy SEAL ethic to the Department of the Interior.\"\nLand Tawney, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers (BHA) President and CEO:\n\"Congressman Zinke understands the importance of public lands and balancing management of these important resources with energy development and other uses. As Montana's lone representative in the House of Representatives, Mr. Zinke has showed himself to be receptive to the interests of a wide range of constituents and a potential ally of sportsmen and other outdoor recreationists.\n\"Charged with administering significant federal lands and natural resources, the Interior secretary is possibly the most powerful individual in the country when it comes to the future of our cherished public lands and waters, fish and wildlife and outdoor traditions.\n\"We're gratified that the Trump administration is listening to our concerns and showing a willingness to act in the best interests of the American people and our irreplaceable public lands legacy.\"\nBHA National Board Chair Ryan Busse:\n\"Montana sportsmen have welcomed opportunities to engage with Representative Zinke during his work on behalf of Montanans as a member of Congress. We appreciate his efforts to keep public lands public and to strongly fund cornerstone natural resources programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund; at the same time, we are committed to ensuring that fish and wildlife and their habitats are considered priorities with competing uses of our public lands.

The Interior Secretary is our nation's strongest advocate for protecting and actively harnessing more than 500 million acres of federal land and natural resources for the benefit of all Americans. Nobody values the importance of public land use better than a Westerner. As a conservationist hailing from the energy-producing state of Montana, Congressman Zinke understands the critical role that the Interior Department plays in balancing the effective management of our nation's lands and waters with multiple use policies that open access to the public for conservation, recreational opportunities, job-creating economic activities, and safe, responsible energy development.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119851", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:47 A.M. EDT\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Good afternoon, everyone -- or morning -- as it is. So before I turn this over to our esteemed CEA Chairman, Jason Furman, to talk about our eighth annual and final Economic Report of the President, I thought I'd take a couple minutes and just provide some context. And so Jason and I will talk through the report a little bit and take a few of your questions. And then we will turn it over to Josh to continue with our regularly scheduled programming.\nSo as we've discussed many times in this room, the incoming President campaigned on a very different approach than President Obama, so we don't need to rehash all of that here. But one way to think about this final Economic Report is as a comprehensive scoreboard of the economic progress over the past eight years. And so this breezy, 594-page report -- (laughter) -- that the Chairman is holding is based on facts and data, and it tells the story of the significant progress that we've seen and that can and should be used as a benchmark for future administrations.\nSo Jason will go into all this in greater detail, with some slides to follow, but a quick primer for all of you on how far we've come.\nFirst, when the President took office, as you know, we were losing nearly 800,000 jobs per month. Now we've added an average of nearly 200,000 jobs per month for more than six years, which is the longest streak of total job growth on record.\nYou'll recall that in 2012 we had presidential candidates making campaign promises to get the unemployment rate below 6 percent by 2016. Today we've far surpassed that, with the unemployment rate cut by more than half to 4.6 percent. And meanwhile, middle-class incomes rose at the fastest rate on record last year, up $2,800 for the typical household. The number of people in poverty fell by 3.5 million. That's the largest one-year drop in the poverty rate since the 1960s. And all the while the S&P 500 has tripled since the lows reached in March of 2009.\nSo you've all heard about the President's approach to our economy,between growing from the middle out, building an economy that works for everyone. You know that this has meant restoring higher tax rates on the wealthy so they pay more of their fair share. It's meant a relentless focus on creating good jobs and raising wages. It's meant taking concrete steps to make college more affordable for every college student and their families. And it's meant a new cop on the beat in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, fighting to protect consumers from abuse and putting nearly $12 billion back in consumers' pockets.\nAnd so this report shows that that approach is working. Now, I'll remind you there are number of policies that the President proposed that would have done even more, and while, historically, a number of these policies have enjoyed broad bipartisan support, in this Republican-led Congress they will instead go down in history as missed opportunities.\nTake, for example, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers, which would directly reduce hardship for more than 13 million low-income workers struggling to make ends meet. Passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have boosted incomes by $131 billion, not to mention cementing America's leadership in the Asia Pacific. Raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour would have boosted wages for nearly 35 million workers, more than one in four working Americans, according to an analysis of the Economic Policy Institute.\nThere are many more, but you get the point. And so the final piece and context that I would urge you to consider, both today as you listen to this presentation, and going forward as you evaluate the next President, is that much of this progress is the result of the tough choices this President made early on, and he put this country ahead of politics and he faced serious political headwinds.\nSo take, for example, the auto industry rescue. Clearly there was a lot of opposition to that at the time, and it ended up saving more than 1 million jobs. And now the auto industry has added nearly 700,000 new jobs since 2009. Domestic auto production has hit record highs.\nHe took swift action to stabilize our financial system while securing more than $1.4 trillion in support for our economy at a time when many were trying to turn stimulus into a dirty word.\nSo how did these decisions play out? Republicans said the ACA and Wall Street reform would kills jobs. But instead we've seen the longest streak of total job growth on record. They said the President's climate and clean energy policies would drive up gas prices. And instead we've seen low gas prices driven in part by increased domestic energy production. They said raising taxes on the wealthy would crush our economy. And instead the stock market is surging, profits are up, and incomes are rising across the board.\nSo this time, eight years ago, when the President took office, he was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And we weren't talking about record streaks of job growth or the fastest income growth on record; we were teetering on the edge of abyss. Now, that is a seriously far cry from the highly beneficial financial system and situation that this President-elect is inheriting.\nSo, at some point a few years from now, you'll be seeing some new faces at this podium who will outline for you all of what the Trump administration's economic strategy has been and the approach that they have taken. You'll have an opportunity to evaluate the impact of their policies and rely on the same economic data and metrics that you see now to judge how their approach has worked. And as you sit here in the future, in the seats that you assign yourselves -- (laughter) -- we urge you draw your conclusions based on data and facts, like the one in this year's Economic Report.\nSo with that long windup, I will turn it over to the Chairman to arm you with all the data to sound smart at your holiday parties and to evaluate the next administration.\nSo, over to the Chairman.\nMR. FURMAN: Thank you, Jen. Thanks all for coming here. We're very proud of the 71st Economic Report of the President, the eighth in this administration, and -- I apologize to all of you -- the longest one ever. But it took 594 pages to document both what's happened in the last eight years, but also to try to understand the direct role that the President's policies have played in what's happened.\nI understood there were going to be slides, but if somebody can advance them for me and go to the first slide. It gets to what Jen said, and this is a point we've made many times before\n-- that I remember sitting in the transition office eight years ago when we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. At the time, the estimates actually underestimated what we subsequently learned to be 800,000 jobs per month. And then we've seen since then a record streak of job creation with more than 15.5 million jobs created.\nAnd it's all too easy to, in retrospect, see that as something inevitable and natural that just happened, but it was anything but. As the next slide shows you, the shock that precipitated this job loss was much more severe than the shock that led to the Great Depression. In the Great Depression, 2 percent of wealth was lost as a result of the crash in the stock market and the fall in home prices. In this crisis, it was precipitated by an 18 percent loss of wealth because home ownership was much more widespread and house prices fell even more.\nEconomists have studied financial crises around the world, and they usually end up looking more like the Great Depression, with a prolonged decade of extremely high unemployment, of output not returning to its trend. And, indeed, that's what we saw in the wake of this financial crisis in Europe and other countries around the world that still have not gotten back to where they were before the crisis.\nThe United States has done much better than that historical benchmark, better than other countries around the world. And that's because of a range of policies -- one of which I would highlight on the next slide, which is, within a month of taking office, on February 17, 2009, the President signed into law the Recovery Act. That was the single-largest fiscal measure as a share of GDP ever done. It was larger than any single fiscal measure to respond to the Great Depression.\nBut what a lot of people realize is we didn't finish there. After that, we did 12 subsequent pieces of fiscal legislation, including payroll tax cut, unemployment insurance, support for homeowners, investments infrastructure that together added up to those orange bands, which, along with the automatic stabilizers, was a larger fiscal response and a faster fiscal response than you saw in any of the other major economies in the world. That complemented the monetary policy response. The financial rescue, which, as Jen said, was not popular at the time, but we've gotten every dollar back and more that we put into the banks, and saved the financial system. And then the auto rescue that prevented the loss, potentially, of a million manufacturing jobs not just in the auto industry, but the suppliers and associated.\nThe result of this, you see on the next slide, is that the unemployment rate has consistently fallen. It's fallen at or faster than the rate that you've ever seen in any OECD country in the wake of a run-up of the unemployment rate of this nature. It's consistently outpaced forecasts. You see the forecast there that was made in the 2010 that thought we'd never get to a 5 percent unemployment rate, and we're now at 4.6 percent.\nThis decline in the unemployment rate, as you see in the next slide, has followed the progression that you expect to see in the economy, which is, first, we got GDP growth in 2009, employment growth starting in 2010, and then, starting at about 2013, wage growth really picked up. And it has grown at an 18 percent faster annual rate since 2012 than it did in the entire time from 1980 through 2007.\nAnd if you look at the next slide, you can see that for this business cycle as a whole, if you look as an economist would like to, from the peak of the business cycle to the present, or peak to peak for the past, wage growth has been faster than any business cycle on record. Moreover, as we see in the next slide, is wage growth has been broadly enjoyed with very strong gains for the typical household. As Jen said, that's the fastest gain ever recorded. And then even stronger gains for households at the bottom of the income distribution.\nAs I said, a range of policies have contributed to this. It didn't automatically happen. One of those policies is what you see on this next slide, which is that when the President called for a higher minimum wage in his State of the Union address at the beginning of 2013, it was part of a very deliberate strategy that he wanted Congress to raise the minimum wage, but also wanted states, cities, businesses to do it. And if you look at that blue bar, that shows you the average value of the state and federal minimum, which has actually gone up, because 18 states and the District of Columbia and more than 50 municipalities have followed the President's call. Unfortunately, the federal one has continued to be eroded by inflation. And you could get that much more wage growth if that was raised.\nAnother policy that has been important and will be even more important in the coming years and decades is shown on the next slide, which is the large increase in investments in college education, which we document in one of the chapters of our report.\nIn addition, as you see in the next slide, we have an entire chapter on inequality, and it documents the combination of the Affordable Care Act, cutting taxes for low-income families, especially low-income families with children, and raising taxes on those most able to afford it have resulted in a historic reduction in after-tax income inequality, the largest under any President on record, with data going back to 1960, and the largest investments in tackling inequality since the Great Society. And as you saw, that's paying dividends.\nFinally, the report includes an extensive analysis of the Affordable Care Act. As you see in the next slide -- and lots of people are familiar with the percentage of people without health insurance has gone done dramatically to below 10 percent for the first time on record. But as the slide after this shows, this has really meant something to everyone, not just the people who didn't have insurance. People who had insurance get a range of protections like free prevention, coverage from preexisting conditions, and no lifetime and annual limits. I've also seen a dramatic slowdown in premium growth, and if you count out-of-pocket costs, the slowdown has been even larger.\nIf you go to the last slide, I would conclude by saying that none of this was an accident. You can draw a direct line between policies in areas that we haven't had a chance to talk about here, like financial reform, climate change, macroeconomic policy, health care, education -- between not just the outcomes that we have seen to date but also putting the economy in a better position to have a more stable financial system, slower health cost growth, more competitive economy overall going forward.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Great, thank you, Jason. So we have time to take a few questions on this document here and then we'll turn it over to Josh.\nJustin.\nQ: I have two things. The press was -- Janet Yellen said yesterday that you don't need a big job program or tax cuts right now, with the labor market near full employment, and that additional debt spending could be an even bigger risk to the economy. I'm wondering if you agree with that, and if you would encourage President-elect Trump, therefore, to steer away from some of the policies that you guys have advocated over the last eight years. I'm also wondering, given where we are at the late stage of this business cycle, what you see the chances for a recession in the next four years is.\nMR. FURMAN: So in answer to your first question, the economy I think is almost all the way healed from the Great Recession. These have really lasting consequences. Most of the other countries affected by the global financial crisis are not healed to the degree that we are. But our unemployment rate is back to where it was before the crisis; a lot of the other measures are. I think there's probably still some additional slack in terms of people working part-time, and in participation, but not a lot.\nWhat I think our economy needs is more things that will increase our productivity over the medium and long-run and expand the potential of our economy. So we have, as Jen noted in her introduction, proposed substantial infrastructure spending. And last year, Congress did a down payment on that -- they did a five-year infrastructure bill that was a 5 percent increase in inflation-adjusted terms. That was welcome and that's helping. That's something we should do more of going forward.\nBut it's important when you do it, one, to make sure you're getting actual net new infrastructure out of it, and two, that you're not doing it at the expense of your medium and long-run deficit. So the President also explained exactly how he'd pay for that increase in infrastructure.\nSo a policy like that, just in economics parlance, is something that we think of a little bit less on the demand side because we're most of the way recovered, but something that would help us expand aggregate supply over time.\nIn terms of your second question, economists have studied this question, and the way they like to put it is that business cycles don't die of old age -- which if you're a person who's older, you have a higher probability of mortality in that year than a person who's younger. That's not true of the economy and business cycles. If you look at where we are right now, 70 percent of our economy is consumer spending. The real wage increases I showed you, the confidence that consumers have, the fact that they're deleveraged means that we have a lot more potential in our economy going forward. That, of course, does require continuing to have sensible and sound policies that have undergirded that economic strength.\nQ: Let me ask you about inflation. The Fed raised interest rates yesterday. They're proposing to raise it several times next year. They seem to be looking over the horizon and seeing inflation. Do you see inflation out there?\nMR. FURMAN: We have our final forecast in the Economic Report, so you can look up what we forecast inflation to be. It was pretty similar to what the blue chip, which is gradually rising to what the Fed has said its target is, which is 2 percent for inflation as measured by the PCE.\nBut all the signs we have seen is almost exactly what you'd want to see, which is a process that's been very gradual and consistent with the goals that policymakers have set out, again, unlike some other parts of the world, which are still worried even about deflation. That's a conversation we haven't had in the United States, and we haven't had for good reason, because of the economic policies we've had.\nQ: A totally hypothetical -- if the new administration were to come in with bigger deficits, more deficit spending, borrowing, et cetera, is that more of a concern?\nMR. FURMAN: I think we have made progress on the deficit. We've cut it from 10 percent to GDP to about 3 percent of GDP. If you look over the medium and long run, it starts to creep back up again, which is why we've put out a budget that shows what you would do to continue to lower the deficit over the medium and long term, keep it on the path that we've already been on. And I think it would be unwise to do something other than that. The economy needs additional investments to help it grow, but those shouldn't be coming at the expense of a large and costly reversing of the progress we've made on getting the deficit down.\nQ: One of the biggest criticisms of Obamacare that's used is the cost, and yet you said that you're now seeing the lowest growth in premiums versus pre-Obamacare. Could you go into that more? And why is that message not more successful?\nMR. FURMAN: I think once people have read the chapter in here on health care, which is 105 pages, they'll all fully appreciate this set of points.\nQ: Nighttime reading.\nMR. FURMAN: All night long. (Laughter.) Pull an all-nighter and read it. But just to give you the facts, if you look at health care prices, since the Affordable Care Act they've grown at the slowest pace health care prices have grown in over 50 years. If you look at health care costs per enrollee, they have slowed dramatically in private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid.\nIf you look at insurance premiums, they've also slowed and are among the lowest growth we've ever seen there. And if you include out-of-pocket costs, it is the case that deductibles have gone up -- they were going up before the Affordable Care Act -- that's continued to happen, but people also now get free prevention and get health insurance plans that have out-of-pocket limits, which they didn't use to have. So you take all that into account, and out-of-pocket payments have actually -- the growth of those has slowed as well.\nI think it's certainly the case that the health system is not perfect. People remain dissatisfied with all sorts of aspects of it. And that is completely understandable, and that's why there's a lot more work that remains to be done. But the health system is in much better shape in terms of both cost growth and all the measures we have of quality as well -- for example, hospital-acquired infections or readmissions have also come way down. And you can draw -- and we do here -- a direct line between some of the reforms we've made in Medicare and some of the ways the private sector has mimicked and adopted those reforms to really improve the health system.\nBut, of course, people want it to continue to be better, and that's why a lot more work remains to be done.\nQ: I wanted to ask about productivity and what -- to kind of get an idea of your theory of why it's slowed, and how big of a problem you think it is for the next administration, what it might mean for living standards going forward.\nMR. FURMAN: So I think you're asking exactly the right question, and like every question, somewhere in this 594 pages is the answer.\nOn productivity, the first thing to understand is it's been a global phenomenon. You've seen productivity growth slow everywhere. In fact, if you look at the G7 economies, the United States has had the fastest productivity growth of all of the G7 economies. And that's in part because a lot of the tremendous innovation that we've seen here -- whether it's in the tech industry, mobile, computing, artificial intelligence, personalized medicines, advanced materials, or all the other things, some of which may continue to be adding to in possibly a bigger way productivity growth in the future.\nThe problem that a lot of the advanced economies have seen is a slowdown of capital accumulation. A lot of that appears to be a fallout from the very deep recession, and something that you would expect to see in the wake of something like that. And as capital investment rebounds -- which historically it has after periods like this -- you'd expect to see some strengthening. That being said, if you look at the underlying trends in the economy that require more work, certainly productivity is part of that, and that's why we've done so much to put forward infrastructure, investments in science, expanding international trade as a way to raise productivity through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the like.\nQ: Thanks. I just wanted to get you to describe growth as a percentage of GDP. Would you call it robust? Would you call it something less than that? And are you satisfied with the rate of growth, especially given the extensive jobs growth that we've seen over the last eight years, and yet, as a percentage of GDP, I wouldn't say it's exactly overwhelming. How would you describe it?\nMR. FURMAN: The United States has outpaced what you would expect after just a massive financial crisis of the type we went through just eight years ago -- outpaced some of the historical benchmarks, outpaced other countries around the world. And, in particular, if you look where it matters most to people, which is the job market, the unemployment rate being 4.6 percent, more than 15 million jobs added, wages growing at the fastest pace they have of any expansion since the 1970s and growing even faster for people at the middle and the bottom than for those at the top, this is an economy that really is generating gains for American families.\nOf course, a lot more work remains to be done. Of course, we should be raising the minimum wage, making investments to raise productivity growth to do even better, but you'd be building on what I would describe as a very solid foundation.\nQ: To push back just a bit. As far as some communities doing better than others, in particular, wage growth among college graduates has certainly been on the rise -- we can go back to the 1970s -- but for those who are not college graduates, for those who have two-year degrees and less, frankly, their wages have been relatively stagnant. I think you would at least acknowledge that, would you not? And I guess the other part of this is, given all the great reporting that we just heard today and have heard consistently from Josh and others, the American people sort of didn't feel that way back on November 8th. Is there this disconnect because they're not seeing it? Is it because you're not explaining it properly? Tell me where that is not syncing up based on what you just showed.\nMR. FURMAN: That was a lot of different questions in one. I mean, I'd, first of all, say, no, I actually don't agree with your statement about wage stagnation. If your statement is for many, many decades there was wage stagnation -- absolutely. If you looked at that previous chart, from 1980 through 2007, wages grew at .1 of a percent per year for 27 years. If you look at the last couple years, they've grown at nearly a percent and a half per year. So you're growing at a much faster rate.\nNow, that's not enough to make up for 27 sub-par years in a row -- or 27 sub-par years, on average. So there's a lot more work to dig out of a hole that was many decades in the making. But I think it's indisputable that we're moving very much in the right direction and that you're seeing larger income gains for households at the tenth percentile or the 50th percentile than you are for households at the 90th percentile.\nSo, again, that hasn't made up for several decades of problems, but it's been a quite remarkable reversal -- the fastest income gains for the typical household ever recorded.\nIn terms of people feeling it, the data I look at on that is, are consumers confident? Yes. Are consumers spending money? That's one of the strongest parts of our economy. People are essentially voting when they go into a store or when they decide whether to buy a house, and they're voting yes and voting their confidence in the economy.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Again, thank you and for this final report.\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Before we get started, obviously I appreciate Jason and Jen offering up the presentation. Today is a -- as you get towards the end of the administration, you have to start acknowledging some departures. And today is a special day in the briefing room, not just because it was Jen's first time behind the podium, but it also is likely the last time that she'll be attending a White House briefing in person -- at least with this administration. She'll be leaving the administration at the end of the year.\nJen, over the course of her service to this President, has taken on a variety of difficult assignments -- and I don't just mean being my deputy. She's also served at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Treasury. She took on assignments at each of those agencies that they couldn't find anybody else to do because they didn't have confidence in anybody else's ability to handle it. And so they brought on Jen to take on those challenges. And in each case, and in each situation, she performed even better than people assumed that she would.\nSo to borrow some of the economic parlance that we've been hearing, I am certainly bullish about the prospects for Jen's career when she leaves the White House. But we all owe her a deep debt of gratitude for her performance and service to the country and to the administration. And as somebody who spent five years serving as a deputy White House press Secretary, I can't think of anybody who has been more effective and taken on more responsibility in this role than Jen has.\nSo, Jen, thank you. And we wish you well as you pursue other things. (Applause.)\nWith that out of the way, Kathleen, do you want to kick us off here?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. And thanks to Jen for all your hard work.\nI want to just start with the latest reports on the Russia hacking story. Has the White House been told that Vladimir Putin was personally involved in Russia's attempts to interfere with the election?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not have an additional intelligence assessment to share from the podium. As we've seen in the last several days, there are officials in the intelligence community who apparently are calling all of you to anonymously share their thoughts and conclusions and opinions.\nI think what is relevant to this point is to consider the statement that was made back on October 7th. This was the statement that was issued by the intelligence community. It reflected the unanimous opinion and conclusion of all 17 intelligence agencies. And they reported publicly that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity to erode public confidence in our democracy. They included another sentence that I believe is worth repeating, so let me just read it here. That statement included in part: \"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\" That is the statement from the intelligence community that was made public on October 7th.\nAt the risk of editorializing, when I read that statement for the first time in early October, I didn't think it was particularly subtle.\nQ: You didn't think it was --\nMR. EARNEST: It was particularly subtle.\nQ: Oh. So are you confirming that the White House believes that Vladimir Putin was --\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports. I'm not in a position to confirm them. I'd refer you to the intelligence community for their assessment. But their assessment that they reported publicly on October 7th may give you some insight into what they may be thinking.\nQ: And since you mentioned some of the officials being willing to talk to the media, are you worried about leaks on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, one of the challenges of any White House Press Secretary, regardless of which administration they're serving in, is that they have a responsibility of coming out here in public and answering questions from all of you, on camera and on the record. Others are allowed to offer their opinion anonymously. It's a free country, and that's certainly what people are, to some extent, allowed to do.\nIn the past, you've heard me express some concern about that habit. It's particularly concerning in those circumstances when people are sharing information that's classified or sensitive. But this is not a new phenomenon. It's one that previous press secretaries have held to deal with. It's certainly something that's come up in the context of my tenure, and I suspect that future White House press secretaries will encounter the same thing.\nQ: And then on a different topic. We're hearing a little bit about how Donald Trump might -- and his daughter Ivanka -- might have something of a different arrangement in the White House, that she may move into the East Wing and be something approaching the -- take on some of the First Lady's role and also an advisory role. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the President and First Lady drew that line and sort of talk about how they arranged their sort of conversations on policy.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, Presidents throughout our history have, in part based on the structure of their family, put together a system that works for them and works for the country. Obviously, when Secretary Clinton, for example, was First Lady, she had a hands-on role in some policymaking efforts here at the White House. Other First Ladies, including Mrs. Obama, have refrained from engaging at that level on a lot of policymaking.\nBut what we have seen from Mrs. Obama is an effort to focus on some priority areas that are near and dear to her heart. And that includes offering support to military families, giving more girls in the United States and around the world access to quality educational opportunities, and, of course, encouraging Americans of all ages to have a healthy and active lifestyle.\nShe has pursued those initiatives because of her interest in them, personally. She's also pursued the progress on those issues, because she believes that each of them is important to the country. And Mrs. Obama has certainly established quite a legacy for the effective and strategic and impactful use of the attention and limelight that comes with serving as First Lady, and she has directed that to a lot of good use. And I certainly wish the Trump family well as they figure out the best way to design a system where they can do the same.\nRoberta.\nQ: What kind of government information was compromised, if any, in the Yahoo! hack? How concerned is the White House about the very large hack? And how likely are we to see attribution provided by the government about who's responsible for that hack?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak from here to the potential scope of material that could be vulnerable or may have been exfiltrated. What I can say is that the FBI is investigating this matter. There was a previously reported breach that the FBI had previously indicated that they were investigating, and they're investigating this situation, as well. So I'll let them speak to what they have found over the course of that investigation thus far.\nWhen it comes to attribution, the principle that our investigators and the President's national security team have applied is to ensure that it wouldn't undermine the investigation to go public with some information about what we have learned about the investigation. So, for example, we would want to be sure that before we indicate publicly who we believe or who the intelligence community has concluded is responsible for the breach we would want to make sure that revealing that information didn't undermine the ability the investigators to learn more about what had happened.\nSo that will be the chief criteria that will be used in determining how and whether the FBI should make public who they have concluded is responsible for this particular breach. And that includes whether it's a state actor, a criminal organization, or some other entity.\nQ: Switching topics, there have been some questions about the deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system. Given the impeachment vote in South Korea and, of course, the upcoming change in administration here, I'm wondering if you have any update on whether it will deploy as planned, or whether there's been a hold put on it.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any change in plans for the deployment of this anti-ballistic missile battery in South Korea based on some of the political turmoil that we've seen in the Republic of Korea.\nOver the last couple of months, as some of this political situation has persisted, I've repeated our commitment to the strength of the alliance between the United States and South Korea. And our two countries have been discussing for some time now the potential deployment of additional equipment and technology to South Korea that would ensure they can protect themselves from the missile threat that emanates from North Korea.\nAnd our commitment to the safety and security of the South Korean people has not changed. It is a commitment that has persisted through transitions of the U.S. presidency. It is a commitment that has persisted through transitions of the South Korean presidency. And it's our hope and expectation that the U.S. commitment to that alliance and support for the South Korean people, even as they face this menacing threat from North Korea, will not change, despite some of the changes in government that are slated for the months ahead.\nJustin.\nQ: I'm wondering if you had any reaction to President Duterte saying that he used to personally prowl the streets on a motorcycle looking for a chance to kill criminals.\nMR. EARNEST: Those comments are deeply troubling and they certainly are at odds with the Philippine government's stated commitment to due process and rule of law.\nThe United States continues to be concerned by the widespread reports of extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities in the Philippines. The United States strongly supports the idea of a thorough, credible and transparent investigation into these reports.\nThe United States stands with the people of the Philippines as they confront the drug problem that's having a negative impact on the security situation in the country. And the United States has provided significant security assistance to assist in the investigation of those crimes, and to assist the Filipino government in handling this threat to their security.\nBut we continue to believe it's critically important that the government in the Philippines observe and even protect the basic universal human rights that are central to that democracy and ours. And that's an important principle and one that we believe is worth upholding.\nQ: We've had a lot of conversations in different contexts in the last couple days about whether the U.S. should have done more when they see signs of trouble. Your reaction so far to a range of comments from President Duterte has been sort of to condemn them or to express concern, but not to cut off U.S. support or change our sort of relationship. What does he have to say or do to prompt some sort of official reaction from the U.S. beyond just expression of concern?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, what you have heard me say on a number of occasions now is that we often hear rhetoric from President Duterte or other senior officials in the government of the Philippines vowing to carry out radical changes in their policy of cooperating with or investing in the U.S.-Philippines alliance. In almost every situation, that rhetoric has not been matched by action. And so you've also heard me say in a variety of settings that we certainly are paying attention to the words and comments that are being expressed, but we're paying more careful attention to the actions.\nAnd that is certainly true in this case with regard to our relationship in the Philippines. And that's why the United States remains committed to working effectively with the government in the Philippines to advance our shared interests. And that's everything from the domestic security situation in the Philippines, including the drug trade. It also relates to our support for their efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to some of the competing land claims in the South China Sea. It also relates to some of the economic and cultural ties between the United States and the Philippines that extends back for multiple generations.\nSo this is an important relationship and an important alliance, and one that we believe is worth investing in because it benefits not just the American people it also benefits the people of the Philippines as well.\nQ: Kellyanne Conway was on TV this morning and said that it was \"incredibly irresponsible\" for you to have said that Donald Trump called for hacking by Russia, and the defense is that some of Mr. Trump's supporters have said that he was joking at the time and was speaking after the hack had already occurred, so it's not really relevant to the situation. I'm wondering if you have a reaction to what she said about your comments.\nMR. EARNEST: Me? (Laughter.) I do have some comments; I don't think you'd be surprised to hear that. Hard to know where to start, but let me start with this.\nThe primary defense -- well, first of all, it is just a fact -- you all have it on tape -- that the Republican nominee for President was encouraging Russia to hack his opponent because he believed that that would help his campaign. That's not a controversial statement. I'm not trying to be argumentative, but I am trying to acknowledge a basic fact. And all of you saw it. This is not in dispute.\nNow, I recognize that the defense from the Trump campaign is that he was joking. I don't think anybody at the White House thinks it's funny that an adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyber activity to destabilize our democracy. That's not a joke. Nobody at the White House thought it was a joke. Nobody in the intelligence community thought it was a joke. I'm not aware that any members of Congress in either party that was briefed on this matter multiple times dating back to the summer thought it was a joke. Senator Rubio put out a comment shortly before the election indicating that he took it rather seriously. So I think that's not a particularly persuasive defense that's being mounted by the President-elect's team.\nI'll say two other things about this. I know that they also object to the idea, something that I said yesterday, that somehow -- I made the observation yesterday that Mr. Trump was obviously aware of the fact that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity and that that malicious cyber activity was having a negative impact on his opponent's campaign and was boosting his. He's not the only person that knew that. That was something that was being widely reported and was evident to anybody who was reading the newspaper.\nI don't know exactly what source he was using. He could have been relying on news reports. Maybe somebody on Capitol Hill who had been briefed about this matter had informed him or his team about it. It's also possible that he consulted with one of his closest aides, Roger Stone, who back in July -- July 27th, to be precise -- tweeted \"of course the Russians hacked @HillaryClinton's email.\"\nSo, again, I don't know if it was a staff meeting, or he had access to a briefing, or he was just basing his assessment on a large number of published reports, but Mr. Trump obviously knew that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity that was helping him and hurting Secretary Clinton's campaign. And again, these are all facts that are not in dispute. This is not a situation where we are launching charges and countercharges, or I'm offering up my opinion and hoping that it will be considered more persuasive than the opinion that's offered up by somebody else. These are just facts.\nAnd I know that we've also heard from the President-elect's team that they're concerned that there's some effort to delegitimize his presidency. Well, I think President Obama has made clear, literally hours after the votes were tabulated and reported, that he and his team were committed to a smooth and effective transition to the Trump administration, and all of the available evidence about our actions since then indicates how seriously the Obama administration has fulfilled that responsibility that we have. But there are others on the outside who are raising these questions, and apparently that is striking a nerve with the President-elect's team.\nOne way to deal with that is to start answering these questions, and not just relying on a defense suggesting that the rhetoric of the Republican nominee was a joke when nobody thought it was funny. And there's plenty of evidence to indicate he knew exactly what he was talking about. It might be time to not attack the intelligence community, but actually be supportive of a thorough, transparent, rigorous, nonpolitical investigation into what exactly happened, and to cooperate with it, and to support it.\nBut they're probably not that interested in advice from me, so -- but I don't think I'm -- I guess I am biased in saying that is advice that I have to offer based on years of experience and I think it would serve them well to follow it.\nRon.\nQ: So just to be clear, when this malicious activity was detected, what did the White House do about it? Anything? You often say the statement was put out.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a statement that we -- well, first of all, this was thoroughly investigated and this was included in The New York Times report that appeared a couple days ago that sort of went through in rigorous detail all of the work that was done to investigate these hacks and these breaches. And the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, a variety of intelligence agencies were all investigating to learn as much as they possibly could. There were extensive briefings that were provided to Capitol Hill dating back to the summer, and there was an effort to learn as much as we could about what had happened.\nThere also was an effort that was undertaken by experts at the Department of Homeland Security to fortify the elections administration's equipment of states and cities and counties all across the country to make sure that they could defend themselves against potential Russian action that would manipulate the vote count or at least interfere with people's ability to cast ballots. That was a significant undertaking. We had to go and work with local jurisdictions in all 50 states.\nAnd we also tried to build strong political support on Capitol Hill among Democrats and Republicans to send a clear signal to Democrats and Republicans who were administering the elections that this isn't a partisan effort. And we did encounter some resistance from Republicans to our efforts to do that -- Senator McConnell in particular.\nQ: Beyond reinforcing of the voting apparatus --\nMR. EARNEST: That's not an insignificant proposition because that is central to our democracy. And it is a lot of work because it's not -- we don't just go to one agency. We have to go to agencies in 50 states in order to get that done -- some agencies that are skeptical and suspicious of the motives of the federal government. But yet we did succeed in that. And what the intelligence agencies concluded is that there was no increase in malicious cyber activity on the part of the Russians that did succeed on Election Day in preventing people from voting or preventing those votes from being accurately counted.\nQ: But did the United States retaliate against Russia for this?\nMR. EARNEST: The President determined once the intelligence community had reached this assessment that a proportional response was appropriate. But at this point, I don't have anything to say about whether or not that response has been carried out or whether additional responses could be deployed.\nQ: All right. And that's the question, is how can it be effective if, in fact, we don't know whether it happened or not? Will the Russians know when it happened and that it happened?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, Ron, I'm just not going to be in a position to talk about potential responses. And I know that's frustrating. What I can tell you is that there may be an opportunity in the future where we can talk in more detail about what the responses is, has been, or will be.\nQ: But tell me how the response can be effective unless it's -- if it's not made public.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's a difficult question to answer because the United States retains significant, extensive cyber capabilities that exceed the capabilities that are wielded by any other country in the world. And to detail those cyber capabilities would be to potentially undermine our ability to use them.\nSo, unfortunately, that's not something that I can discuss from here. But there are a range of proportional responses that the President and his team believe would be an appropriate response.\nQ: And just back to the statement of October about the highest levels of the Russian government being responsible for this -- was that intentionally worded to point a finger at Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: This is a statement that was written by the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security, so you should ask them exactly what their intent was. But my reading of it was that it was not intended to be subtle. But that's based on my reading of it. You'd have to ask them what they --\nQ: So it points a finger at Vladimir Putin.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, you'd have to ask them what their intent was.\nQ: Is that your interpretation of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the reference to senior-most officials in Russia would lead me to conclude that, based on my personal reading and not based on any knowledge that I have that may be classified or otherwise, pretty obvious that they were referring to the senior-most government official in Russia.\nQ: Last one. The Russians say that this is laughable, this is nonsense that they did this, that their President was involved in any of this. What's your response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not surprised.\nKevin.\nQ: I want to ask you about Planned Parenthood and the White House's effort to ensure their funding. And I'm curious if you could explain, in particular, for the Americans who are well aware of the fact that the federal government cannot legally fund abortions, with the exception of rape, incest or the endangerment of the life of the mother, why the President did what he did, and how did he go about doing it? Without getting too much into the weeds on Title X.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Obama administration did implement a rule that essentially prevents the federal government from discriminating against specific service providers. And again, I think this goes back to a principle that really should resonate with a lot of conservatives. The Obama administration is suggesting that the federal government shouldn't be getting in the way of people getting access to quality, affordable health insurance, or quality, affordable health care. And Planned Parenthood is an organization that provides extensive health care services to men and women in communities, large and small, all across the country. That's just a fact.\nWhat the Obama administration has also done is carefully followed the law to ensure that we are abiding by this longstanding rule that prevents federal funding of abortions, with the exceptions that you outlined. And that is consistent with the law that's on the books. It's also consistent with a principle that we have prioritized, which is that getting access to quality health care is not a privilege, it's a right. And we want to make it possible for as many people as possible to get access to that health care. And that's the idea behind this rule.\nQ: But there are those, in particular in the states that feel like this is an egregious overreach by the administration, that feel like this should be a state's issue that they can certainly handle without this added layer from the federal government. What would you say to them?\nMR. EARNEST: I would say to that that we're talking about federal funding and what the federal government can do with that federal funding. And so this is actually empowering patients to make their own choices about their health care. And that is a principle that conservatives -- that should really resonate with conservatives. And I guess I'll leave it to them to explain why it doesn't.\nQ: Last, I just want to -- a little bit far afield, but I was reading an interesting piece that accused the President of being so focused on creating the Iran nuclear deal that he in effect took his eye off the ball, or was less focused on other issues abroad, in particular the growing threat from Iran and perhaps even Russia. What would you -- or rather Russia and China, I should say. What would you say to critics who feel like the President was so dead-set on making history and propping up the Iran nuclear deal and pushing it over the finish line that he didn't see, perhaps, or react as quickly to threats from Russia in particular. We can use the cyber threat as just one example of that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see the argument that was made in the piece that you've referenced, but I think, in general, what I would say is simply that the successful implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was not just a major national security priority of the United States, it was a major national security priority of some of our closest allies and partners in the region and around the world.\nIsrael was deeply concerned about the prospect of Iran getting their hands on nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia and other counties in the Gulf were also deeply concerned about this prospect. There were countries in Europe who are within range of some of Iran's ballistic missile capabilities, were deeply concerned about the prospect that Iran could put one of those nuclear weapons on top of one of those ballistic missiles. So preventing Iran from obtaining that nuclear weapon wasn't just a priority of the President's, it was a priority of the international community's.\nAnd I would just point out that when President Obama took office, that was the case. The international community was fractured in terms of trying to design a strategy that would successfully prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. So President Obama didn't just have to identify the priority, he actually had to organize the international community to go and achieve it. And that's exactly what we've done. And that is --\nQ: Did it distract him, though, from the focus on Russia and China? In particular, when you look at some of the things that happened -- Russia running off into Ukraine and whatnot, and China with the South China Sea. Did it at least in part take his focus off those things? Would you reject that notion?\nMR. EARNEST: I would utterly reject that notion as not being an accurate description of the situation.\nQ: Okay, last one. You looked like you were chopping at the bit when I asked Jason about why it didn't seem to resonate, some of the great numbers that you all have been touting. Month after month after month, we talked about job growth, and yet for some reason, at least among many of the working-class, they don't feel that. Did you sense that? And if you did, where was the disconnect? Was it a lack of messaging? Was it a lack of understanding how great things are for them? You tell me.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the reason that I reacted is I'm not sure there's much evidence to indicate that a lot of people supported Mr. Trump because they had more confidence in his economic policies than they did the President's.\nQ: I wouldn't make that connection. I was suggesting that given what we hear here often, what seems to have been missing in terms of -- I mean, at least in theory you would say, hey, listen, the economy is going great, people should really -- that should really resonate with people and they should be ready to run up the hill and continue the policies.\nMR. EARNEST: Unless they were just voting on something else. And I think that's my suggestion, is that they had other things that were influencing their decision about who to vote for. And I think that's a testament to the strength of the economy that President Obama has presided over, and I think it's a testament to the strong public support that exists for the economic strategy that we have pursued. And I'm not surprised that there's strong public support for our economic strategy because the benefits of our economic strategy are obvious and widely felt.\nSteven. Nice to see you. Welcome to your new seat.\nQ: Thank you. Mark Knoller pointed out this morning that Barack Obama has never, before now, allowed a bill to become law without his signature. So why did he not sign the Iran Sanctions Extension Act? And were you aware? The National Archives tells us it hasn't happened since December of 1995.\nMR. EARNEST: It's been a long time. It is -- well, let me go through some basics here, and then I'll explain the decision. We've been saying for quite some time that it is not necessary to extend the Iran Sanctions Act because the executive branch, the Obama administration retains all of the needed executive authority to implement sanctions against Iran. We have the authority to waive those sanctions, which we did, in the context of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We have the ability to implement and ramp up sanctions against Iran for their destabilizing activity in the Middle East, for the development of their missile program, for their support for terrorism, for their lack of respect for basic human rights. And we have used that authority even since the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was implemented.\nBecause of our significant concern about some of those activities, we also have all the executive authority that we need to snap sanctions back into place if Iran violates the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. So we retain all of the authorities that we need to carry out this policy, and that is why we have said for more than a year that the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act was unnecessary.\nNow, at the same time, on the other side, a clean extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, like the one that landed on the President's desk, is consistent with our commitments under the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That's an important point because the President was rather forward-leaning in making clear that he would veto any effort to undermine the nuclear deal. This legislation does not undermine the nuclear deal.\nSo we find ourselves in a situation that I'm not sure that we've encountered in eight years, which is that the bill doesn't meet the standard of something that we would veto, but it's also not something that the administration believes is necessary. So the President made a decision to allow that bill to become law without his signature.\nBut I will say that this decision to allow the bill to become law without the President's signature is also part of a message that we're sending to Congress, and it's simply this: If Congress does blow up the deal that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, they're going to have to deal with the consequences. And the consequences are grave. And we have seen irresponsible efforts on the part of some members of Congress to advocate for and to write up and submit pieces of legislation that would violate the deal, that would cause the deal to break up, that would, in all likelihood, prompt Iran to kick inspectors out of their country. These are inspectors who right now are keeping closer tabs on the Iranian nuclear program than any other nuclear program in the world.\nWhat they would also precipitate by passing legislation that undermines the deal, it would cause the international coalition that we have built to shatter, and it would be very difficult for the United States to make the case to countries like India and China and Japan that they should help us enforce those sanctions. We would have a hard time convincing them to help us enforce those sanctions because the reason that the deal blew up is the fault of the United States Congress.\nSo this is a -- President Obama is only in office here for another month. And after that, Congress will have to deal with the consequences if they choose to pursue irresponsible legislation that would blow up the deal.\nNow, just to be crystal-clear about this, the Iran Sanctions Act is consistent with our commitments under the international agreement, and the President did not veto this bill because it does not undermine the deal. But there's been plenty of rhetoric and plenty of legislative work done on legislation that would blow up the deal. And this is a message that if the United States Congress blows up the deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, they will have to deal with the grave consequences that ensue.\nSo thank you for indulging me on the long answer.\nQ: Tom Wheeler announcing his departure from the FCC the day that President Obama leaves office. Is that the end of net neutrality? What does it mean?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, President Obama has been pleased by the service of Chairman Wheeler. He runs an independent agency, so we are limited in how much we can say. But the President appointed him to that job because he's somebody who's a good manager and knew those issues well, and certainly shared the President's approach, generally speaking, to dealing with some of these issues.\nAnd obviously the next President will have an opportunity to choose someone that shares his view of these issues. And maybe the President-elect was meeting with one of them yesterday when he sat down with tech executives from all over the country. Maybe one of them would be interested in taking this job. We'll see.\nAndrew.\nQ: China seems to have abandoned its pledge not to militarize features in the South China Sea, with aerial photography showing the deployment of anti-aircraft guns and other weapons systems. I'm wondering if the administration has a response.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports, Andrew. I cannot confirm them independently from here. I think the most direct response comes from the joint declaration that was signed by all of the leaders of the ASEAN countries this past February at the summit that President Obama held in Sunnylands. And that statement affirmed, \"the shared commitment to maintain peace, security and stability in the region, ensuring maritime security and safety, including the rights of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful maritime commerce as described in the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea\" -- and this is the key part -- \"as well as non-militarization and self-restraint in the conduct of activities.\"\nThe United States has been very clear that we make no independent claims to the land features in the South China Sea. It is our view that competing claims should be resolved not by might or through military action, but rather through diplomacy and negotiation. And that's what we're encouraging all parties to do. And we certainly, in pursuit of that goal, are encouraging all parties to refrain from the kinds of actions that would heighten this tension and risk military conflict, because our ultimate goal is a resolution through diplomacy and negotiations. And the U.S. interest in this situation is in protecting the free flow of commerce and the freedom of navigation in this region of the world.\nBillions of dollars of commerce transits this region regularly, and disruption of that navigation could have a negative impact on the global economy. And that, of course would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, and that's our chief interest here.\nQ: A number of European countries have summoned the ambassadors of Russia and Iran over events in Syria. Obviously there's no Iranian ambassador, but does the administration plan to do the same, or has it done the same?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a plan to do that, but if that's something that happens, we'll let you know. Obviously U.S. diplomats have been in close touch with Russian diplomats not just over the last several days but over the last several months on this issue, and I know that just yesterday Secretary Kerry communicated in a phone conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov. So we don't need to summon the Russia ambassador to the United States to make clear our deep concerns about the way that Russia has conducted themselves in Syria.\nQ: And a final question. A few days ago the U.S. introduced sanctions against some officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the delay of elections. Bloomberg today had a report on pretty staggering levels of wealth and assets accumulated by Kabila and his family. So I was wondering if those assets and individuals could be the target of sanctions should Kabila decide to stay in office against the constitution?\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, just to make sure you get an accurate answer to your question, I'm going to refer you to Treasury Department for the details about the way that those sanctions are likely to be implemented.\nMichelle.\nQ: Is sounds like you have no dispute or quarrel with the information that has been put out there on saying that Vladimir Putin had a direct role in the hacking.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm saying is there was -- that I don't have new information to share from here, but there was an October 7th statement from the intelligence community that spoke pretty directly and, in my own personal opinion, quite unsubtly, to this question.\nQ: Okay. So -- but you're not addressing whether those reports are accurate or whether you have a problem with the accuracy of any of those reports?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not discussing the accuracy of those reports. I'd refer you to the intelligence community for their own assessment. They're aware of the facts firsthand and they can try to describe to you exactly what their official view is of that circumstance.\nQ: And let's just say that in a situation like this, if there is the head of state directly involved in something of this level, would that change the proportional response that is formulated to respond to it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's difficult for me to talk about potential response options. I think what I will say is, as the President and his team consider proportional responses, a wide variety of aspects of the situation will be considered. Proportionality includes things like the impact and the sophistication of the attack -- the malicious activity. So they'll cast a wide net in considering exactly what happened and formulating an effective proportional response.\nI would acknowledge -- which may be what you're thinking, --that designing a proportional response seems inherently subjective, and I would acknowledge that that's true. But it means the President and the experts on his team using the best knowledge at their disposal and their knowledge of U.S. capabilities to determine what would be appropriate.\nQ: Does it make it much more serious if the head of a state is involved in something like this than not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think we've known for some time, since even before the election, that senior -most Russian officials were involved. So the U.S. intelligence community recognized from the beginning how serious this was.\nQ: Okay. And you talked a couple of times this week about the cyber capabilities, but obviously they don't prevent the hacking of an individual's email, and all of that taken together, we've seen how it could potentially affect a presidential election. You also tried to convey confidence a number of times leading up to the election and after in the system. But if we see this happen -- like I think for many it's hard to believe that we're even talking about this right now, and then days later we have more word of another hack and an unprecedented hack. So how can the American people have confidence in elections that follow if maybe the weakest link is going to be somebody's Yahoo! or Gmail account?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, how our democracy responds to this situation is an important question, and a question that the President and his team is very focused on. And I would expect that this is a question that the next administration will have to carefully consider as well.\nAs we stated in the -- as the intelligence community, just to be precise, stated back in October, the goal of this Russian effort was to erode public confidence in our democracy. And that's not an effort that can be countered solely in cyberspace. It raises questions about our democracy and about the kind of public debate that we have in this country. It raises questions about how the media handles information that's been the target of a hack and leak operation carried out by an American adversary. It raises questions about how American voters view the news media and view the information that's presented by the news media. All these kinds of questions are raised.\nThe President retains substantial confidence in the durability of our democracy and in our system of government, and in the ability of news organizations like yours to respond to this challenge, but these are the kinds of questions that have to be asked.\nQ: And I mean part of the debate and the harsh reactions leading up the election surrounded over the statement that the election was going to be rigged. It was said in a much different context, but now we're seeing this. Does it seem to you like this election was rigged, except it was rigged by Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I feel the need to restate something I've said before, so just bear with me on this, which is that there was reason to be concerned on the part of the intelligence communities about Russia potentially attacking the election infrastructure of the country in cyberspace. And that is why a focal point of our efforts through the summer and fall was to mobilize substantial federal resources and to work to build political support for a federal government effort to help cities, counties, and states defend their elections infrastructure from Russian hacking.\nAnd the good news is that the intelligence community has reported that they did not observe an increase in Russian malicious cyber activity on Election Day that interfered with the ability of anybody to cast a ballot or any election official to count it accurately. So that is good news. That didn't happen by accident. That was not a foregone conclusion back in early October. That was not a foregone conclusion in early November.\nQ: But we're seeing that that may not matter, and maybe the definition of rigged kind of depends on how you're looking at it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it would matter had the Russians hacked it. So the reason I just keep going back to this is because it's important to -- and this sort of goes to Ron's question earlier about sort of what did the White House and the government do -- this was an effort that took place behind the scenes, and it had to, I think for obvious reasons, but we shouldn't underestimate the outcome of that effort.\nBut you're asking a somewhat different question that's just as legitimate, which is, even if the Department of Homeland Security can mobilize all the resources and work effectively with state and local officials to protect our elections infrastructure, isn't there still a vulnerability that exists when it comes to the way that the 300 million people who live in this country consume information?\nAnd, look, I think that these are difficult questions. And I think everybody has got a role here, particularly the news media, particularly citizens who are trying to inform themselves and want to be good consumers of information. But news organizations have had to adapt to a changing news media environment driven by technology for more than a decade now. So I retain confidence, I know the President continues to be confident, that if these questions are asked and the answers are carefully considered, that the U.S. system of democracy is durable and strong enough to withstand some of these changes and even withstand some of these threats.\nQ: Related to this case, we're seeing the selective release of information, we're seeing reports that Vladimir Putin himself determined how that information was going to be released.\nWe're seeing, as you termed it, a \"surprise result\" of the election. So does the administration think that Russia has successfully rigged this election?\nMR. EARNEST: And, Michelle, what I've said about this in the past is still true, that there are a lot of political analysts who have cited a variety of reasons for the surprising outcome of the election. And some of them say that Russia's malicious cyber activity weighed heavily on the result; others discount it. Others suggest that perhaps the public communication of FBI Director Jim Comey about his bureau's investigation of Secretary Clinton's email may have tilted the outcome.\nThere are others who have suggested that Secretary Clinton was a flawed candidate from the start who would never win. Others have suggested that she didn't pursue the right electoral strategy, that she focused on the wrong states. Others have suggested that she should have had a stronger message.\nLook, there are a variety of potential explanations, and that's more of a question for analysts of politics than it is for analysts of intelligence.\nKenneth.\nQ: Josh, one last question on Russian hacking. Just to clarify, to get it on the record, was there a policy decision or even influence to not mention Putin's name in that intelligence report?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, for the wording that's included in the statement I'd refer you to the intelligence community. It was written by them.\nQ: Also, I wanted to ask about a tweet that President-elect Donald Trump said this morning, which was, if Russia or any entity was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act and why did they only complain after Hillary Clinton? I know you addressed that with Ron's question, but with that criticism from a tweet, from Conway's criticism of you, is this smooth transition, is it seeing a bump in the road here? And what's your comment about -- or reaction to that tweet from President-elect Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there's just a simple fact that -- I guess I'm going to break with precedent here and actually respond to a tweet from the President-elect just by pointing to a simple fact, which is that there was a statement that was issued by the intelligence community on October 7th, a month before the election, warning that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity in an attempt to erode confidence in our democracy. And it was obvious to everyone who was paying attention, including the gentleman whose thumbs authored that tweet, that the impact of that malicious activity benefitted the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign. That is, after all, why the President-elect called on Russia to hack Secretary Clinton's email. That is presumably why the coverage of the hack-and-leak operation that Russia carried out was focused on emails from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign staffers, and not the Republican Party and Trump campaign staffers.\nIt wasn't a secret. It's obvious what the impact was. There's a separate question about intent, and there are anonymous figures in the intelligence community that are weighing in all over the place, and I'm not at liberty to do that from here. We're going to rely on intelligence assessments to try to get to the bottom of that if they can.\nBut it's not -- the impact of this operation is not in doubt. It's not in doubt. It benefitted the Trump campaign, and it hurt the Clinton campaign. That's why the Republican nominee was hoping they would do more of it. That's why his staffers were hoping that they would do more of it. That is why in the days leading up to Election Day, the Republican nominee himself was encouraging people to check out WikiLeaks. He thought it would help his campaign, and he knew that when people went to WikiLeaks they weren't going to find damaging information about Steve Bannon or Reince Preibus or the RNC.\nIn fact, there's only evidence of one Republican being hacked and targeted by this hack-and-leak operation, and that one Republican was General Colin Powell, and the only information that was released was him being privately critical of Secretary Clinton.\nSo there's no subtlety. There's no security clearance required to figure out what happened.\nQ: One more. The Trump team claims that the President of the United States cannot have any conflicts of interest by law. Does the White House agree with that? And what steps were taken for President Obama to avoid those potential conflicts, besides a blind trust?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there are a variety of ethical, legal experts in both parties that have raised profound concerns with that approach. President Obama, when he took office, didn't just vow to adhere to the letter of the ethics laws, he went above and beyond the letter of the ethics laws and actually converted all of his financial holdings to Treasury bonds. And as I've pointed out earlier, that was a rather poor personal financial management decision because the Fed was aggressively slashing interest rates.\nSo President Obama lost a lot of money, but it was worth it because freeing himself of even the appearance of a personal financial conflict of interest was in the best interest of the country. And the President has talked about how proud he is that his administration has not been buffeted by the kinds of personal ethical scandals that have plagued other administrations, particularly at the end of a second term. And the President attributes part of that to the example that he set from the top about maintaining an extraordinarily high ethical standard, one that far exceeds even the letter and spirit of the law.\nAnd that is an example that we've all tried to follow. And the American people have benefitted from that and his administration has benefitted from that because we haven't seen these kinds of distracting personal ethical scandals that would otherwise shake confidence in government. And that's a result of the example that was set by the person at the top.\nAndrei. Given all of the conversations about your country in here today, it seems only fair to give you an opportunity to ask a question.\nQ: Josh, I cannot believe that we are having this conversation for weeks.\nMR. EARNEST: You and me both. How about that? We found something we can agree on.\nQ: Live and learn. You'll never know what comes next. So basically I have two. One is a follow-up to Michelle's. You do seem happy to talk about the leaks. You do seem happy. So my question is very simply: Is the White House encouraging the leaks?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course not.\nQ: Is the White House happy that the leaks are happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course not. Andrei, I think there's only been one person who's tried to joke about this. Unfortunately, that person is the President-elect of the United States. This is an extraordinarily serious matter. And I think that's why you've seen such extensive conversation about it in this room, and I think that's why you've seen such a robust response from the intelligence community to this matter. And it's because it's extraordinarily serious.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on that. This is the essence of my bigger question, which is about President Obama's leadership. I think you'll like the premise of my question. I've always thought that President Obama is an extremely intelligent and decent person, well-meaning person. So my question is, after that, if we have that as a premise, how come he wanted the U.S.-Russian relations to be a win-win for both sides? We are now in a situation, obviously, where it is a lose-lose. No matter how we spin it, it's a lose-lose for both of us. But this is not the only one.\nAmerica, in all the eight years, did not have one day where it was completely at peace. There was one war or another, and not all of those wars were inherited by President Obama. And he's a Nobel Peace prize winner. He's like the first African American President, but the race relations in this country have become worse, not better -- worse. You say some things are facts. Those are allegations. But I cannot say that it's a fact; it's an impression I have that they're worse. But many people share this impression. Then, hacking. America is all of a sudden vulnerable to hacking after eight years of Obama leadership. How come? And, of course, the biggest of all is the result of the election. The leadership has been rejected. The preferred candidate has been rejected.\nSo my question, to come to the question, is, who's at fault? Is it Russia that performed all of that? Is it because of Russia that the voters in the U.S. rejected the leadership and the legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I disagree with your assessment about the outcome of the election, because I think there's ample evidence to indicate how strongly the American people feel about and support President Obama personally, and his legacy. President Obama's poll ratings are higher than they've been in quite some time, and certainly exceed -- or at least in the range of, or exceed, every other recent outgoing President. And I think that it is a pretty clear indication of how strongly the American people do feel about his leadership.\nWhen it comes to the question about whether or not Russia is at fault for the outcome of the election, that's not a question for intelligence analysts, that is a question for political analysts to evaluate why people voted the way that they did, and how -- and why the outcome was so unexpected.\nQ: Josh, that's not my question. The question was about the responsibility of the top executive in this country. Does he feel any responsibility for all this?\nMR. EARNEST: When you say for all of this, can you be slightly more precise?\nQ: For the wars, for the race relations, for the deterioration of relations with Russia.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I disagree with your assessment of race relations. With regard to wars, President Obama is quite proud of the efforts that we -- that the United States, in close concert with our allies around the world, with the steps that we have taken to strengthen our national security, to make the United States and our allies safer. The United States has actually been effective and forceful in taking on ISIL. It's actually Russia who has only had one operational gain on the ground inside of Syria, against ISIL, that has had that gain rolled back. And, in fact, the threat posed by ISIL is now worse because of Russia's failed strategy inside of Syria, because ISIL didn't just retake Palmyra, they retook Palmyra and all of the military equipment that the Assad regime, backed by Russia, had moved in there.\nQ: You sound as if you welcome that.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't welcome that at all. I am gravely concerned about the danger that is now heightened because of Russia's failed strategy. And according to what my colleagues at the Pentagon are now saying, it's now U.S. servicemembers, U.S. members of the military that are now going to have to go in and clean up the mess again that was created by Syria, with the backing of the Russians. And when you consider the President's record overall, the fact of the matter is, when you consider what he inherited, when President Obama walked into office, there were 180,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Today, America is safer, and there are only about 15,000 U.S. servicemembers in those two countries. And that represents substantial progress in enhancing our national security but also moving America off a permanent war footing.\nQ: And that's why we have the results of the election.\nMR. EARNEST: Bob, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks so much, Josh. Given all the talk about Russian hacking, should the Electoral College voters take into account the influence of Russian hacking the distribution of emails in their voting, which is going to happen on Monday? And do they have the constitutional right to do so?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I know that there are a number of electors who have spoken publicly, raising some concerns, some questions about how they should fulfill their constitutional obligations. I think that's evidence of how serious many of these electors take their constitutional responsibilities. But I'm not going to stand here and tell them how to vote, or stand here and tell them how to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities. This is a responsibility that they've been entrusted with. And there certainly is ample information about the election that has already been made public. But ultimately it's up to the Electoral College to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibility.\nGregory?\nQ: Josh, will there be a press conference tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: I anticipate that I will not be the one standing here tomorrow, but we'll be able to confirm that for you before the end of the day today.\nThanks, everybody. And if I don't see you, happy holidays.\nEND 1:20 P.M.

(Laughter.) I keep telling her, girl, you've got to come out of your shell! (Laughter.) But Taraji has been all over the place just doing her thing, and we are so glad that you are here with us today. Our girl Janelle Monбe. (Applause.) This is like my little child here, my other one. Congratulations. You, too, are all over the place. I'm so proud of you.\nWe have the great Octavia Spencer, who is here. (Applause.) And she's just collecting all the stuff. (Laughter.) All the accolades and all that. We are extremely proud of you and honored to have you back here with us. We have the Kevin Costner, who my -- (applause) -- who is still as handsome as ever. I said that after my husband left. (Laughter.) He's not watching.\nMimi is here, as well, who is responsible for making this film a reality. (Applause.) And our director, Ted -- Ted is in the house, as well. (Applause.) And I know that there were many, many, many more people who played a part in making this film such a tremendous statement.\nNow, as you all saw, because you guys got to see the film, \"Hidden Figures\" is about one of our greatest American stories: How we did what for so long had seemed impossible -- we put a man into space, and then we put a man on the moon. And we did this long before we had any of the advanced technologies that we have today. In fact, the smartphones that many of you have in your pockets right now and are holding up -- because that's what you do -- (laughter) -- right now, they have more computing power than the technology that NASA used to send astronauts into space back then. Just imagine that. You have more power at your fingertips today than they had to do what they did.\nSo NASA had to rely on human computers. And they had to rely on geniuses like the women featured in this film. And that's really why I think this movie is so important –- because it doesn't just celebrate what we achieved, but, more importantly, how we achieved it.\nAnd this is something that I want you young people to understand. I want you to take this away. Because when you're faced with the overwhelming challenges in life -- and in this case it was winning the space race, it was a challenge that we were actually losing at first, the United States. We didn't shrink back from that challenge. I want to say that again -- we did not shrink back from that challenge. And we didn't point fingers or cast blame. What the United States did, what NASA did, what these amazing women did was that they got to work. They just did the work.\nWe sought out the very best minds in math and engineering at the time, people with diverse perspectives who could think in ways that no one had ever thought before -- people like many of you in this room, the people like Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan.\nNow, these women couldn't even drink from the same water fountain or use the same bathroom as many of their colleagues -- and you all are too young to even imagine that. You've read that in the history books, but that's how close this history is. These women -- their families are still breathing beings, and this happened in my lifetime and in many of your parents' and grandparents' lifetimes. And folks didn't always take these women seriously because they were black, and also because they were women.\nBut they didn't listen to those doubters. You understand? They did not listen to the haters -- (laughter) -- because they're always out there. (Laughter.) They're out there even today.\nWhat they listened to was other voices -- teachers who said that they had something special to offer. See, because in all the noise that you hear, there's always a voice of power and beauty and positivity. Each and every one of you, if you think about it, no matter what negativity you hear, there is always some ray of positive hope out there that you can choose to take in. These women did that.\nThey listened to their families and their friends who said, \"you are worthy,\" and they told them, \"don't ever let anyone tell you that you are less-than.\" So you have to choose to let those voices into your life, and block out those that don't reflect your reality. And each of these women decided to believe in herself and step up when her country needed her.\nAnd more than anything else, that is the great American story that is told in this film. That's why this film is so important.\nIt's the story of how, time and again, when we have tapped the talent and energy of all of our people -- all of it -- I say this to my staff -- as we move forward in life and we get access to these seats of power, these tables of power, I want you to look around and make sure there's diversity at the table. (Applause.) Because you don't come up with the right answer if everyone at the table looks the same and thinks the same and has the same experience -- you never come up with the best answer.\nSo when you get these seats at these tables of power, your obligation is to make sure the conversation is diverse. Because what we saw in this film is that when we pull together men and women, people of every background and color and faith, immigrants who've come here from across the globe to make America their home -- when we bring all of that brainpower to the table, anything is possible, even going to the moon, right? (Applause.)\nThat is how America won the space race in the 1960s and, as I said, that approach is just as important today. Because make no mistake about it, that's how we're going to fight all the challenges that we face on this planet. Whether it's climate change or cancer or ending hunger, by seeking out the most talented, passionate, skilled people we can find and putting them to work, regardless of what they look like or where they come from or how they pray or who they love,that's how we become the best America that we can be.\nAnd that is the lesson that I want you all to take from this movie. And if you take anything from this eight years of us being in this White House, I want you to take that message with you, particularly all the young people here today, all the young women here today. I want you to see that it does not matter what you look like, it doesn't matter how much money your parents have -- none of that matters. Skin color, gender is the most ridiculous defining trait that we cling to. It doesn't matter.\nWhat matters is that you believe in your own potential, and that's for sure. You have to believe in you first. Because people will try to tear you down, I guarantee you that. There will never be a point at which people will 100 percent be cheering you on. So when you hit those barriers in life, all you have is your belief in yourself. That's all you have to fall back on.\nWhat also matters is how hard you're willing to work. Because none of this is easy -- and it's not supposed to be. Because then everybody could do it, right? (Laughter.) How much work you want to put into the things you care about -- President Obama works very hard. He is a serious man who takes his job seriously. And we are counting on you to be that in whatever you choose to be, whether it's science or math or dance or teaching -- you name it. None of these men and women here achieved what they achieved without working hard at it and making some sacrifices and overcoming a lot of failure. So we want you to take that away.\nAs Katherine Johnson has said -- and these are her words -- she said, \"Stick with it. No matter the problem, it can be solved.\" And that's really good advice. Look at this eight years. We were supposed to be hidden. (Laughter.) People didn't even want to believe we were real. But here we are, eight years later. (Applause.)\nBut it's up to all of you, our young people, to continue that legacy. It's your turn now. All right? So you have to be prepared. You have to get a great education. You have to go to college. It is particularly important in this day and age. You have got to be educated. So take care of your business in high school. High school, middle school -- these are stepping stones. It may feel like these times are important, but this is a dot on the map of your life. So don't take anything too seriously; don't take anything to heart that happens now -- this is nothing. The only problem is, is if you waste this time, if you squander this time and then you shut the door on all the possibilities. Life gets great when you're my age if you've gone to college.\nToday, I'm free. (Laughter.) I'm really free because I have an education -- not because I'm First Lady, because I have an education. So if you want to be like me, I want you all to focus in school. I want you to put down your phones -- (laughter and applause) -- a little bit more. (Applause.) And I want you to keep in mind the amazing women that were portrayed in this movie. This is a true gift. They didn't have movies like this when I was growing up. (Laughter.) And I am so grateful to all of you for bringing this film to life and bringing these women out of the shadows, because it's not just important for the girls in this room to see it, but people all over the world to be reminded of how we got here as a country. We got here on the backs of those hidden figures and we can never forget.\nSo thank you all. Congratulations. We love you.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "APP NOTE: The  Economic Report of the President  can be found at:  http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports.php", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122486", "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\nEight years ago when I took office, our economy was in crisis. We were just months into the worst recession since the Great Depression, with unemployment rising rapidly toward a peak of 10 percent. Nearly 800,000 Americans were losing their jobs each month, and home prices and the stock market had plummeted. The auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Many American families struggled to pay their bills, and millions had lost their homes.\nFaced with this crisis, my Administration acted quickly, taking steps to shore up the financial system; cut taxes for working families; invest in infrastructure, clean energy, and teacher jobs; help families refinance their homes; and rescue the auto industry. These actions stemmed the tide of the crisis and laid the foundation for a stronger economy over the long term.\nToday, thanks to the resilience of the American people, our economy has emerged as the strongest and most durable in the world. By nearly every economic measure, America is better off than when I took office. We are in the midst of the longest streak of job growth on record. U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs since early 2010. The unemployment rate has been cut by more than half from its peak, falling much faster than economists expected. Rising home prices have brought millions of homeowners back above water, we are less reliant on foreign oil than we have been in nearly three decades, and we have cut our budget deficit by two-thirds as a share of the economy.\nMost importantly, wages have begun to rise again for working families. In 2015, median household income rose at the fastest rate on record, with the typical family earning an additional $2,800. The poverty economic report of the president rate fell by more than any year since 1968. And data indicate that these gains have continued in 2016, with wages rising over 2.7 percent at an annual rate so far this year, much faster than inflation.\nWhile American families have made remarkable progress during the recovery, my Administration has also strengthened the long-term foundation of our economy and worked to ensure that every American has a fair chance to succeed if they work hard. We enacted the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and reshaped our healthcare system, expanded opportunity by making education more affordable and our tax code fairer, and increased our economy's resilience by strengthening the financial system and addressing climate change. These efforts have yielded undeniable results.\nToday, 20 million more American adults have health insurance. On top of that, more than 3 million additional children have health insurance today than in 2008, thanks in large part to the ACA and other actions under my Administration. Our uninsured rate has hit its lowest level ever, and insurance companies can no longer discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. At the same time, we have slowed the growth of health costs dramatically. The average premium for a family who gets coverage on the job is $3,600 lower today than it would be if premium growth had matched the decade before the ACA. All of these changes pay dividends for our economy.\nWe have also worked to ensure that all American families can share in the benefits of the economy, not just those at the top, and we have succeeded in rolling back some of the rise in inequality since the 1970s. Tax changes since 2009 have increased the share of income going to the bottom 99 percent of families by more than any Administration since at least 1960. These tax changes and the ACA will boost incomes for our lowest-income families by 18 percent, or $2,200.\nOver the long term, education provides the surest path to increasing economic opportunity. During my Administration, we have increased access to early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to record highs, and encouraged States to adopt higher standards and provide better training for teachers. And to help make college more affordable, we have doubled investments in Pell Grants and college tax credits; simplified the application for Federal student aid; and helped more than 5 million borrowers cap their monthly student loan payments.\nFinally, we have made our economy more resilient against future challenges. After the financial crisis, we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms in history. Banks have sharply increased the size of their capital buffers, there are new tough limits on risky behavior by banks, and we have brought dark corners of the shadow banking industry under the regulatory umbrella, all of which make another crisis less likely. We have new tools to guard against another \"too big to fail\" scenario and a new consumer watchdog to hold financial institutions accountable.\nSustainable economic growth also requires addressing climate change, and since 2008, we have seen U.S. emissions fall even as our economy has grown. America's economy is becoming more energy efficient and less carbon intensive. Our policies helped to catalyze this change: In 2009, the Recovery Act made a historic investment in clean energy, and we have since increased incentives for renewable energy like wind and solar, improved energy efficiency, and implemented the first-ever greenhouse gas standards for power plants, cars, and trucks. And America's leadership on climate issues helped pave the way for the Paris Agreement, in which almost 200 countries committed to take concrete steps to reduce emissions.\nOur economic progress over the past eight years has been nothing short of remarkable, and I am proud of everything my Administration has accomplished. But I have always acknowledged that the work of perfecting our union, and making our economy work for every American, would take far longer than my time in office.\nAs I pass the baton to my successor, much work remains to continue strengthening our economy and, most importantly, lifting wages for working families. It is no secret that our openness to new ideas and inclusivity are part of what make the United States the most resilient economy in the world. Continuing our technological progress and innovation, engaging with the world economy through trade, and welcoming immigrants and new American families will create shared growth and help define our economy for the coming decades.\nThe first step is to make smart, long-term investments that raise productivity, like boosting funding for infrastructure and research and development. We must also promote competition and innovation in the economy and open new markets for American businesses through high-standards trade agreements.\nBut strengthening economic growth is only half of the equation. We must also make sure that workers can share in that prosperity by creating new, well-paid jobs and preparing workers for them. That means investing in education from Pre-K all the way through college and increasing access to apprenticeships and other career pathways. It means giving workers a bigger voice and setting fair rules of the road by strengthening collective bargaining, raising the Federal minimum wage, expanding access to paid leave, and supporting retirement savings. And it means making our tax system fairer so that those at the top pay their fair share.\nFinally, we must ensure that growth is sustainable by continuing to address the global risk of climate change, by increasing the safety and accountability of our financial system, and by making responsible fiscal decisions.\nOver the past eight years, our country has come back from a once-in-a-lifetime economic crisis and emerged even stronger. For all the work that remains, a new foundation has been laid. A new future is ours to write. I have never been more optimistic about America's future, and I am confident that this incredible journey that we are on as Americans will continue.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House\nDecember 2016", "timestamp": "2016-12-15", "title": "Message to Congress Transmitting the Economic Report of the President"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annexes were published in the  Federal Register  on December 20.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119917", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\n1. Section 915(b) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (the \"TFTEA\") (19 U.S.C. 4454) confers authority upon the President to provide preferential treatment for eligible articles imported directly from Nepal into the customs territory of the United States if the President determines that Nepal meets the eligibility requirements specified in section 915(b)(1)(A) of the TFTEA, taking into account the factors specified in section 915(b)(1)(B) of the TFTEA.\n2. Pursuant to section 915(b) of the TFTEA, I have determined that Nepal meets the eligibility requirements of section 915(b)(1)(A), taking into account the factors specified in section 915(b)(1)(B).\n3. Section 915(c) of the TFTEA describes the requirements for articles from Nepal to be considered eligible for duty-free treatment. Pursuant to section 915(c)(2)(A)(iv) of the TFTEA, the President may designate certain articles as eligible for duty-free treatment when imported from Nepal if, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (Commission) in accordance with section 503(e) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the \"Trade Act\") (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from Nepal.\n4. Pursuant to sections 915(c)(2)(A)(iv) of the TFTEA, and after receiving advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the Trade Act, I have determined to designate the articles included in Annex I of this proclamation as eligible for duty-free treatment when imported from Nepal.\n5. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States (the \"HTS\") (19 U.S.C. 1202) the substance of the relevant provisions of the Trade Act and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.\n6. In order to implement the duty-free treatment provided in accordance with the provisions of the TFTEA, it is necessary to modify the HTS, thus incorporating the substance of relevant provisions of the TFTEA, and of actions taken thereunder, into the HTS, pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act.\n7. In Proclamation 7748 of December 30, 2003, President Bush determined that the Central African Republic was not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (the \"AGOA\"). Thus, pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)), President Bush terminated the designation of the Central African Republic as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act. 8. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a \"beneficiary sub-Saharan African country\" if the President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).\n9. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act, based on actions that the Central African Republic has taken, I have determined that the Central African Republic meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA and the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act, and I have decided to designate the Central African Republic as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.\n10. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (the \"USIFTA\"), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the \"USIFTA Act\") (19 U.S.C. 2112 note).\n11. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.\n12. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the \"2004 US-Israel Agreement\").\n13. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 US-Israel Agreement, President Bush determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.\n14. Each year from 2008 through 2015, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 US-Israel Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 US-Israel Agreement.\n15. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010; Proclamation 8770 of December 29, 2011; Proclamation 8921 of December 20, 2012; Proclamation 9072 of December 23, 2013; Proclamation 9223 of December 23, 2014; and Proclamation 9383 of December 21, 2015, modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period.\n16. On December 5, 2016, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 US-Israel Agreement is in force through December 31, 2017,\nand to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 US-Israel Agreement.\n17. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2017, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.\n18. Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the \"1988 Act\") (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005) if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Convention) and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States. In 2006 and 2011, the Commission recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to section 1205 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to amendments made to the Convention. In Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, and Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, President Bush and I, respectively, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to the amendments to the Convention.\n19. Proclamation 8332 of December 29, 2008, implemented the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (the \"USOFTA\") with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the \"USOFTA Act\") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that President Bush determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2.8, and 3.2.9, and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to Oman set forth in Annex 2-B of the USOFTA.\n20. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods from Oman in categories that were modified to conform to the Convention, President Bush and I proclaimed in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771, respectively, modifications to the HTS that we determined were necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8332.\n21. The United States and Oman are parties to the Convention. Because the substance of changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in the national tariff schedules of the United States and Oman, the rules of origin set out in Annex 3-A and Annex 4-A of the USOFTA must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USOFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771. The United States and Oman have agreed to make these changes.\n22. Section 202 of the USOFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note) provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing preferential tariff treatment under the USOFTA. Section 202(j) of the USOFTA Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USOFTA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the USOFTA, subject to the exceptions stated in section 202(j)(2)(A) of the USOFTA Act.\n23. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 202 of the USOFTA Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8332.\n24. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), as amended, provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register.\n25. Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012, implemented the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the \"USPTPA\") with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the \"USPTPA Act\") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.26, 3.27, 3.28, and 3.29, and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to Panama set forth in Annex 3.3 of the USPTPA.\n26. The United States and Panama are parties to the Convention. Because changes to the Convention are reflected in slight differences of form between the national tariff schedules of the United States and Panama, the rules of origin set out in Annex 4.1 of the USPTPA must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USPTPA Act to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were proclaimed in Proclamation 8894. The United States and Panama have agreed to make these changes.\n27. Section 202 of the USPTPA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note) provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USPTPA. Section 202(o) of the USPTPA Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USPTPA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the USPTPA, subject to the exceptions stated in section 202(o) of the USPTPA Act.\n28. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 202 of the USPTPA Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8894.\n29. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register.\n30. Proclamation 7987 of February 28, 2006, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the \"CAFTA-DR\") with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the \"CAFTA-DR Act\") (19 U.S.C. 4031), the staged reductions in duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 3.28 of the CAFTA-DR.\n31. The United States, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the \"CAFTA-DR countries\") are parties to the Convention. Because changes to the Convention are reflected in slight differences of form between the national tariff schedules of the United States and the other CAFTA-DR countries, Annexes 4.1, 3.25, and 3.29 of the CAFTA-DR must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the CAFTA-DR to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were proclaimed in Proclamation 7987. The United States and the other CAFTA-DR countries have agreed to make these changes.\n32. Section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 3.28 of the CAFTA-DR.\n33. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 7987.\n34. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 915 of the TFTEA (19 U.S.C. 4454), section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)); section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 2112 note); section 301 of title 3, United States Code; section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)); section 202 of the USOFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note); section 202 of the USPTPA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note); section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4031); and section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do proclaim that:\n(1) In order to provide for the preferential treatment provided for in section 915 of the TFTEA, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this proclamation. The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex I shall continue in effect through December 31, 2025.\n(2) The Central African Republic is designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.\n(3) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) and U.S. note 1 to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 to the HTS are each modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries \"Central African Republic.\" Further, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries \"Central African Republic.\"\n(4) In order to implement U.S. tariff commitments under the 2004 US-Israel Agreement through December 31, 2017, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex II to this proclamation.\n(5) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex II to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to eligible agricultural products of Israel that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2017.\n(6) The provisions of subchapter VII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as modified by Annex II to this proclamation, shall continue in effect through December 31, 2017.\n(7) In order to reflect in the HTS the modifications to the rules of origin under the USOFTA, general note 31 to the HTS is modified as provided in Annex III to this proclamation.\n(8) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS set forth in Annex III to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the later of (i) February 1, 2017, or (ii) the thirtieth day after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.\n(9) In order to provide generally for the modifications in the rules for determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under Annex 4.1 of the USPTPA, to provide preferential tariff treatment for certain other goods under the USPTPA, and to make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation.\n(10) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph (9) of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the date, as announced by the United States Trade Representative in the Federal Register, that the conditions set forth in the Agreement have been fulfilled, and shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after that date.\n(11) In order to provide generally for the modifications in the rules for determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the CAFTA-DR, to provide preferential tariff treatment for certain other goods under the CAFTA-DR, and to make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex V to this proclamation.\n(12) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph (11) of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the date, as announced by the United States Trade Representative in the Federal Register, that the applicable conditions set forth in the CAFTA-DR have been fulfilled, and shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after that date.\n(13) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-15", "title": "Proclamation 9555—To Implement the Nepal Preference Program and for Other Purposes"}

RBC is a broad concept based on the idea that businesses can perform well while doing good and that governments should set and facilitate the conditions for this to take place. Following a thorough process that prioritized consultations with stakeholders from around the country, as well as coordination among more than a dozen federal agencies, the United States government (USG) has published its first National Action Plan (NAP) on Responsible Business Conduct. The U.S. NAP provides a framework by which the USG intends to increase its commitment to coordinate and promote RBC work with partners in the private sector, as well as other stakeholders.\nOver the past eight years, the Administration has taken a number of steps to promote fair play, the rule of law, and high standards for global commerce. Moreover, U.S. companies are recognized as global leaders in acting responsibly in the communities in which they do business.\nThe U.S. NAP presents the many ways in which the USG, in partnership with business, labor, foreign governments, and other stakeholders, supports open and accountable business practices that demonstrate principled governance, respect for human rights, and a commitment to transparency. It underscores the ways U.S. companies can promote positive change within the communities in which they operate, which bolsters the American brand. The U.S. NAP also features new initiatives that build on this strong foundation, and outlines how the USG, businesses, and other stakeholders can strengthen efforts to promote high standards.\nKey Features\nThis NAP is based on domestic and international best practices, including those found in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD Guidelines) and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles). These best practices provide the basis for how governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders can work together to set and attain high standards of RBC.\nThe NAP is divided into five categories. Each category highlights ongoing initiatives while also including new actions that the USG intends to undertake. In short, the USG intends to: (1) continue to refine the ways in which the USG purchases and finances responsibly; (2) work with companies, civil society, and foreign governments to share best practices and support high standards; (3); highlight the success stories of leading companies; and (4) seek to provide effective mechanisms to address negative impacts when they occur.\nLeading by Example\nThrough our laws, policies, and international commitments, as well as through the purchasing of goods and services, the USG promotes high RBC standards. The NAP discusses a number of ways in which the USG leads by example, including:\n•      Strengthening laws preventing the import of goods produced by forced labor to ensure products made under exploitative conditions do not gain U.S. market access.\n•      Updating social and environmental standards criteria for financing through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, to promote high standards through U.S.-supported private investment.\n•      Creating guidance on social safeguards for USAID's development programs.\n•      Funding efforts to promote awareness and implementation of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n•      Publishing, for the first time, an annual report by the U.S. National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines.\n•      Identifying means through trade agreements to encourage companies to engage in RBC.\n•      Enhancing information sharing with sub-national governments on public procurement best practices, to ensure that governments at all levels promote RBC through purchasing.\nCollaboration with Stakeholders\nIn order to achieve shared RBC goals, it is essential for governments to work with the private sector, as well as with civil society, labor, and other stakeholders, to leverage each other's resources and strengths. The USG's measures to collaborate with such stakeholders include:\n•      Establishing a formal mechanism for increased government participation in \"multi-stakeholder initiatives\" that promote RBC in various sectors and regions.\n•      Convening stakeholders to develop and promote effective metrics for measuring and managing labor rights impacts in supply chains.\n•      Facilitating a dialogue with stakeholders on implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n•      Promoting worker voice and empowerment in global supply chains via new tools that allow workers in national supply chains to directly report potential labor abuses and workplace safety violations, as well as leveraging public-private partnerships to more fully incorporate the perspectives of workers.\nFacilitating RBC by Companies\nThe USG encourages companies to follow the best domestic and international practices and is supportive of company efforts to voluntarily report on certain aspects of their operations. The USG produces a number of reports that can be useful for companies as they seek to uphold high standards, sometimes in challenging environments. The NAP sets forth an illustrative list of USG initiatives to further that work, including the following commitments:\n•      Creating an online database containing government reports on issues such as human rights, human trafficking including forced labor, child labor, and investment climates so that companies can more effectively make investment decisions and mitigate risk.\n•      Providing new and increased training for USG officers and officials, including those who serve abroad, on RBC issues so that government officials are well-equipped to advise companies on considerations such as the status of labor rights, human rights and transparency, in a particular operating environment.\n•      Training for USG officials on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related issues.\n•      Updating country-level public land governance profiles that explain land laws, land use patterns, gender concerns, land administration, and land markets within a given country. These profiles are an important tool for businesses making responsible land-based investments in a given country.\nRecognizing Positive Performance\nU.S. companies make tremendous contributions to communities around the world by generating economic growth, creating jobs, spurring innovation, and providing solutions to pressing challenges such as access to clean energy, healthcare, and technology. The USG recognizes and highlights when companies achieve high standards with meaningful results for workers and communities. Such examples of recognition include:\n•      Modernizing the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence to include thematic categories that more closely reflect international best practices on RBC and that align with the State Department's interest in promoting high standards globally. The award is now in its seventeenth year and is awarded annually to U.S. companies.\n•      Developing an online mechanism to identify, document, and publicize lessons learned and best practices related to corporate actions that promote and respect human rights.\nProviding Access to Remedy\nEven when governments and companies seek to act responsibly, challenges can arise. Both governments and companies should have mechanisms in place by which affected parties can raise concerns, report problems, and seek remedies, as appropriate. Through the NAP, the USG is furthering its commitment to this objective by:\n•      Improving the performance of the U.S. National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, including by announcing a fall 2017 peer review, organizing workshops to promote RBC, and publishing an outreach plan.\n•      Hosting a forum for dialogue with stakeholders on opportunities and challenges regarding issues of remedy, as well as how the USG can best support effective remedy processes.\nThe full text of the National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct can be found here.

Good afternoon. This is the most wonderful press conference of the year. [Laughter] I've got a list of who's been naughty and nice to call on. [Laughter] But let me first make a couple of quick points, and then I'll take your questions.\nTypically, I use this yearend press conference to review how far we've come over the course of the year. Today, understandably, I'm going to talk a little bit about how far we've come over the past 8 years.\nAs I was preparing to take office, the unemployment rate was on its way to 10 percent. Today, it's at 4.6 percent, the lowest in nearly a decade. We've seen the longest streak of job growth on record, and wages have grown faster over the past few years than at any time in the past 40.\nWhen I came into office, 44 million people were uninsured. Today, we've covered more than 20 million of them. For the first time in our history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured. In fact, yesterday was the biggest day ever for healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get covered, and more are signing up by the day.\nWe've cut our dependence on foreign oil by more than half, doubled production of renewable energy, enacted the most sweeping reforms since FDR to protect consumers and prevent a crisis on Wall Street from punishing Main Street ever again. None of these actions stifled growth, as critics predicted. Instead, the stock market has nearly tripled. Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs. And the economy is undoubtedly more durable than it was in the days when we relied on oil from unstable nations and banks took risky bets with your money.\nAdd it all up, and last year, the poverty rate fell at the fastest rate in almost 50 years, while the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record. In fact, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by nearly two-thirds and protecting vital investments that grow the middle class.\nIn foreign policy, when I came into office, we were in the midst of two wars. Now, nearly 180,000 troops are down to 15,000. Bin Laden, rather than being at large, has been taken off the battlefield, along with thousands of other terrorists. Over the past 8 years, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully executed an attack on our homeland that was directed from overseas.\nThrough diplomacy, we've ensured that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon, without going to war with Iran. We opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba. And we brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could very well save this planet for our kids. And almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did 8 years ago.\nIn other words, by so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started. It's a situation that I'm proud to leave for my successor. And it's thanks to the American people: to the hard work that you've put in, the sacrifices you've made for your families and your communities, the businesses that you started or invested in, the way you looked out for one another. And I could not be prouder to be your President.\nOf course, to tout this progress doesn't mean that we're not mindful of how much more there is to do. In this season in particular, we're reminded that there are people who are still hungry, people who are still homeless, people who still have trouble paying the bills or finding work after being laid off. There are communities that are still mourning those who have been stolen from us by senseless gun violence and parents who still are wondering how to protect their kids. And after I leave office, I intend to continue to work with organizations and citizens doing good across the country on these and other pressing issues to build on the progress that we've made.\nAround the world, as well, there are hotspots where disputes have been intractable, conflicts have flared up, and people—innocent people—are suffering as a result. And nowhere is this more terribly true than in the city of Aleppo. For years, we've worked to stop the civil war in Syria and alleviate human suffering. It has been one of the hardest issues that I've faced as President.\nThe world, as we speak, is united in horror at the savage assaults by the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies on the city of Aleppo. We have seen a deliberate strategy of surrounding, besieging, and starving innocent civilians. We've seen relentless targeting of humanitarian workers and medical personnel; entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble and dust. There are continuing reports of civilians being executed. And these are all horrific violations of international law. Responsibility for this brutality lies in one place alone: with the Asad regime and its allies Russia and Iran. And this blood and these atrocities are on their hands.\nWe all know what needs to happen. There needs to be an impartial international observer force in Aleppo that can help coordinate an orderly evacuation through safe corridors. There has to be full access for humanitarian aid, even as the United States continues to be the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. And beyond that, there needs to be a broader cease-fire that can serve as the basis for a political rather than a military solution. That's what the United States is going to continue to push for, both with our partners and through multilateral institutions like the U.N.\nAnd regretfully, but unsurprisingly, Russia has repeatedly blocked the Security Council from taking action on these issues. So we're going to keep pressing the Security Council to help improve the delivery of humanitarian aid to those who are in such desperate need, and to ensure accountability, including continuing to monitor any potential use of chemical weapons in Syria. And we're going to work in the U.N. General Assembly as well, both on accountability and to advance a political settlement. Because it should be clear that although you may achieve tactical victories, over the long term, the Asad regime cannot slaughter its way to legitimacy.\nThat's why we'll continue to press for a transition to a more representative government. And that's why the world must not avert our eyes to the terrible events that are unfolding. The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies are trying to obfuscate the truth. The world should not be fooled. And the world will not forget.\nSo even in a season where the incredible blessings that we know as Americans are all around us, even as we enjoy family and friends and are reminded of how lucky we are, we should also be reminded that to be an American involves bearing burdens and meeting obligations to others. American values and American ideals are what will lead the way to a safer and more prosperous 2017, both here and abroad.\nAnd by the way, few embody those values and ideals like our brave men and women in uniform and their families. So I just want to close by wishing all of them a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.\nWith that, I will take some questions. And I'm going to start with Josh Lederman of AP.\n2016 Presidential Election/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/Russia/Democratic National Committee/Cybersecurity\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. There's a perception that you're letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election and that a response that nobody knows about or a look-back review just don't cut it. Are you prepared to call out President Putin by name for ordering this hacking? And do you agree with what Hillary Clinton now says, that the hacking was actually partially responsible for her loss? And is your administration's open quarreling with Trump and his team on this issue tarnishing the smooth transition of power that you have promised?\nThe President. Well, first of all, with respect to the transition, I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful as I promised. And that will continue. And it's just been a few days since I last talked to the President-elect about a whole range of transition issues. That cooperation is going to continue.\nThere hasn't been a lot of squabbling. What we've simply said is the facts, which are that, based on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and that, as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference through cyber attacks in the future.\nThat should be a bipartisan issue; that shouldn't be a partisan issue. And my hope is that the President-elect is going to similarly be concerned with making sure that we don't have potential foreign influence in our election process. I don't think any American wants that. And that shouldn't be a source of an argument.\nI think that part of the challenge is that it gets caught up in the carryover from election season. And I think it is very important for us to distinguish between the politics of the election and the need for us, as a country, both from a national security perspective, but also in terms of the integrity of our election system and our democracy, to make sure that we don't create a political football here.\nNow, with respect to how this thing unfolded last year, let's just go through the facts pretty quickly. At the beginning of the summer, we're alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it, investigate it thoroughly, to brief the potential victims of this hacking, to brief on a bipartisan basis the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the relevant intelligence committees. And once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact, had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russia had hacked into the DNC.\nAnd at that time, we did not attribute motives or any interpretations of why they had done so. We didn't discuss what the effects of it might be. We simply let people know—the public know, just as we had let Members of Congress know—that this had happened. And as a consequence, all of you wrote a lot of stories about both what had happened, and then you interpreted why that might have happened and what effect it was going to have on the election outcomes. We did not. And the reason we did not was because in this hyperpartisan atmosphere, at a time when my primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens, I wanted to make sure that everybody understood we were playing this thing straight, that we weren't trying to advantage one side or another, but what we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place, and so if you started seeing effects on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account.\nAnd that's exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place; at a time, by the way, when the President-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.\nAnd finally, I think it's worth pointing out that the information was already out. It was in the hands of WikiLeaks, so that was going to come out no matter what. What I was concerned about, in particular, was making sure that that wasn't compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself.\nAnd so in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn't. And in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred.\nSo when I look back in terms of how we handled it, I think we handled it the way it should have been handled. We allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence. We briefed all relevant parties involved in terms of what was taking place. When we had a consensus around what had happened, we announced it, not through the White House, not through me, but rather through the intelligence communities that had actually carried out these investigations. And then, we allowed you and the American public to make an assessment as to how to weigh that going into the election.\nAnd the truth is, is that there was nobody here who didn't have some sense of what kind of effect it might have. I'm finding it a little curious that everybody is suddenly acting surprised that this looked like it was disadvantaging Hillary Clinton, because you guys wrote about it every day. [Laughter] Every single leak. About every little juicy tidbit of political gossip, including John Podesta's risotto recipe. [Laughter] This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage.\nSo I do think it's worth us reflecting how it is that a Presidential election of such importance, of such moment, with so many big issues at stake, and such a contrast between the candidates, came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. What is it about our political system that made us vulnerable to these kinds of potential manipulations, which, as I've said publicly before, were not particularly sophisticated. This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic Party e-mails that contained pretty routine stuff, some of it embarrassing or uncomfortable, because I suspect that if any of us got our e-mails hacked into, there might be some things that we wouldn't want suddenly appearing on the front page of a newspaper or a telecast, even if there wasn't anything particularly illegal or controversial about it. And then, it just took off.\nAnd that concerns me. And it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is, is that everybody had the information. It was out there. And we handled it the way we should have.\nNow, moving forward, I think there are a couple of issues that this raises. Number one is just the constant challenge that we are going to have with cybersecurity throughout our economy and throughout our society. We are a digitalized culture, and there is hacking going on every single day. There's not a company, there's not a major organization, there's not a financial institution, there's not a branch of our Government where somebody is not going to be phishing for something or trying to penetrate or put in a virus or malware. And this is why for the last 8 years, I've been obsessed with how do we continually upgrade our cybersecurity systems.\nAnd this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cyber issues being used in ways that can affect our infrastructure, affect the stability of our financial systems, and affect the integrity of our institutions, like our election process.\nI just received a couple weeks back—it wasn't widely reported on—a report from our cybersecurity Commission that outlines a whole range of strategies to do a better job on this. But it's difficult, because it's not all housed—the target of cyber attacks is not one entity, but it's widely dispersed, and a lot of it is private, like the DNC. It's not a branch of government. We can't tell people what to do. What we can do is inform them, get best practices.\nWhat we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other countries against these kinds of attacks. And we've done that in the past. So just as I told Russia to stop it and indicated there will be consequences when they do it, the Chinese have, in the past, engaged in cyber attacks directed at our companies to steal trade secrets and proprietary technology. And I had to have the same conversation with Prime Minister—or with President Xi, and what we've seen is some evidence that they have reduced, but not completely eliminated, these activities, partly because they can use cutouts.\nOne of the problems with the Internet and cyber issues is that there's not always a return address, and by the time you catch up to it, attributing what happened to a particular Government can be difficult, not always provable in court even though our intelligence communities can make an assessment.\nWhat we've also tried to do is to start creating some international norms about this to prevent some sort of cyber arms race, because we obviously have offensive capabilities as well as defensive capabilities. And my approach is not a situation in which everybody is worse off because folks are constantly attacking each other back and forth, but putting some guardrails around the behavior of nation-states, including our adversaries, just so that they understand that whatever they do to us we can potentially do to them.\nWe do have some special challenges, because oftentimes, our economy is more digitalized, it is more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than some of these other countries. And we have a more open society and engage in less control and censorship over what happens over the Internet, which is also part of what makes us special.\nLast point—and the reason I'm going on here is because I know that you guys have a lot of questions about this, and I haven't addressed all of you directly about it—with respect to response, my principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnished, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that somehow tampering had taken place with the actual process of voting. And we accomplished that.\nThat does not mean that we are not going to respond. It simply meant that we had a set of priorities leading up to the election that were of the utmost importance. Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you.\nBut it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. And I know that there have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians. But keep in mind that we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians. The relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years. And so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us, is something that's worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that's exactly what we've done.\nSo at a point in time where we've taken certain actions that we can divulge publicly, we will do so. There are times where the message will go—will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized. And I should point out, by the way, part of why the Russians have been effective on this is because they don't go around announcing what they're doing. It's not like Putin is going around the world publicly saying, look what we did, wasn't that clever? He denies it. So the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective, I think, doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.\nOkay?\n2016 Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton/Democratic Party\nQ. Did Clinton lose because of the hacking?\nThe President. I'm going to let all the political pundits in this town have a long discussion about what happened in the election. It was a fascinating election, so I'm sure there are going to be a lot of books written about it.\nI've said what I think is important for the Democratic Party going forward rather than try to parse every aspect of the election. And I've said before, I couldn't be prouder of Secretary Clinton, her outstanding service. I think she's worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people, and I don't think she was treated fairly during the election. I think the coverage of her and the issues was troubling.\nBut having said that, what I've been most focused on—appropriate for the fact that I'm not going to be a politician in about, what is it, 32 days? 31?\nQ. Thirty-four. The President. Thirty four? [Laughter] But what I've said is, is that I can maybe give some counsel and advice to the Democratic Party. And I think that the thing we have to spend the most time on—because it's the thing we have the most control over—is, how do we make sure that we are showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed, where they are helping, where they are making a difference, but where people feel as if they're not being heard and where Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, politically correct, out-of-touch folks? We have to be in those communities. And I've seen that when we are in those communities, it makes a difference.\nThat's how I became President. I became a U.S. Senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving around downstate Illinois and going to fish fries and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers. And I didn't win every one of their votes, but they got a sense of what I was talking about, what I cared about, that I was for working people, that I was for the middle class, that the reason I was interested in strengthening unions and raising the minimum wage and rebuilding our infrastructure and making sure that parents had decent childcare and family leave was because my own family's history wasn't that different from theirs, even if I looked a little bit different. Same thing in Iowa.\nAnd so the question is, how do we rebuild that party as a whole so that there's not a county in any State—I don't care how red—where we don't have a presence and we're not making the argument. Because I think we have the better argument. But that requires a lot of work. It's been something that I've been able to do successfully in my own campaigns. It is not something I've been able to transfer to candidates in midterms and sort of build a sustaining organization around. That's something that I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're also dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House.\nAnd that doesn't mean, though, that it can't be done. And I think there are going to be a lot of talented folks out there, a lot of progressives who share my values who are going to be leading the charge in the years to come.\nMichelle Kosinski of CNN.\nThe President's Communications With President-Elect Donald J. Trump/Federal Bureau of Investigation\nQ. Thank you. So this week we heard Hillary Clinton talk about how she thinks that the FBI Director's most recent announcement made a difference in the outcome of the election. And we also just heard in an op-ed her campaign chairman talk about something being deeply broken within the FBI. He talked about thinking that the investigation early on was lackadaisical in his words. So what do you think about those comments? Do you think there's any truth to them? Do you think there's a danger there that they're calling into question the integrity of institutions in a similar way that Donald Trump's team has done?\nAnd a second part to that is that Donald Trump's team repeatedly—I guess, giving the indication that the investigation of the Russian hack, as well as the retaliation, might not be such a priority once he's in office, so what do you think the risk is there? And are you going to talk to him directly about some of those comments he made?\nThe President. Well, on the latter point, as I said before, the transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. It's bumpy. There are still feelings that are raw out there. There are people who are still thinking about how things unfolded. And I get all that. But when Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn as the 45th President of the United States, then he's got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. And I've said this before: I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office. And I haven't shared previously private conversations I've had with the President-elect. I will say that they have been cordial and, in some cases, have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to ensure that regardless of our obvious deep disagreements about policy, maybe I can transmit some thoughts about maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can't say that he will end up implementing, but the conversations themselves have been cordial as opposed to defensive in any way. And I will always make myself available to him, just as previous Presidents have made themselves available to me as issues come up.\nWith respect to the FBI, I will tell you, I've had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents, I know Director Comey. They take their job seriously, they work really hard, they help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. And it is always a challenge for law enforcement when there's an intersection between the work that they are doing and the political system. It's one of the difficulties of democracy, generally. We have a system where we want our law enforcement investigators and our prosecutors to be free from politics, to be independent, to play it straight, but sometimes, that involves investigations that touch on politics. And particularly in this hyperpartisan environment that we've been in, everything is suspect, everything you do one way or the other.\nOne thing that I have done is to be pretty scrupulous about not wading into investigation decisions or prosecution decisions or decisions not to prosecute. I have tried to be really strict in my own behavior about preserving the independence of law enforcement, free from my own judgments and political assessments, in some cases. And I don't know why I would stop now.\nMike Dorning of Bloomberg. There you are.\nThe President's Sense of Personal Responsibility for Addressing International Crises/Syria\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. On Aleppo, your views that what happens there is the responsibility of the Russian Government, the Iranian Government, the Asad regime have been pretty well aired. But do you, as President of the United States, leader of the free world, feel any personal, moral responsibility now at the end of your Presidency for the carnage that we're all watching in Aleppo, which I'm sure disturbs you, which you said disturbs you?\nSecondly, also on Aleppo, you've again made clear your practical disagreements with the idea of safe zones. And President-elect Trump has, throughout his campaign—and he said again last night—that he wants to create safe zones in Syria. Do you feel like, in this transition, you need to help him toward implementing that? Or was that not something that you should be doing?\nThe President. Good. Mike, I always feel responsible. I've felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and slaughter that's taken place in South Sudan that's not being reported on partly because there's not as much social media being generated from there.\nThere are places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office, because I'm President of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn't deserve to suffer. So that's a starting point. There's not a moment during the course of this Presidency where I haven't felt some responsibility. That's true, by the way, for our own country. When I came into office and people were losing their jobs and losing their homes and losing their pensions, I felt responsible, and I would go home at night, and I would ask myself, was there something better that I could do or smarter that I could be that would make a difference in their lives, that would relieve their suffering and relieve their hardship?\nSo, with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States.\nAnd throughout this process, based on hours of meetings—if you tallied it up, days or weeks of meetings where we went through every option in painful detail, with maps, and we had our military, and we had our aid agencies, and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours—whenever we went through it, the challenge was that, short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, and when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough to necessarily govern a country, and you had a military superpower in Russia prepared to do whatever it took to keep its client state involved, and you had a regional military power in Iran that saw their own vital strategic interests at stake and were willing to send in as many of their people or proxies to support the regime—that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems, and that everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap.\nAnd in that circumstance, I have to make a decision as President of the United States as to what is best——\n[At this point, a reporter attending the news conference fainted.]\nThe President. I'm sorry, what's going on?\nQ. Somebody passed out.\nThe President. Somebody's not feeling good? All right. Why don't we have—we've got—we can get our doctors back there to help out. Does somebody want to go to my doctor's office and just have them—all right—where was I?\nQ. Doing it on the cheap.\nThe President. So we couldn't do it on the cheap. Now, it may be——\nQ. We need to get a doctor in here, I think. Can that be arranged? Thank you.\nThe President. Can somebody help out please and get Doc Jackson in here? Is somebody grabbing our doctor?\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President, for stopping.\nThe President. Of course. In the meantime, just give her a little room. The doctor will be here in a second. You guys know where the doctor's office is? Just go through the Palm doors. It's right next to the Map Room. There he is. All right, there's Doc Jackson. He's all right. Okay. The doctor is in the house. Q. You were saying you can't do it on the cheap.\nThe President. So—and I don't mean that—I mean that with all sincerity. I understand the impulse to want to do something. But ultimately, what I've had to do is to think about what can we sustain, what is realistic. And my first priority has to be, what's the right thing to do for America?\nAnd it has been our view that the best thing to do has been to provide some support to the moderate opposition so that they could sustain themselves, and that we wouldn't see anti-Asad regime sentiments just pouring into al-Nusra and Al Qaida or ISIL; that we engaged our international partners in order to put pressure on all the parties involved, and to try to resolve this through diplomatic and political means.\nI cannot claim that we've been successful. And so that's something that, as is true with a lot of issues and problems around the world, I have to go to bed with every night. But I continue to believe that it was the right approach, given what realistically we could get done absent a decision, as I said, to go in a much more significant way. And that, I think, would not have been sustainable or good for the American people because we had a whole host of other obligations that we also had to meet, wars we had already started and that were not yet finished.\nWith respect to the issue of safe zones, it is a continued problem. A continued challenge with safe zones is, if you're setting up those zones on Syrian territory, then that requires some force that is willing to maintain that territory in the absence of consent from the Syrian Government and, now, the Russians or the Iranians. So it may be that with Aleppo's tragic situation unfolding, that in the short term, if we can get more of the tens of thousands who are still trapped there out, that so long as the world's eyes are on them and they are feeling pressure, the regime and Russia concludes that they are willing to find some arrangement, perhaps in coordination with Turkey, whereby those people can be safe. Even that will probably be temporary, but at least it solves a short-term issue that's going to arise.\nUnfortunately, we're not even there yet, because right now we have Russians and Asad claiming that basically all the innocent civilians who were trapped in Aleppo are out when international organizations, humanitarian organizations who know better and who are on the ground have said unequivocally that there are still tens of thousands who are trapped and prepared to leave under pretty much any conditions. And so right now our biggest priority is to continue to put pressure wherever we can to try to get them out.\nQ. But notwithstanding——\nThe President. Well, Mike, I can't have too much——\nQ. On the second question, your objections are well aired, but do you feel responsibility notwithstanding a move in that direction or help President-elect Trump move in that direction?\nThe President. I will help President Trump—President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he's sworn in, can make a decision. Between now and then, these are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations I have with our military and the people who have been working this every single day.\nPeter Alexander [NBC News]. 2016 Presidential Election/Russia/Republican Party/President-Elect Donald J. Trump's Cabinet Nominations\nQ. Mr. President, thank you very much. Can you, given all the intelligence that we have now heard, assure the public that this was, once and for all, a free and fair election? And specifically on Russia, do you feel any obligation now, as they've been insisting that this isn't the case, to show the proof, as it were? They say, put your money where your mouth is and declassify some of the intelligence, some of the evidence that exists. And more broadly, as it relates to Donald Trump on this very topic, are you concerned about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, especially given some of the recent Cabinet picks, including his selection for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who toasted Putin with champagne over oil deals together? Thank you.\nThe President. Okay. I may be getting older, because these multipart questions, I start losing track. [Laughter]\nQ. Free and fair.\nThe President. I can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was of concern and will continue to be of concern going forward; that the votes that were cast were counted, they were counted appropriately. We have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with. So that assurance I can provide.\nThat doesn't mean that we find every single potential probe of every single voting machine all across the country, but we paid a lot of attention to it. We worked with State officials, et cetera, and we feel confident that that didn't occur and that the votes were cast and they were counted.\nAnd so that's on that point. What was the second one?\nQ. The second one was about declassification.\nThe President. Declassification. Look, we will provide evidence that we can safely provide that does not compromise sources and methods. But I'll be honest with you, when you're talking about cybersecurity, a lot of it is classified. And we're not going to provide it because the way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know, and if we're going to monitor this stuff effectively going forward, we don't want them to know that we know.\nSo this is one of those situations where unless the American people genuinely think that the professionals in the CIA, the FBI, our entire intelligence infrastructure—many of whom, by the way, served in previous administrations and who are Republicans—are less trustworthy than the Russians, then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say.\nThis is part of what I meant when I said that we've got to think about what's happening to our political culture here. The Russians can't change us or significantly weaken us. They are a smaller country. They are a weaker country. Their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms. They don't innovate.\nBut they can impact us if we lose track of who we are. They can impact us if we abandon our values. Mr. Putin can weaken us, just like he's trying to weaken Europe, if we start buying into notions that it's okay to intimidate the press or lock up dissidents or discriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like. And what I worry about more than anything is the degree to which, because of the fierceness of the partisan battle, you started to see certain folks in the Republican Party and Republican voters suddenly finding a Government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for as being okay because that's how much we dislike Democrats.\nI mean, think about it. Some of the people who historically have been very critical of me for engaging with the Russians and having conversations with them also endorsed the President-elect, even as he was saying that we should stop sanctioning Russia and being tough on them and work together with them against our common enemies. He was very complimentary of Mr. Putin personally.\nThat wasn't news. The President-elect during the campaign said so. And some folks who had made a career out of being anti-Russian didn't say anything about it. And then, after the election, suddenly, they're asking, well, why didn't you tell us that maybe the Russians were trying to help our candidate? Well, come on. There was a survey, some of you saw, where—now, this is just one poll, but a pretty credible source—37 percent of Republican voters approve of Putin. Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.\nAnd how did that happen? It happened in part because, for too long, everything that happens in this town, everything that's said is seen through the lens of \"does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats or relative to President Obama?\" And unless that changes, we're going to continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence, because we've lost track of what it is that we're about and what we stand for.\nWith respect to the President-elect's appointments, it is his prerogative, as I've always said, for him to appoint who he thinks can best carry out his foreign policy or his domestic policy. It is up to the Senate to advise and consent. There will be plenty of time for Members of the Senate to go through the record of all his appointees and determine whether or not they're appropriate for the job.\nMartha Raddatz [ABC News].\n2016 Presidential Election/Russia/Democratic National Committee/Cybersecurity\nQ. Mr. President, I want to talk about Vladimir Putin again. Just to be clear, do you believe Vladimir Putin himself authorized the hack? And do you believe he authorized that to help Donald Trump? And on the intelligence, one of the things Donald Trump cites is Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction, and that they were never found. Can you say, unequivocally, that this was not China, that this was not a 400-pound guy sitting on his bed, as Donald Trump says? And do these types of tweets and kinds of statements from Donald Trump embolden the Russians?\nThe President. When the report comes out, before I leave office, that will have drawn together all the threads. And so I don't want to step on their work ahead of time.\nWhat I can tell you is that the intelligence that I have seen gives me great confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack.\nQ. Which hack?\nThe President. The hack of the DNC and the hack of John Podesta.\nNow, the—but again, I think this is exactly why I want the report out so that everybody can review it. And this has been briefed, and the evidence in closed session has been provided on a bipartisan basis—not just to me, it's been provided to the leaders of the House and the Senate and the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant committees. And I think that what you've already seen is, at least some of the folks who have seen the evidence don't dispute, I think, the basic assessment that the Russians carried this out.\nQ. But specifically, can you not say that——\nThe President. Well, Martha, I think what I want to make sure of is that I give the intelligence community the chance to gather all the information. But I'd make a larger point, which is, not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. I mean, this is a pretty hierarchical operation. Last I checked, there's not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation, particularly when it comes to policies directed at the United States.\nWe have said, and I will confirm, that this happened at the highest levels of the Russian Government. And I will let you make that determination as to whether there are high-level Russian officials who go off rogue and decide to tamper with the U.S. election process without Vladimir Putin knowing about it.\nQ. So I wouldn't be wrong in saying the President thinks Vladimir Putin authorized the hack?\nThe President. Martha, I've given you what I'm going to give you.\nWhat was your second question? [Laughter]\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/Foreign Influence in U.S. Elections\nQ. Do the tweets and do the statements by Donald Trump embolden Russia?\nThe President. Got it. As I said before, I think that the President-elect is still in transition mode from campaign to governance. I think he hasn't gotten his whole team together yet. He still has campaign spokespersons, sort of, filling in and appearing on cable shows. And there's just a whole different attitude and vibe when you're not in power as when you're in power.\nSo rather than me, sort of, characterize the appropriateness or inappropriateness of what he's doing at the moment, I think what we have to see is how will the President-elect operate and how will his team operate when they've been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of Government, and they've got to start making decisions.\nOne way I do believe that the President-elect can approach this that would be unifying is to say that we welcome a bipartisan, independent process that gives the American people an assurance not only that votes are counted properly, that the elections are fair and free, but that we have learned lessons about how Internet propaganda from foreign countries can be released into the political bloodstream and that we've got strategies to deal with it for the future.\nThe more this can be nonpartisan, the better served the American people are going to be, which is why I made the point earlier, and I'm going to keep on repeating this point: Our vulnerability to Russia or any other foreign power is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. That's the thing that makes us vulnerable.\nIf fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn't seem that far fetched compared to some of the other stuff that folks are hearing from domestic propagandists. To the extent that our political dialogue is such where everything is under suspicion, everybody is corrupt, and everybody is doing things for partisan reasons and all of our institutions are full of malevolent actors—if that's the storyline that's being put out there by whatever party is out of power, then when a foreign government introduces that same argument with facts that are made up, voters who have been listening to that stuff for years, who have been getting that stuff every day from talk radio or other venues, they're going to believe it.\nSo if we want to really reduce foreign influence on our elections, then we'd better think about how to make sure that our political process, our political dialogue is stronger than it's been.\nMark Landler [New York Times].\nU.S. Foreign Policy/China-U.S. Relations/President-Elect Donald J. Trump\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I wonder whether I could move you from Russia to China for a moment.\nThe President. Absolutely. [Laughter]\nQ. Your successor spoke by phone with the President of Taiwan the other day and declared subsequently that he wasn't sure why the United States needed to be bound by the one-China policy. He suggested it could be used as a bargaining chip perhaps to get better terms on a trade deal or more cooperation on North Korea. There's already evidence that tensions between the two sides have increased a bit, and just today, the Chinese have evidently seized an underwater drone in the South China Sea. Do you agree, as some do, that our China policy could use a fresh set of eyes? And what's the big deal about having a short phone call with the President of Taiwan? Or do you worry that these types of unorthodox approaches are setting us on a collision course with perhaps our biggest geopolitical adversary?\nThe President. Well, that's a great question. I'm somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I think one of the—I've said this before—I am very proud of the work I've done. I think I'm a better President now than when I started. But if you're here for 8 years in the bubble, you start seeing things a certain way, and you benefit from—the democracy benefits, America benefits from some new perspectives.\nAnd I think it should be not just the prerogative, but the obligation of a new President, to examine everything that's been done and see what makes sense and what doesn't. That's what I did when I came in, and I'm assuming any new President is going to undertake those same exercises.\nAnd given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake in terms of the world economy, national security, our presence in the Asia-Pacific, China's increasing role in international affairs—there's probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and where there's also the potential if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full-conflict mode, that everybody is worse off. So I think it's fine for him to take a look at it.\nWhat I've advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you're doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. And since there's only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on what's gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what we've learned from 8 years of experience, so that as he's then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he's got all the information to make good decisions and, by the way, that all of Government is moving at the same time and singing from the same hymnal.\nAnd with respect to China—and let's just take the example of Taiwan—there has been a longstanding agreement, essentially, between China, the United States, and to some degree, the Taiwanese, which is to not change the status quo. Taiwan operates differently than mainline—mainland China does. China views Taiwan as part of China, but recognizes that it has to approach Taiwan as an entity that has its own ways of doing things. The Taiwanese have agreed that as long as they're able to continue to function with some degree of autonomy, that they won't charge forward and declare independence.\nAnd that status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful and—economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination. But understand, for China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation.\nAnd so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what are the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they'll treat some other issues. They won't even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we've had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves. And their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant.\nThat doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past. It does mean that you've got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in.\nAll right. Isaac Dovere of Politico.\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions on where this all leaves us. First——\nThe President. What leaves us? Where my Presidency leaves us?\nQ. The election——\nThe President. It leaves us in a really good spot—[laughter]—if we make some good decisions going forward.\nDemocratic National Committee/2016 Presidential Election/Electoral College/The President's Legacy\nQ. Well, what do you say to the electors who are going to meet on Monday and are thinking of changing their votes? Do you think that they should be giving—given an intelligence briefing about the Russian activity? Or should they bear in mind everything you've said and is out already? Should they—should votes be bound by the State votes as they've gone? And long term, do you think that there is a need for electoral college reform that would tie it to the popular vote?\nThe President. Okay. It sounded like two, but that was all one. [Laughter]\nQ. It was all one. [Laughter] You know the way this goes around here.\nThe President. I love how these, like, I've got two questions; each one has four parts. [Laughter] Q. On the Democratic Party, your Labor Secretary is running for—to be the chair of the Democratic National Committee.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. Is the vision that you've seen him putting forward what you think the party needs to be focused on? And what do you say to some of the complaints that say the future of the Democratic Party shouldn't be a continuation of some of your political approach? Part of that is complaints that decisions that you've made as President, as the leader of the party, have structurally weakened the DNC and the Democratic Party, and they think that that has led to—or has helped lead to some losses in elections around the country. Do you regret any of those decisions?\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. Those are my two. [Laughter]\nThe President. Good. I'll take the second one first and say that Tom Perez has been, I believe, one of the best Secretaries of Labor in our history. He is tireless. He is wicked smart. He has been able to work across the spectrum of labor, business, activists. He's produced. I mean, if you look at his body of work on behalf of working people, what he's pushed for in terms of making sure that workers get a fair deal, decent wages, better benefits, that their safety is protected on the job—he has been extraordinary.\nNow, others who have declared are also my friends and are fine people as well. And the great thing is, I don't have a vote in this, so we'll let the process unfold. I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon. I described to you earlier what I think needs to happen, which is that the Democratic Party, whether that's entirely through the DNC or through a rebuilding of State parties or some other arrangement, has to work at the grassroots level, has to be present in all 50 States, has to have a presence in counties, has to think about message and how are we speaking directly to voters.\nI will say this—and I'm not going to engage in too much punditry—but that I could not be prouder of the coalition that I put together in my—each of my campaigns because it was inclusive and it drew in people who normally weren't interested in politics and didn't participate. But I'd like to think—I think I can show—that in those elections, I always cast a broad net. I always said, first and foremost, we're Americans, that we have a common creed, that there's more that we share than divides us, and I want to talk to everybody and get a chance to get everybody's vote.\nI still believe what I said in 2004, which is this red State/blue thing is a construct. Now, it is a construct that has gotten more and more powerful for a whole lot of reasons, from gerrymandering to big money, to the way that the media has splintered. And so people are just watching what reinforces their existing biases as opposed to having to listen to different points of view. So there are all kinds of reasons for it.\nBut outside of the realm of electoral politics, I still see people the way I saw them when I made that speech—full of contradictions, and there are some regional differences, but basically, folks care about their families, they care about having meaningful work, they care about making sure their kids have more opportunity than they did. They want to be safe; they want to feel like things are fair. And whoever leads the DNC and any candidate with the Democratic brand going forward, I want them to feel as if they can reach out and find that common ground and speak to all of America. And that requires some organization. And you're right that—and I said this in my earlier remarks—that what I was able to do during my campaigns, I wasn't able to do during midterms. It's not that we didn't put in time and effort into it. I spent time and effort into it, but the coalition I put together didn't always turn out to be transferable. And the challenge is that—you know, some of that just has to do with the fact that when you're in the party in power and people are going through hard times like they were in 2010, they're going to punish, to some degree, the President's party regardless of what organizational work is done.\nSome of it has to do with just some deep-standing traditional challenges for Democrats, like during off-year elections, the electorate is older, and we do better with a younger electorate. But we know those things are true, we just—and I didn't crack the code on that. And if other people have ideas about how to do that even better, I'm all for it.\nSo on your—with respect to the electors, I'm not going to wade into that issue because, again, it's the American people's job, and now the electors' job, to decide my successor. It is not my job to decide my successor. And I have provided people with a lot of information about what happened during the course of the election. But more importantly, the candidates themselves, I think, talked about their beliefs and their vision for America. The President-elect, I think, has been very explicit about what he cares about and what he believes in. And so it's not in my hands now; it's up to them.\nQ. What about long-term about the electoral college?\nThe President. Long-term with respect to the electoral college, the electoral college is a vestige, it's a carryover from an earlier vision of how our Federal Government was going to work that put a lot of premium on States, and it used to be that the Senate was not elected directly, it was through State legislatures. And it's the same type of thinking that gives Wyoming two Senators and—with about half a million people, and California with 33 million get the same two.\nSo there are some structures in our political system, as envisioned by the Founders, that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats. But the truth of the matter is, is that, if we have a strong message, if we're speaking to what the American people care about, typically, the popular vote and the electoral college vote will align.\nAnd I guess part of my overall message here, as I leave for the holidays, is that if we look for one explanation or one silver bullet or one easy fix for our politics, then we're probably going to be disappointed. There are just a lot of factors in what's happened not just over the last few months, but over the last decade, that has made both politics and governance more challenging. And I think everybody has raised legitimate questions and legitimate concerns.\nI do hope that we all just take some time, take a breath—this is certainly what I'm going to advise Democrats—to just reflect a little bit more about, how can we get to a place where people are focused on working together based on at least some common set of facts? How can we have a conversation about policy that doesn't demonize each other? How can we channel what I think is the basic decency and goodness of the American people so it reflects itself in our politics, as opposed to it being so polarized and so nasty that, in some cases, you have voters and elected officials who have more confidence and faith in a foreign adversary than they have in their neighbors?\nAnd those go to some bigger issues. How is it that we have some voters or some elected officials who think that Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiative and school nutrition program is a greater threat to democracy than our Government going after the press if they're issuing a story they don't like? Right? I mean, that's an issue that I think we've got to wrestle with, and we will.\nPeople have asked me, how do you feel after the election and so forth, and I say, well, look, this is a clarifying moment. It's a useful reminder that voting counts, politics counts. What the President-elect is going to be doing is going to be very different than what I was doing, and I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what worked for the American people.\nAnd I hope that, building off the progress we've made, that what the President-elect is proposing works. What I can say with confidence is that what we've done works. Now, that I can prove. I can show you where we were in 2008, and I can show you where we are now, and you can't argue that we're not better off. We are. And for that, I thank the American people and, more importantly, I thank—well, not more importantly, as importantly—I was going to say Josh Earnest for doing such a great job as—[laughter]. For that, I thank the American people. I thank the men and women in uniform who serve. I haven't gotten to the point yet where I've been overly sentimental.\nI will tell you, when I was doing my last Christmas party photoline—many of you have participated in these; they're pretty long—[laughter]—right at the end of the line, the President's Marine Corps Band comes in, those who had been performing, and I take a picture with them, and it was the last time that I was going to take a picture with my Marine Corps Band after an event, and I got a little choked up. Now, I was in front of Marines, so I had to, like, tamp it down. [Laughter]\nBut it was just one small example of all the people who have contributed to our success. I'm responsible for where we've screwed up. The successes are widely shared with all the amazing people who have been part of this administration. Okay?\nThank you, everybody.

I recommended that the Senate give its advice and consent to the ratification of all of these treaties because they will help promote sound fishery management; enable us to better combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing; and prevent destructive fishing practices and contribute to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources on the high seas. I appreciate the efforts of the Congress to ensure that the United States can contribute to these international efforts.\nThe bill provides that the United States will be represented on the North Pacific Fisheries Commission by five commissioners—two appointed by the President, and the three chairpersons of the North Pacific, Pacific, and Western Pacific Fishery Management Councils, who are selected by the members of those Councils. Because the commissioners have the authority to speak on behalf of the United States before an international body, they are diplomatic officers. The Constitution grants the President the exclusive authority to represent and to decide who else will represent the United States in foreign relations. Allowing the regional fishery management chairpersons to represent the United States on the North Pacific Fisheries Commission would raise constitutional concerns.

The plane remained airborne for only 12 seconds, but Orville and Wilbur Wright's innovative legacy has endured for generations—unleashing unparalleled possibilities and forever transforming our way of life. On Wright Brothers Day, we celebrate the determination and ingenuity that drove their pursuit and recommit to shaping the future through our ideas and discoveries.\nAs self-taught mechanics, the Wright brothers devoted years to research and experimentation before taking their talents and creativity to the strong winds above Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where they completed the monumental first flight. Their mother, Susan, spent considerable time in her youth designing and building mechanical appliances; she guided her children whenever she could and always encouraged them to chase their curiosities. As Orville and Wilbur grew, they followed their entrepreneurial instincts, launching a newspaper and later opening a bicycle shop to sell their designs. Their resilience through early failed attempts at flight, and their resolve to dream big in the face of that which had never been done before, still serves as an inspiration.\nOur capacity to harness new inventions and technologies to tackle our greatest challenges has allowed our Nation to lead the world in innovation. From sending people into the skies and outer space to finding ways to instantly communicate with others across the globe, the creativity inherent in our DNA and our commitment to science have sparked our progress and set us apart. The same American spirit of innovation that led the Wright brothers to test their theories again and again—finding ways to make things work and then make them even better—is still reflected in the imagination and tenacity that move inventors and explorers to push the frontiers of what is known and achieve groundbreaking feats that were once unimaginable.\nIn upholding this legacy, we must resolve to help all young Americans understand that they can have a place in advancing science and technology—regardless of their race, gender, or circumstances. Brilliant ideas can come from anyone and anywhere, and it is our obligation to increase the availability of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) training and encourage the next generation to pursue STEM careers. This commitment to science and innovation can revitalize our communities and economies and reignite our shared sense of optimism and opportunity.\nToday, we reflect on the century of flight the Wright brothers helped make possible. Their story reminds us not just of where we have been, but where we still can go when we foster ingenuity and discovery and refuse to accept the sky as the limit. With the right investments and the perseverance of dreamers and doers who see a challenge and yearn to find a solution, there is nothing we cannot achieve.\nThe Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as \"Wright Brothers Day\" and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2016, as Wright Brothers Day.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-16", "title": "Proclamation 9557—Wright Brothers Day, 2016"}

Mulvaney has used his educational, professional, and business background to bring a focus on jobs, business and the economy to his work in Congress. He currently serves on the House Financial Services Committee as well as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nIn Congress, Rep.

If you've ever played a game of basketball in a gym or entered a contest in school or started a small business in your hometown, you know that competition is a good thing. It pushes us to do our best. And you know that a fight is only fair when everybody has a chance to win, when the playing field is level for everybody and the rules are clear and consistent.\nThat's important to our consumers, our workers, our employers, and our farmers. You deserve a fair shake, even though there might be much bigger players in the market. Without a truly competitive marketplace, those big companies can raise costs or slack off on offering good service or keep their workers' wages too low. And in an era when large corporations often merge to form even larger ones, our leaders have an even greater responsibility to look out for us as consumers.\nTo keep America's economy growing and America's businesses thriving, we need to protect the principle of fair competition. That's not, by the way, a Democratic idea or a Republican idea, it is an American idea, because it's the best way to make sure the best ideas rise to the top.\nMy administration has done a lot to keep the marketplace fair. We defended a free, open, and accessible Internet that doesn't let service providers pick winners and losers. We cracked down on conflicts of interest by making sure professionals who give your retirement advice do so in your best interests, not in theirs. And in the last few months, we've made even more progress.\nThis week, my Department of Agriculture took major steps to protect farmers from unfair treatment by bigger processors. These rules will help swine, beef cattle, and especially poultry growers who have fewer choices in where they sell their products.\nThis month, the FDA started taking steps to make hearing aids more affordable for more than the nearly 30 million Americans suffering from the frustration of hearing loss. We think people with moderate hearing loss should be able to buy a hearing aid over the counter as easily as you can buy reading glasses at your local pharmacy.\nThis year, we also addressed two other problems that keep workers and wages down: the overuse of noncompete agreements that hurt workers in the job market and the unfair practices of companies that collude to set wages below the market rate. And we backed new steps, including a law I just signed to fight robot scalpers that artificially drive up ticket prices and a rule that requires airlines to reimburse your baggage fees if your bags don't make it to your destination when you do.\nFinally, it's this principle of competition that's at the very heart of our health reform. In fact, it's the reason we call it the Affordable Care Act; it makes insurance companies compete for your business, which is helping millions afford the care that helps them get and stay healthy. By the way, it's open enrollment season right now. You can still sign up on healthcare.gov until January 31 and get covered for 2017.\nOur free market economy only works when there's competition. And competition only works when rules are in place to keep it fair and open and honest. Whether you're building the next big thing or just want to be treated right as a customer, that's good for you, and it's good for the country.\nThanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-12-17", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Viola has long been engaged with national security issues even after his military service.\nFollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, Viola worked tirelessly to support the Army philanthropically in the areas of counterterrorism, cybersecurity and leadership development, including helping to found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. He has also founded multiple high-value companies, including Virtu Financial, and chaired the New York Mercantile Exchange.

A primary focus of my leadership will be ensuring that America's soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict. This great honor comes with great responsibility, and I will fight for the American people and their right to live free every day.\"\nViola is living proof of the American dream. He was born and raised in an Italian immigrant family in Brooklyn, and his father worked a truck driver. Viola was inspired to join the military after witnessing his father's service in the U.S. Army in World War II. Viola was the first member of his family to attend college, and after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1977, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army that same year. After graduating from the Infantry Officer Basic Course and Ranger School, Viola reported to duty with the 101st Airborne Division. Viola remained a member of the U.S. Army Reserve after the completion of his active duty service. In 1983, he received his J.D. from New York Law School.\nIn the 1980s, Viola worked as a trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and also founded the first of many business ventures, including Pioneer Futures and the Independent Bank Group. After a long and influential career, Viola was appointed Chairman of NYMEX in March 2001.\nViola's leadership of NYMEX on and after 9/11 resulted in the board of Exchange recognizing his actions with a citation that included this statement:  \"His heroic leadership served as a beacon to thousands of Exchange members and staff, providing us with the fortitude to resume operations and preserve the efficiency of the American economy and global energy and metals markets in the face of this great tragedy.\" In 2008, Viola founded Virtu Financial, a global leader in electronic market making, and took the company public in 2015.\nViola has also been deeply involved in a number of philanthropic causes. Viola has endowed the Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. Chair in Catholic Theology at Fordham University and is a major supporter of the Catholic Leadership Institute and its mission to provide world-class leadership formation to bishops, priests and deacons. He is also the owner of the NHL's Florida Panthers.\nViola lives in New York City with his wife Teresa.

He has a deep understanding of global resources, a fair-minded approach to understanding complex issues, and an appreciation for the work of all of the branches of the armed services. His interests range from education to technology, from the military to the Middle East. A West Point graduate, he is well-informed across a spectrum of ideas and approaches to American foreign and military policy, preparing him well to make informed and thoughtful decisions.\"\nDick Grasso, former Chairman and CEO, New York Stock Exchange (1995-2003):\n''I have been privileged to call Vinnie Viola a dear friend since we began working together almost twenty years ago when he served as Chairman, New York Mercantile Exchange, and I was Chairman of The New York Stock Exchange. While the consummate professional and natural leader, Vinnie's greatest leadership of the NYMEX came in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. He was faced with the almost impossible task of restoring trading in a building which was only steps from the fallen twin towers. It was clear that his education at West Point, and his leadership skills from active duty service would accept nothing less than complete restoration of trading no matter the challenges presented. He worked 24/7 with city and state officials and his private sector partners to ensure a prompt resumption of trading which I was honored to attend. As a graduate of West Point, he presided, posted the colors, presented our national anthem, and credited everyone but himself for this incredible feat. Vinnie's love of our nation and those who serve is simply remarkable. If confirmed, he will make an outstanding Secretary of the Army.\"\nBruce Hoffman, a senior fellow at the Combating Terrorism Center:\n\"...Trump's nomination of Viola is an 'inspired pick.' He was a driving force in both forming and funding the center, and was motivated by his experiences helping colleagues at the New York Mercantile Exchange evacuate from lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hoffman said.\n\"'He was always in the background there, but it was never about him,' Hoffman said of Viola's influence on the West Point center. 'He imparted his wisdom on a one-to-one basis, but he was not someone who was up that mic and or the dais. It was never about him.'\" (Washington Post)", "timestamp": "2016-12-19", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Leaders Praise the Selection of Vincent Viola to Serve as Secretary of the Army"}

The Atlantic canyons themselves, majestic geologic features carved by glacial runoff or by rivers that once flowed overland and were submerged by rising seas after the last ice age, have incredible ecological importance. The massive underwater canyons are home to many species and have been the subject of scientific exploration and discovery since the 1970s.\nThis action builds on the President's creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which protects 4,913 square miles of marine ecosystems located 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod. Today's action withdraws from oil and gas leasing, exploration, and development the remaining 31 major Atlantic canyons that are not already protected by the National Monument, ensuring these unique biological and geological resources will not be impacted by any future oil and gas activities in this area. The canyons are located in U.S. waters along the Atlantic continental shelf break running from Heezen Canyon offshore New England to Norfolk Canyon offshore the Chesapeake Bay. The withdrawn area totals 5,990 square miles (or 3.8 million acres).\nOcean temperatures in the Northeast U.S. are projected to increase three times faster than the global average, according to a study released earlier this year by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, the first of several assessments to analyze the impacts of climate change on fish stocks and fishing-dependent communities found that warming oceans are threatening the majority of fish species in the region including salmon, lobster, and scallops. Today's designation will help safeguard the resilience of that unique ecosystem, ensure a refuge for at-risk species, and protect these natural laboratories for scientists to monitor and explore the impacts of climate change.\n* Today's action recognizes the unique marine environment in the Atlantic and fishing's critical role in the region's economy and culture. Specifically, the withdrawal includes areas that support habitat important to commercial and recreational fisheries. The withdrawal does not impact ocean uses beyond mineral exploration and development.\nThe canyons are a defining characteristic of the Atlantic continental margin offshore the east coast of the United States. The canyons were formed when sea level was lower and rivers flowed to the margin of the continental shelf before the canyons were flooded by the sea when ice melted after the last glacial maximum some 25,000 years ago. The largest canyon is Hudson Canyon, which reaches depths in excess of 10,000 feet and is comparable in scale to the Grand Canyon, which is 6,093 feet at its deepest.\nThe canyons are widely recognized as hotspots of biodiversity, biologically unique, and ecologically and economically valuable for fisheries. The protected areas provide:\n* Habitat for endemic and numerous other species, including deep-water corals, deep diving beaked whales, commercially valuable fishes, and significant numbers of habitat-forming soft and hard corals, sponges, and crabs;\n* Important biological areas for many species of fish managed collectively in the Atlantic under the designation ‘Highly Migratory Species', including numerous large, commercially valuable species such as marlin, sailfish, swordfish, tunas, and sharks; and\n* Habitat for protected species such as sea turtles and marine mammals, including endangered sperm, fin, and sei whales and Kemp's ridley turtles.\nResearch demonstrates that the canyons provide valuable ecosystem services and economic benefits in addition to being places of refuge for species. Many of these species live many years, have low reproductive rates, grow slowly, and rely on the habitats provided by canyon features throughout their lifespans.\nThere are several examples of species or species groups that rely heavily upon canyon ecosystems. Marine mammal density data for a number of species clearly demonstrates an affinity with the continental shelf margin where the canyons are located. Species such as tuna and swordfish have been associated with canyons, particularly Hudson, Baltimore, and Norfolk Canyons. Golden tilefish, a large and long-lived species, occupies habitat in a relatively restricted band crossing the canyons. Norfolk Canyon is a Habitat Area of Particular Concern (a designation under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act) for this species. Deep-water and canyon ecosystems are also important to the deep-sea red crab at all stages of its life cycle.\nA number of Atlantic canyon studies have been conducted on the region. One recent effort was undertaken by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), within the Department of the Interior (Interior), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce. Utilizing remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), substantial densities of deep-water corals were observed in both Norfolk and Baltimore Canyons. Some species were observed for the first time in these areas, including the important structure-forming species Lophelia pertusa.1 Four other research efforts were conducted between 2012 and 2014, targeting nine mid-Atlantic canyons. The canyons investigated proved to be biodiversity hotspots, hosting many different species of coral, numerous fish species, several squids and octopus, and various sea stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. These canyons were generally characterized by downslope areas of soft sediment leading up to steep walls with abundant biological communities under overhangs.\nSome of the Atlantic canyon studies have shown that the diversity of habitat types creates a higher density of benthic species within canyons than at similar depths outside of canyons.2 The presence of canyons can also influence fishery production by concentrating organic matter and enhancing local productivity, providing habitat and prey species, and concentrating species in a discrete area.3 Early studies, now confirmed by recent extensive work by BOEM and others, focused on the mid-Atlantic canyons and demonstrated that the canyons in this area can include unique biological communities associated with hard substrate exposed in and near the canyon features. These communities can include significant numbers of habitat-forming soft and hard corals, sponges, crabs, and fish species such as summer flounder, black sea bass, and tilefish.\nDeep-water assemblages of hard (scleractinian) corals are a particularly significant community type in the deep-sea due to their ability to create complex habitat within the structure formed by the coral itself. Although significant colonies of well-known scleractinian corals such as Lophelia are rare within canyons, other corals including antipatharians (black corals) and gorgonians (e.g., sea fans) add significant community structure and potential for high community diversity. Studies world-wide have shown that cold-water corals support high biodiversity but are long-lived and slow-growing, making them susceptible to physical disturbance by human activities. Such studies have also highlighted the importance of cold-water corals as habitat for deep-water fishes, indicators of past ocean climate regimes, and sources of novel biological compounds. Deep-water corals, particularly gorgonians, have been observed in most all of the canyons where hard substrate is exposed.\nThe abundance and distribution of bottom fish species are different within and outside of canyons. Bottom fish are more abundant within the canyons compared to habitats at the same depth outside of canyon features. In addition, the species composition within canyons differs from that of open water habitats at the same depth. Canyons provide a more complex habitat and may serve to trap and concentrate prey species. Atlantic canyons are also important biological areas for many of fish managed collectively in the Atlantic under the designation ‘Highly Migratory Species' (HMS) which include numerous large, commercially valuable species such as marlin, sailfish, swordfish, tunas, and sharks. These species and some other fishes are known to travel great distances to reach the canyons.4\nStudies of individual canyons along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. and Canada have shown that certain species of marine mammals have a high affinity to canyon ecosystems. This is especially true for deep diving whales, including beaked whales and sperm whales.\nIn addition, and of great importance, the canyons are regions of enhanced biodiversity and play an important role in climate stability. The northwestern Atlantic is expected to be heavily impacted by climate change. The canyons provide important shelf and slope habitat heterogeneity that could offer refuge for species potentially impacted by climate change.\nOil and gas activities have the potential to impact the seafloor wherever these activities occur. This includes discharge of oil, drilling muds, cuttings, and other debris that could affect seafloor habitats in the immediate vicinity of a well. Bottom disturbance associated with drilling, infrastructure emplacement, pipeline trenching, and removal of structures could also affect the seafloor. The withdrawal of these canyons from mineral leasing will help protect habitats, preserve critical ecological hot spots, conserve economically valuable fisheries, afford long-term opportunity for research and exploration, and help ensure that species dependent on the habitats of the canyons are protected.\nThe effect of a Presidential withdrawal is to indefinitely exclude the withdrawn area from leasing for mineral exploration and development. The President previously used this authority in December 2014 and January 2015 when he withdrew from leasing the Bristol Bay off of Alaska, home to world-class fisheries and stunning beauty, and certain areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas because of their critical ecological and cultural values.\nThe Atlantic canyon region has a very limited oil and gas history, with no active leases since the mid-1990s and no production of oil and gas. The potential impact on hydrocarbon resources is estimated to be minimal. Oil and exploration and development would also be challenging due to technical and operational risks related to the canyon geology.", "timestamp": "2016-12-20", "title": "Fact Sheet: Fact Sheet: Unique Atlantic Canyons Protected from Oil and Gas Activity"}

This action, as recommended by Secretary Jewell, is based on several factors, each of which separately would be sufficient to support the action:\n* The U.S. Arctic is a unique, vibrant, and vulnerable ecosystem that is home to several Federally listed and candidate species under the Endangered Species Act, including iconic and culturally valuable species, and upon which many Alaska Native communities rely for subsistence use and cultural traditions;\n* Even recognizing the substantial steps taken by this Administration to improve the safety of potential Arctic exploration and development, there would still be significant risks associated with offshore drilling operations given that the U.S. Arctic is characterized by harsh environmental conditions, geographic remoteness, and a relative lack of fixed infrastructure and existing oil and gas operations. The consequences of an oil spill in this region could be substantially detrimental to the ecosystem;\nConsidering these factors, the risks associated with oil and gas activity in remote and harsh Arctic environments are not worth taking when the United States has ample energy sources near existing infrastructure elsewhere. Furthermore, while the withdrawal area does contain oil and gas resources, if oil prices remain at current levels, production of these resources would be cost-prohibitive and would not take place. Even if oil prices were more than 200 percent above their current level, production of these resources would not take place for 10-50 years because of the lead time associated with exploration and development activities.\nThis action is consistent with the steps the United States and the international community will take in the coming decades to transition energy systems away from fossil fuels - particularly because any potential significant Arctic offshore production would only occur around the middle of this century, a timeline that is incongruous with our nation's need and international commitments to reduce carbon emissions.\nThe withdrawal would not affect a nearshore area of the Beaufort Sea, totaling 2.8 million acres, that has high oil and gas resource potential and is adjacent to existing state oil and gas activity and infrastructure. While there are significant concerns about oil and gas activity occurring in this area, it will be subject to additional evaluation and study to determine if new leasing could be appropriate at some point in the future. The five year leasing program for 2017-2022 issued by the Department of the Interior does not include lease sales in the Arctic.\nEcological Value and Fragility of the United States' Arctic\nThe U.S. Arctic Ocean possesses unique physical and ecological characteristics. The movement and presence of sea ice is a dominant feature of the Arctic seascape and impacts the physical, biological, and cultural aspects of life in the area. Seasonal pack ice moves south into the region during the winter months when it is dark from mid-November to mid-January. Sea ice covers the Beaufort Shelf for about nine months of the year and reaches its maximum extent in March. Landfast ice (ice that forms adjacent to and extends from the land) starts to form in October and can extend up to 25 miles from shore. The pack ice retreats during the summer, reaching its minimum extent in September. The Arctic OCS is known for its ice-associated animals, including several species of seals, Pacific walrus, polar bears, and more than 98 species of fish. Other marine mammal species, including a number of whale species, occur in the area. Many bird species are found on the shore and in the waters above the Arctic OCS, including waterfowl (e.g., eiders, long-tailed duck, and geese) and shorebirds such as the red-necked phalarope.\nThe Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are home to several Federally listed and candidate species under the Endangered Species Act, including the bowhead whale, fin whale, Pacific walrus, polar bear, spectacled eider, and Steller's eider.1 These two seas include extensive polar bear critical habitat designated under the Endangered Species Act.2 Designated critical habitat for the threatened spectacled eider occurs on the Chukchi Sea coast of Alaska. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has designated portions of the Hanna Shoal region in the Chukchi Sea as a core use area for Pacific walrus (a candidate species for listing), known as the Hanna Shoal Walrus Use Area.3 Many of these species, including bowhead, beluga and gray whales, walrus and polar bears use large portions of the withdrawn area for feeding, resting, and migration.4\nThe land areas adjacent to the Arctic OCS are sparsely populated, but Alaska Native communities of the North Slope depend largely on the natural environment, especially the marine environment, for food and materials. The environment is integrally linked with the cultural and spiritual values of these communities. Each year, Native communities across northern Alaska participate in a bowhead whale hunt that is central to their cultural tradition and vital for subsistence.\nThe recently completed 2017-2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program and accompanying Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) both highlight the unique nature of the entirety of the U.S. Arctic, while also identifying and analyzing Environmentally Important Areas (EIAs). The EIAs, developed during the analysis process for the 2017-2022 Oil and Gas Leasing Program, represent regions of especially important environmental value where there is potential for conflict between ecologically important or sensitive habitats; maintenance of social, cultural, and economic resources; and possible oil and gas development. The identification and analysis of two EIAs in the Chukchi Sea and four in the Beaufort Sea demonstrate the interconnectedness of this ecosystem, as the ecologically significant resources within the EIAs could be dramatically impacted by activities outside of those areas. The potential for broad scale impacts to the region is especially true in the case of an oil spill where the scale of impact will be enhanced due to the uniqueness of the environment and difficulties associated with spill response, mitigation, and restoration in the remote Arctic environment. Finally, many of the species and ecosystem components are not limited to the EIAs themselves, which, while examples of valuable habitat, cannot account for species migrations and potential long term shifts in species' behaviors and locations associated with climate change. Thus, although the EIAs identify and assess regions of especially important environmental value with ecologically important or sensitive habitats and/or subsistence and cultural value for the local communities, the resources within those areas are vulnerable to activities that occur outside of them and these resources exist broadly across the area being identified for withdrawal. Comprehensive protection of the area is warranted, as limiting protection to the EIAs would fail to protect ecosystem function and services critical to the region. Additionally, a larger footprint is appropriate to account for the way in which oil could spread, if a spill were to occur, as the EIAs themselves will not adequately protect important species.5 A brief description of the ecologically significant characteristics of the areas proposed to be withdrawn is provided below.\nIn addition, climate change-induced temperature increases are occurring fastest in polar regions, including the U.S. Arctic, resulting in a disproportionate amount of changes to the physical, biological, and chemical environments, such as alteration of species distribution, reduction in seasonal ice cover, and loss of permafrost. Loss of sea ice coverage reduces the available habitat for ice-dependent species such as seals, polar bears, and Pacific walrus. Such conditions and stressors may increase the vulnerability of these species and habitat and reduce their resilience to impacts of oil and gas activities.\nChukchi Sea\nThe Chukchi Sea Planning Area includes important habitat for marine mammals, birds, fish, and other animals. The coastal region of this area is covered in sea ice from winter through early summer; breaks and openings in this ice provide habitat for whales migrating from the Bering Sea up into the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas during the spring and summer and back south in the fall. Walrus and ice seals use this area and are taken by Native Alaska subsistence hunters as a source of food and materials. Many species of birds follow this system of ice north from the Bering Sea into the Arctic waters and inland to habitats along the North Slope. During the summer, walrus use the coastal and offshore areas of the Chukchi Sea extensively as they move between the coast and the areas where they feed in the vicinity of the existing Hanna Shoal Presidential Withdrawal area. There are areas of designated \"essential fish habitat\" within the Chukchi Sea Planning Area and large portions of the Chukchi have been designated as critical habitat for the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act.\nTwo EIAs were identified in the 2017-2022 Five Year Program PEIS, the Walrus Foraging Area and the Walrus Movement Corridor. The Walrus Foraging Area EIA surrounds the current Hanna Shoal Presidential Withdrawal and includes the FWS-designated Hanna Shoal Walrus Use Area (HSWUA); the Walrus Movement Corridor EIA includes an area between the Hanna Shoal Presidential Withdrawal and the existing Chukchi Corridor Presidential Withdrawal and captures portions of the area walruses use to transit from nearshore and onshore haul out areas and feeding areas in and around the existing Hanna Shoal Presidential Withdrawal. The FWS HSWUA designation is based on walrus tagging studies conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey that have tracked walrus movements and identified foraging and resting habitat. The Foraging Area includes habitat that is critical for the Pacific walrus, including areas of high benthic biomass within shallow waters where sea ice persists into the summer. Walruses forage in this area from June to October and can occur in high numbers. This area also includes areas of high biological productivity that serve the foraging needs of other marine mammals.6 These EIAs underscore the vulnerability of the Chukchi Sea Planning Area and while withdrawing these areas alone would help protect some ecological resources, it would not reduce all risks to these important areas. Fully protecting these areas, the migration pathways between them, and accounting for long term shifts as a result of climate change will ensure that the EIAs, the previous Chukchi Sea Presidential Withdrawal, and areas critical to essential marine life and subsistence activities will be protected from risks associated with mineral leasing.7\nBeaufort Sea\nThe Beaufort Sea Planning Area encompasses habitat for many of the same species found in the Chukchi Sea. Bowhead and beluga whales use the shelf and shelf break waters of the Beaufort extensively throughout the year. Ice seals and polar bear use nearshore and offshore habitats as they rest, feed, and reproduce, often following the movement of the ice as it expands in the winter and retreats during the summer. A variety of bird species use the Beaufort Sea year-round, including seabirds that forage offshore and shorebirds that \"stage\" here as they begin their fall migration. Large portions of the Beaufort Sea Planning Area and adjacent waters are designated critical habitat for polar bears. There is also designated \"essential fish habitat\" throughout the area. Subsistence hunting takes place in many communities along the Beaufort coast, from Kaktovik in the east to Barrow, Alaska.\nThe Barrow Canyon EIA is an important migration and foraging area for beluga whales, bowhead whales, gray whales, and many species of birds.8 Several studies show that beluga and bowhead whales use this area preferentially, particularly in the fall; bowhead whales have high relative residence times in the area during their westward migration.9 The southern portions of the Barrow Canyon EIA encompass relatively high densities of birds during summer (June to September), including brant geese and king eider.10 The EIA encompasses areas of high benthic biomass and high productivity, likely driving the associated occurrence of marine mammals and birds. The Barrow Canyon EIA lies offshore to the east of Point Barrow at the nexus of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The presence of marine mammals in this area makes it important for subsistence hunting.\nThe Camden Bay EIA is important ecologically and for subsistence use.11 The Camden Bay area is important to bowhead whales, beluga whales, and for seal feeding, and is also an important bowhead whale hunting area in the fall.12 This area was shown to be a \"hotspot\" for both marine mammals and seabirds.13\nThe Kaktovik EIA captures areas of important habitat for bowhead whales during their fall migration when they are travelling near shore; the eastern portion of the EIA overlaps with marine mammal \"hotspots\".14 The EIA overlaps areas where subsistence hunters target bowhead whales in the fall. The portion of this EIA that lies to the west of the existing Presidential Withdrawal is important habitat for brant geese, while the eastern side captures habitat for red-throated loon. Both of these areas show persistent, long-term, high density of bird occurrence.15 Many polar bear dens have been identified in this area over the past century, and this area of the Beaufort Sea coast is expected to remain important denning and feeding habitat areas for polar bears during the winter as the sea ice extent continues to change.16\nThe fourth EIA analyzed in the 2017-2022 Program is Cross Island. The portion of the Cross Island EIA that does not overlap with the high resource potential area and is not in close proximity to existing infrastructure is being withdrawn.\nThe proposed withdrawal areas in the Beaufort Sea will serve as a refuge for the animals that use the waters of the Arctic OCS and protect the interconnected components of this ecosystem, including the EIAs and migration pathways between them as well as accounting for potential shifts in critical habitat as the ecosystem continues to shift in the face of climate change.\nOil Spill Risks\nThe U.S. Arctic is ice-covered for eight to nine months of the year, with almost complete darkness for nearly three months. The nearest U.S. Coast Guard air base in Kodiak, Alaska and the nearest major port in Dutch Harbor, Alaska are both approximately 1,000 miles away.\nOil spill response and clean-up raises unique challenges in the Arctic. While there is a substantial knowledge base on oil spill response gained from experiments, research, and practical experience responding to spills, much of the work has been done in temperate climates.17 Lower water temperatures or sea ice will slow down or eliminate the processes that control oil weathering, such as evaporation and natural dispersion. A large spill occurring on or under ice would be trapped and persist until the ice melted, allowing trapped oil to disperse. Volatile components of the oil would be more likely to freeze into the ice rather than dissolve or disperse into the water column. In addition, seasonally limited daylight can be a major issue for oil spill response during freeze up, and over the winter. The impacts could be major to subsistence uses, birds, mammals, and other sea life. An oil spill during periods of restricted open water could have severe effects, as whales such as the bowhead and beluga use open water areas in the ice during their migrations and would concentrate within these areas in the spring. An oil spill in the Arctic creates substantial challenges for clean up and current techniques have not been proven when oil is mixed with ice or trapped under ice. Additionally, unlike the Gulf of Mexico, logistical support in the Arctic region is very limited and is expected to remain limited given the remote location.\nWhile regulatory improvement, such as the requirements for exploratory drilling in the Arctic and other business practices, have decreased the probability of an oil spill, offshore exploration and development continue to pose risks. In its analysis for the most recent lease sale in the Chukchi Sea, the Department of the Interior estimated that over the course of the 77 year life of the development scenario analyzed, there was a 75 percent chance of one or more large spills (1,000 barrels) occurring. The most recent analysis in the 2017-2022 Five Year Program PEIS found some accidental spills to be reasonably foreseeable and assumed, based on historical data and the harsh nature of Arctic conditions, that there could be up to one large spill (3,282 barrels) in each of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas from a platform and up to four spills from pipelines (3,750 barrels) in each sea based on estimates of production volume. A substantially greater number of smaller spills, between 1 and 1,000 barrels, could also occur based on production estimates analyzed in that document. These spills could have substantial impacts on the region, particularly given the ecosystem fragility and limited available resources to respond to a spill.\nLimited Oil and Gas History and Interest\nWhile the withdrawal area does contain oil and gas resources, if oil prices remain at current levels, production of these resources would be cost-prohibitive and would not take place. Even if oil prices were more than 200 percent above their current level, production of these resources would not take place for 10-50 years because of the lead time associated with exploration and development activities.\nThere is a history of some lease sales in the withdrawn areas, but there has been very limited activity and industry has demonstrated its declining interest in the Arctic waters:\n* Over the past 37 years, only 43 wells - six exploration wells in the Chukchi Sea and 30 exploration and seven development wells in the Beaufort Sea - have been drilled.\n* The only existing offshore Federal production is from the Northstar Field in the Beaufort Sea.\n* Federal offshore Arctic leases declined over 90 percent this year due primarily to relinquishments by leaseholders, from 527 in February 2016 to only 43 as of October 2016, with most of these expected to expire in 2017.\nTaken together, the acreage under lease amounts to approximately 205,000 acres out of a total acreage of approximately 128 million acres in the two Planning Areas.\nThe withdrawal will not affect the rights of existing leases.\nLengthy Production Timeline\nIt is also important to note that this action is consistent with the steps the United States and the international community will take in the coming decades to reduce carbon pollution. In contrast, if lease sales were to occur and production take place, it would be at a time when the scientific realities of climate change dictate that the United States and the international community must be transitioning its energy systems away from fossil fuels.\n* Even at substantially higher oil prices, production would not begin for at least 10 years following a lease sale, which could occur in the mid-to late 2030's at the earliest, and last up to 75 years.\n* No infrastructure or production exists in the Chukchi Sea.\n* In the Chukchi Sea, production could require 190 separate onshore pipeline miles each for oil and gas and 300 separate onshore pipeline miles for both oil and gas, requiring substantial and enormously expensive new infrastructure in sensitive places.\nThese timelines would only bring significant new oil and gas resources into the market at a time when the United States and its international partners must be transitioning to alternative energy sources to reduce emissions. While many agree that, during the transition to cleaner energy sources, the United States will continue to rely on oil and gas resources for some period of time, there is ample supply for that purpose in mature areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.\nBuilding on Administration's Past Efforts\nThis action builds on past steps the President has taken to protect fragile ecosystems, build resilience in the face of climate change, and incorporate traditional knowledge into Arctic decision making, including:\n* Creation of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area to protect the health of the marine ecosystems of the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait, including making 40,300 square miles off limits from oil and gas leasing.\n* Designation of areas of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas as off limits from oil and gas leasing based on their ecological value and importance to Alaska Native subsistence users.\n* Designation of the waters of Bristol Bay, known for its world-class fisheries and stunning beauty, as off limits to oil and gas activity.\n* Convening of the White House Arctic Science Ministerial, including hosting more than 30 Alaska Native leaders and representatives from five Indigenous organizations from across the Arctic to share their concerns and priorities on how to respond to Arctic-science challenges; strengthen Arctic observations and data-sharing; expand regional resilience; and incorporate Arctic science in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.", "timestamp": "2016-12-20", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama Protects 125 Million Acres of the Arctic Ocean"}

They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant, and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region's harsh conditions is limited. By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region, at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.\nIn 2015, just 0.1 percent of U.S. Federal offshore crude production came from the Arctic, and Department of Interior analysis shows that, at current oil prices, significant production in the Arctic will not occur. That's why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector. My administration has proposed and directed unprecedented Federal investments in the region, but more must be done—by the Federal Government, the private sector, and philanthropy—to enhance infrastructure and our collective security, such as the acquisition of additional icebreaking capacity, and to lay the groundwork for economic growth in the industries of the future.", "timestamp": "2016-12-20", "title": "Statement on the Withdrawal of Certain Areas in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans on the Outer Continental Shelf From Mineral Leasing"}

An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121359", "text": "In March, President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau announced a new partnership to embrace opportunities and confront challenges in the changing Arctic, with Indigenous and Northern partnerships, and responsible, science-based leadership. Over the past year, both countries have engaged a range of partners and stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples and Northern communities, state, provincial and territorial governments, nongovernmental organizations and businesses. Those consulted have expressed a strong desire for real and long-term opportunities to build strong families, communities, and robust economies. Today, President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau are proud to launch actions ensuring a strong, sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem, with low-impact shipping, science based management of marine resources, and free from the future risks of offshore oil and gas activity. Together, these actions set the stage for deeper partnerships with other Arctic nations, including through the Arctic Council.\nScience-based approach to oil and gas:\nIn March, the United States and Canada committed that commercial activities will occur only if the highest safety and environmental standards are met, and if they are consistent with national and global climate and environmental goals. Today—due to the important, irreplaceable values of its Arctic waters for Indigenous, Alaska Native and local communities' subsistence and cultures, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and scientific research; the vulnerability of these ecosystems to an oil spill; and the unique logistical, operational, safety, and scientific challenges and risks of oil extraction and spill response in Arctic waters—the United States is designating the vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasing, and Canada will designate all Arctic Canadian waters as indefinitely off limits to future offshore Arctic oil and gas licensing, to be reviewed every five years through a climate and marine science-based life-cycle assessment. [White House note: Taking into account the respective obligations of the United States and Canada under international law to protect and preserve the marine environment, these steps also support the goals of various international frameworks and commitments concerning pollution, including those reflected in the 1990 International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation, the 2013 Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic, and the U.S.-Canada Joint Marine Pollution Contingency Plan. Furthermore, with respect to areas of the Beaufort Sea where the U.S.-Canada maritime boundary has not yet been agreed, these practical arrangements are without prejudice to either side's position and demonstrate self-restraint, taking into account the principle of making every effort not to jeopardize or hamper reaching a final maritime boundary agreement.]\nSupporting strong Arctic communities:\nIn March, both countries committed to defining new approaches and exchanging best practices to strengthen the resilience of Arctic communities and continuing to support the well-being of Arctic residents, in particular respecting the rights and territory of Indigenous peoples.\nRecently, in direct response to requests from Alaska Native communities, President Obama created the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area protecting the cultural and subsistence resources of over 80 tribes as well as one of the largest seasonal migrations of marine mammals in the world of bowhead and beluga whales, walrus, ice seals, and sea birds. The United States also launched an interagency Economic Development Assessment Team in the Nome region of Alaska to identify future investment opportunities, with other regions to follow. In addition, the Arctic Funders Collaborative (AFC), a group of 11 U.S., Canadian, and international philanthropic foundations, announced the coordination and mobilization of an estimated $27 million in resources for programs across the Arctic over the next three years.\nToday, for its part, Canada is committing to co-develop a new Arctic Policy Framework, with Northerners, territorial and Provincial governments, and First Nations, Inuit, and Métis People that will replace Canada's Northern Strategy. The Framework will include priority areas identified by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs' Special Representative, such as education, infrastructure, and economic development. The Framework will include an Inuit-specific component, created in partnership with Inuit, as Inuit Nunangat comprises over a third of Canada's land mass and over half of Canada's coast line, and as Inuit modern treaties govern this jurisdictional space. In parallel, Canada is reducing the reliance of Northern communities on diesel, by deploying energy efficiency and renewable power. Canada will also, with Indigenous and Northern partners, explore how to support and protect the future of the Arctic Ocean's \"last ice area\" where summer ice remains each year.\nLow impact shipping corridors:\nIn March, the United States and Canada committed to working together to establish consistent policies for ships operating in the region. Today, both countries are launching the first processes ever to identify sustainable shipping lanes throughout their connected Arctic waters, in collaboration with Northern and Indigenous partners. The U.S. Coast Guard is launching a Port Access Route Study (PARS) in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. [White House note: In conducting this study, and consistent with existing authorities, the Coast Guard will consider traditional knowledge from local communities, the effects of shipping and vessel pollution on the marine environment, marine mammal migratory pathways and other biologically important areas, subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing, and the needs of maritime safety and commerce.] Results from this analysis may be used to establish vessel routing measures including traffic separation schemes, recommended routes, Areas To Be Avoided, or other instruments such as fairways where no structures may be erected. The Canadian Coast Guard and Transport Canada is implementing Northern Marine Transportation Corridors, determining what infrastructure and navigational and emergency response services are needed. Canada is also launching a new program to support training curriculum for Northerners, particularly Indigenous peoples, to join the marine field, as well as programming to support marine infrastructure and safety equipment for communities.\nIn addition, the U.S. Coast Guard, in consultation with industry, Indigenous communities, and the State of Alaska, has begun a strategy to phase down the use of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in the Arctic. The Canadian Coast Guard is conducting similar outreach and consultations to develop proposals to phase down the use of HFO in 2017. The United States and Canada will each, or jointly, propose a plan for consideration at the International Maritime Organization's spring 2017 meeting.\nScience-based management of Arctic fisheries:\nIn March, the United States and Canada called for a binding international agreement to prevent the opening of unregulated fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean and to build on a precautionary, science-based approach to commercial fishing that both countries have put in place in their Arctic waters. Today, the United States commits to supporting and strengthening existing commercial fishing closures in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, and to conducting scientific research to improve our understanding of the Arctic. Canada commits to working with Northern and Indigenous communities to build world-leading and abundant Arctic fisheries—based on science—that firstly benefit Northern communities. Together, the United States' and Canada's actions will create the largest contiguous area of well-regulated fisheries in the world.\nBoth countries reaffirm their commitment to a legally binding agreement to prevent unregulated commercial fisheries in the Arctic High Seas until an internationally recognized Regional Fishery Management Organization is in place to provide effective management. Both countries are working towards such an agreement in the coming months.", "timestamp": "2016-12-20", "title": "Joint Statement—United States-Canada Joint Arctic Leaders' Statement"}

The winning coalition, led by ARMI, Inc. and headquartered in Manchester, NH will develop next-generation manufacturing techniques for repairing and replacing cells and tissues, which may one day lead to the ability to manufacture new skin for soldiers scarred from combat or develop organ-preserving technologies to benefit Americans waiting for an organ transplant.\nThe Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute being announced today is the twelfth manufacturing hub awarded by the Obama Administration, and follows on the heels of two other hubs announced in the last two weeks—the  National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals, the first open-topic institute and the first institute awarded by the Department of Commerce, headquartered in Newark, DE; and the  Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment Institute, awarded by the Department of Energy, headquartered in New York, NY.\nToday at the White House, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall will announce the winning consortium before an audience of stakeholders from industry, academia, and government, including senior leaders from the White House, Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, and representatives from many of the existing Manufacturing USA institutes.\nIn the four years since its establishment, Manufacturing USA has grown from one institute with 65 members to a network of now 12 institutes with nearly 1,000 members. The institutes are already attracting new business investment to their regions, developing the cutting-edge technologies to drive American leadership, and training the workforce that will apply new skills to our manufacturing sector. Across the Manufacturing USA institutes, the Federal government has committed over $850 million, which has been matched by more than $1.8 billion in non-Federal investment. Today's progress builds on important bipartisan action from Congress, which in 2015 passed the bipartisan Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation to formally authorize the program, proving that strengthening American manufacturing is a goal on which we can all agree.\nAfter a decade of decline from 2000 to 2009, the U.S. manufacturing sector has added over 800,000 jobs since early 2010. Despite recent headwinds, the foundation for U.S. manufacturing is stronger than it has been in decades. Just this year, a new report on global manufacturing competitiveness found that manufacturing executives view the United States as the best location in the world for manufacturing in the years ahead.\nThe New Manufacturing USA Institute Awards\nManufacturing USA connects people, ideas, and technology to solve industry-relevant advanced manufacturing challenges, enhancing industrial competitiveness and economic growth and strengthening our national security. Each manufacturing institute is designed to build U.S. leadership and regional excellence in critical emerging manufacturing technologies by bridging the gap between early research and product development; bringing together companies, universities, and other academic and training institutions, and Federal agencies to co-invest in key technology areas that can encourage investment and production in the United States while serving as a ‘teaching factory' for workers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs looking to develop new skills or prototype new products and processes.\nRepairing and replacing cells, tissues, and organs. Announced today, the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute is poised to develop next-generation manufacturing techniques for repairing and replacing cells and tissues, which may one day lead to the ability to manufacture new skin for soldiers scarred from combat or develop organ-preserving technologies to benefit Americans stuck on organ transplant waiting lists. Headquartered in Manchester, NH, ARMI will focus on solving the cross-cutting manufacturing challenges that stand in the way of producing new synthetic tissues and organs—such as improving the availability, reproducibility, accessibility, and standardization of manufacturing materials, technologies, and processes to create tissue and organ products. ARMI will convene leaders from a multitude of disciplines, from cell biology and bioengineering to materials science and computer modeling. The partners will work to develop high-throughput culture and 3D biofabication techniques to non-invasive, real-time testing and sensing to measure the viability of engineered tissue constructs.\nIndustry Partners: Abbott, Autodesk, Becton Dickinson, Celularity, DEKA Research & Development, GenCure, Humacyte, Lonza, Medtronic, Rockwell Automation, and United Therapeutics\nGovernment and non-profit organizations: FIRST, the State of New Hampshire, and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships in multiple states\nUniversities and Other Schools: Arizona State University, Boston University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rutgers, Stanford University, the University of Florida, the University of Minnesota, the University of New Hampshire, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Yale University\nLife-saving bio-therapies.

Read more  here.\nEarly Successes from Manufacturing USA\nTogether, the Manufacturing USA institutes are already enhancing U.S. competitiveness in advanced manufacturing—from helping Youngstown, OH attract over $90 million in new manufacturing investments to its region and train 14,000 workers in the fundamentals of 3D printing for businesses, to supporting companies like X-FAB in Lubbock, TX upgrade to next-generation power semiconductors and sustain hundreds of jobs. These public-private partnerships are bringing value to their members and regions by providing:\n•      Technological Innovation: By accelerating the transition from design to Made in USA, the institutes are developing emerging manufacturing technologies—for example, America Makes, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute in Youngstown, OH enabled one of its founding members, Oxford Performance Materials, Inc., to become the first company to receive clearance from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to manufacture 3D-printed polymer implants for use in surgical procedures in the United States.\n•      Collaborative Constituencies: The institutes align pre-competitive industry priorities by combining the efforts of manufacturers across geographies and supply chains—for example, the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (AIM Photonics), the Integrated Photonics Institute in Rochester, NY, has members on both coasts that, collectively, comprise the entire supply chain for integrated photonics, from microfabrication processing training and circuit design centers in Massachusetts; to wafer foundry, packaging, and assembly centers in New York; to integrated photonic device manufacturers in California.\n•      Leveraged Investments: For companies, institute membership provides access to unique equipment and capabilities that are too costly for any one company to undertake—for example, Advanced Functional Fabrics of America (AFFOA), the Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles institute in Cambridge, MA, is standing up a distributed, on-demand foundry to rapidly identify domestic manufacturing pathways within its membership to accelerate the design-to-product process.\n•      Networked Expertise: Manufacturing USA is at its best when the institutes are working together— for example, to create a talent pipeline of multi-skilled manufacturing technicians. This cross-institute effort is designed to match talent demands from industry members with the best content from academia members, define promising career pathways, and align workforce investment resources across municipalities, states, and regions.\n•      Customized Training: Institutes act as \"teaching factories,\" providing hands-on factory workforce training for the relevant technology-- for example, NC State, the lead for Power America, has created a Master's of Science concentration focused on wide band gap semiconductor power electronics. More than 200 graduate students at NC State and member universities of Power America are now studying power electronics each year. As a result, over 225 freshman engineering students have been introduced to wide band gap semiconductors, building a talent pipeline of future graduates.\n•      Business Opportunities: By developing national expertise across their supply chains, the institutes are creating new reasons for companies to locate jobs and investment in their regions and the United States—for example, Leisure Pools, a polymer composite pool manufacturer originally from Australia, has relocated its facilities to be near the Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) in Knoxville, TN, as Leisure Pool moves into new areas to become an advanced manufacturer of carbon fiber composite material products and adds up to 1,000 jobs in Knoxville over the next decade.\n•      Innovation Ecosystems: The institutes are creating trusted environments, knitting together technical expertise across supply chains to craft new business opportunities—for example, the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII) in Chicago, IL is providing space within its facilities for start-ups developing their business, facilitating relationships between young companies and large industrial members through collaborative projects.\n•      Rejuvenated Neighborhoods: By anchoring regional manufacturing competitiveness, the institutes are breathing new life into the manufacturing regions where they are located—for example, Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT), the lightweight and modern metals manufacturing institute in Detroit, MI, has transformed a former factory that was abandoned during the wave of offshoring in the early 2000s, rejuvenating one of Detroit's oldest neighborhoods.\nTo learn more about the open competitions for these next manufacturing innovation institutes, please visit Manufacturing.gov. In addition to today's announcement, the established manufacturing innovation institutes are:\n•      America Makes, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (Youngstown, OH)\n•      Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (Chicago, IL)\n•      Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (Detroit, MI)\n•      Power America (Raleigh, NC)\n•      Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (Knoxville, TN)\n•      American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (Rochester, NY)\n•      Next Flex, the Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Innovation Institute (San Jose, CA)\n•      Advanced Functional Fabrics of America (Cambridge, MA)\n•      Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (Los Angeles, CA)\n•      Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment (New York, NY)\n•      National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (Newark, DE)", "timestamp": "2016-12-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces New Manufacturing USA Institute, Third Institute Awarded in Three Weeks"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This memorandum was published in the  Federal Register  on December 28.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119944", "text": "Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\nSubject: Supporting New American Service Members, Veterans, and Their Families\nMy Administration has maintained a steadfast commitment to honor and serve the brave men and women who have served this country. Like all service members and veterans, foreign-born residents and naturalized citizens serving in the United States Armed Forces are shining examples of the American dream. These brave new Americans have taken the extraordinary step of answering the call to duty, to support and defend our country. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country before becoming American citizens.\nNew American service members are undoubtedly a critical element of our national security. They risk their lives all over the world in the name of the United States, securing shipping lanes, protecting bases and embassies, providing medical assistance, and conducting humanitarian missions. Tens of thousands of lawful permanent residents and naturalized U.S. citizens currently serve in our Armed Forces. Many more are veterans who have served previously in the Armed Forces. Additionally, many U.S.-born service members have immediate family members who were born abroad.\nOver the past decade, the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security have strengthened partnerships to provide services and opportunities to service members, veterans, and their families interacting with the U.S. immigration system. Indeed, since 2001, more than 110,000 service members have been naturalized and many were assisted in the process through partnerships such as the \"Naturalization at Basic Training Initiative,\" which gives non-citizen enlistees the opportunity to naturalize during basic training. Despite these efforts, service members, veterans, and their families still face barriers to accessing immigration benefits and other assistance for which they may be eligible.\nIn light of the sacrifices that all of these individuals make and have made for our country, it is critical that executive departments and agencies (agencies) enhance collaboration and streamline processes to ensure that they receive the services and benefits they need and have earned. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to address the issues facing new American service members, veterans, and their families, I hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1.  Interagency Working Group to Support New American Service Members, Veterans, and their Families. There is established a Working Group to Support New American Service Members, Veterans, and their Families (Working Group) to coordinate records, benefits, and immigration and citizenship services for these service members, veterans, and their families. The Working Group shall convene its first meeting within 10 days of the date of this memorandum.\n(a) The Working Group shall consist of representatives from:\n(i) the Department of State;\n(ii) the Department of Defense; (iii) the Department of Justice;\n(iv) the Department of Labor;\n(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n(vi) the Department of Homeland Security.\n(b) The Working Group shall consult with additional agencies or offices, as appropriate.\nSec. 2. Mission and Functions of the Working Group. (a) The Working Group shall coordinate agency efforts to support service members, veterans, and their families who are navigating the immigration, veterans, and military systems. Such efforts shall include:\n(i) coordinating the sharing of military records and other information relevant to immigration or veterans benefits;\n(ii) enhancing awareness of naturalization and immigration benefits to provide timely assistance and information to service members, veterans, and their families;\n(iii) coordinating and facilitating the process of adjudicating immigration applications and petitions; and\n(iv) other efforts that further support service members, veterans, and their families.\n(b) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Working Group shall develop an initial 3-year strategic action plan that details broad approaches to be taken to enhance access to services and benefits. This initial plan shall be supplemented by a more detailed plan, to be published within 120 days of the date of this memorandum that discusses the steps to be taken in greater detail. The Working Group shall also report periodically on its accomplishments and ongoing initiatives.\nSec. 3. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives of this memorandum and applicable law, the Working Group shall seek the views of representatives of private and nonprofit organizations; veterans and military service organizations; State, tribal, and local government agencies; elected officials; and other interested persons to inform the Working Group's plans.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) The heads of agencies shall assist and provide information to the Working Group, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Working Group. Each agency and office shall bear its own expense for carrying out activities related to the Working Group.\n(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority granted by law to an executive department or an agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government.\n(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(e) The Secretary of Homeland Security is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-22", "title": "Memorandum on Supporting New American Servicemembers, Veterans, and Their Families"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121388", "text": "MR. PRICE: Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining the call on relatively short notice here. We wanted to provide an opportunity to provide a little more context and answer your questions on today's action in U.N. Security Council.\nWe have three speakers on today's call, which will be on the record but embargoed until the conclusion of the call. We have Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications. We have Rob Malley, the White House Coordinator for Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf. And we have Frank Lowenstein, who is the Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations at the State Department.\nSo again, this call is on the record but it is embargoed until the conclusion. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben.\nMR. RHODES: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. I won't give a lengthy opening statement just because Samantha Power's explanation both I think comprehensively captures the United States' view and our decision to, again, abstain and allow for the passage of the U.N. Security Council resolution that makes clear that both Israel and the Palestinians have to take steps to preserve the two-state solution, a resolution that expresses the consensus international view on Israeli settlement activity, as well as condemning violence, terrorism, and incitement.\nI'd just give a few points before we get into your questions. First of all, President Obama, of course, communicated his decision for the United States to take this action after several rounds of discussions with Ambassador Rice, Ambassador Power, Secretary Kerry, and members of his national security team. We have been following the development by different parties of a variety of resolutions at the United Nations, as we often do, over the course of the year. And this, of course, is the one that emerged in recent days and was put forward by the Egyptians yesterday, and counted the votes today.\nI'd just make a number of comments at the top. First of all, this is consistent with longstanding bipartisan U.S. policy as it relates to settlements, as it relates to our opposition to Israeli settlements, as it relates to our opposition to, and condemnation of, incitement and violence and terrorism, and, above all, about our affirmative support for a two-state solution.\nAnd one of our grave concerns is that the continued pace of settlement activity -- which has accelerated in recent years, which has accelerated significantly since 2011, when we vetoed the U.N. Security Council resolution that condemns settlements -- puts at risk the two-state solution, as does any continued incitement to violence. And we've been very concerned that these accelerating trends are putting the very viability of a two-state solution at risk. And in that context, we therefore thought that we could not in good conscience veto a resolution that expressed concerns about the very trends that are eroding the foundation for a two-state solution.\nThe second thing I would say is that it is -- again, not only has it been the consistent policy under bipartisan U.S. administrations to oppose settlement activity, it has also been consistently the case that U.S. administrations have addressed the Israeli-Palestinian issue, or the broader Arab-Israeli issue, through the U.N. Security Council. In fact, President Obama was, until this resolution, the first President in decades to not have such a resolution go forward during his time in office.\nThe third thing that I would say just by way of opening is that we, as Samantha Power said, do have concerns about the U.N. as a venue for addressing aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That is why, for instance, we have consistently resisted efforts to impose a solution to the conflict through the United Nations, through the drawing of borders, or the recognition of a Palestinian state. What this resolution does, again, is condemn the settlement activity as well as incitement and violence, which are steps that we believe are consistent with having a basis in the future for there to be a return to the negotiating table in pursuit of a two-state solution.\nBut let's be clear here: We exhausted every effort to pursue a two-state solution through negotiations, through direct discussions, through proximity discussions, through confidence-building measures, through a lengthy and exhaustive effort undertaken by Secretary Kerry earlier in the President's second term. We gave every effort that we could to supporting the parties coming to the table.\nSo within the absence of any meaningful peace process, as well as in the face of accelerated settlement activity that put at risk the viability of a two-state solution, that we took the decision that we did today to abstain on this resolution.\nWith that, I'm sure you have many questions. So, operator, we'd be happy to shift to questions. And again, I'm joined by Frank and Rob here, and so the three of us can handle questions.\nQ Thanks very much. Thanks to all of you. To Ben or Rob or whoever, Frank -- Donald Trump just tweeted, \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20.\" And a senior Israeli official told NBC News today -- said, \"President Obama and Secretary Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the U.N. The U.S. administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel's back, which would be a tailwind for terror and boycotts, and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory.\" So I wanted to see if you could react to Trump's tweet, the very strong language out of Israel, and whether you think it is confusing to have the President-elect getting this directly involved with Egypt, Israel and the U.N., as well as Russia, and the other things that have happened before he is sworn in.\nMR. RHODES: So thanks, Andrea, for the question. On the President-elect, the first thing I'd just say is that there's one President at a time. President Obama is the President of the United States until January 20th, and we are taking this action, of course, as U.S. policy. And as I also said, this has been longstanding bipartisan U.S. policy to oppose this type of settlement activity going forward.\nWith respect to the quote you read, it's full of inaccuracies and falsehoods. Let me just step back and put this in context for a moment. President Obama has done more for Israel and its security than any previous U.S. President. We just recently signed with Israel the single largest U.S. military assistance package in history -- $38 billion over the coming decade. That comes after an administration in which we provided lifesaving assistance for the Iron Dome Missile Defense System. We've achieved what Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has described as unprecedented security cooperation between our military and intelligence officials. We have repeatedly stood up for Israel in international fora in a variety of different ways, whether it was opposing efforts to address final status issues through the United Nations, or supporting greater Israeli integration into international fora.\nSo I believe that despite what has at times been very strident Israeli government criticism of U.S. policies that President Obama has always made Israel and its security sacrosanct in his approach to these issues. In fact, we've always said that our pursuit of a two-state solution is guided in part by our belief that that is the only way to preserve and strengthen Israel's security in the long run, and to achieve the goal that we share with the Israeli people of having a state of Israel that is both Jewish and democratic in nature.\nAll of that said, with this criticism it seems like the Israeli government wants the conversation to be about anything other than the settlement activity. And the fact of the matter is, as you heard Samantha say, since 2009, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank has increased by more than 100,000 to nearly 400,000. There's been an increase of more than 15,000 in the last year alone. Since 2009, construction has begun on over 12,700 new settlement units in the West Bank. There are now nearly 900,000 -- I'm sorry, 90,000 settlers living east of the separation barrier that was created by Israel itself. And the population of these distant settlements has grown by 20,000 since 2009.\nSo this is not simply a matter of construction within the so-called blocks, within what has long been considered the likely borders of a future -- within a future peace agreement. We have acknowledged publicly that there will have to be an acknowledgement of the growth since the 1967 lines were established as a part of any future peace agreement. But in fact, what we've seen is much more accelerated settlement construction. And now the total settler population in the West Bank and East Jerusalem exceeds 590,000.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu recently described his own government as \"more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history.\" Those are his words. And we're concerned about these trends. We were concerned after our election, when one of his leading coalition partners, Naftali Bennett, declared that \"the era of the two-state solution is over.\"\nSo, for us, the question here has always been about what is the best way to pursue the security that the Israeli people deserve. And we cannot simply have a two-state solution be a slogan while the trend lines on the ground are such that a two-state solution is becoming less and less viable.\nI would add that we've repeatedly condemned incitement to violence by Palestinians. We've repeatedly condemned Palestinian terrorism. We have stood up for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket fire from Gaza, even when we were one of the only countries in the world that was taking that position. So we've been willing time and again to support Israel in international fora, just as we've supported Israel's right to defend itself, by itself, and just as we've ensured through our assistance that Israel will maintain its qualitative military edge for the enduring future.\nSo, again, President Obama's track record on Israel's security is clear. Anybody can review it. But, in fact, I'd take umbrage at language that suggests that this was our preferred course of action and that we initiated it. The fact of the matter is, we'd been warning -- President Obama and Secretary Kerry publicly and privately for years -- that the trend line of settlement construction and settlement activity was just increasing Israel's international isolation. This is not a new position for us; we've been saying that for many, many, many years. Secretary Kerry, as Frank can attest to, has had hundreds of conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We've made precisely this point.\nAnd with respect to this resolution, we did not draft this resolution; we did not introduce this resolution. The Egyptians, in partnership with the Palestinians, are the ones who began circulating an earlier draft of the resolution. The Egyptians are the ones who moved it forward yesterday. And we took the position that we did when it was put to a vote.\nQ Thanks, Ben and Ned, and everybody for doing this. It doesn't seem as if necessarily that this is -- you're talking about a bipartisan position against settlement activity, and that's well understood. But when Chuck Schumer was calling you guys this morning, he was saying it's not about the fact that I endorse settlement activity; obviously, I think that settlement activity is contrary to the pursuit of peace and all of that -- it's the way in which you guys are going about this that it's counterproductive or it's not going to get the results that you seek. And so I don't really understand what you think this accomplishes and how you account for the position you're putting the President-elect in to somehow reverse course or to make up for this action that has just been taken.\nJust the last thing, Paul Ryan obviously just came out with a statement saying that this is absolutely shameful, which of course, you disagree with, but the actionable point he made is we are going to take steps to reverse course. So why would you put the incoming administration into a position where they have to sort of make up for this action?\nMR. RHODES: So, Michael, on the second point, I think it would be absurd to suggest that this action is in some way related at all to policy positions that the incoming administration has already said that they will pursue. In other words, before this resolution was even being discussed publicly, the incoming administration announced their intention to move our embassy to Jerusalem. And I think they've sent a very clear message about what their approach to this issue is going to be through the person that they selected as their ambassador nominee. That tells you what you need to know about the position of the incoming administration, and I think it would be, frankly, ignoring those very clear facts and statements that are available to everybody to see to suggest that somehow this resolution informs those positions. Those positions were taken before this resolution was even being discussed at all publicly.\nThe second point I'd make is that we have great respect for Senator Schumer and for a number of members of Congress of both parties who I recognize took a different view from us. What I'd say as it relates to your question, though, is, where is the evidence that not doing this is slowing the settlement construction? We've tried a different approach for years here. We vetoed a resolution in 2011 that condemned settlement activity, and yet what we've seen since then is an acceleration of the settlement activity.\nSo the notion that vetoing this resolution would have somehow slowed the settlement activity I think flies in the face of any piece of evidence that anybody who is looking at the facts can see. These are facts. The construction of settlements can be counted and documented. Palestinians being displaced from their homes -- that can be documented. The statements of this Israeli government, that they are \"more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history,\" that is something that was said before this resolution passed the United Nations Security Council.\nSo, again, while I understand and respect the different points of view on the issue, I would just suggest that we have a body of evidence to assess how this Israeli government has responded to us not taking this kind of action, and that suggests that they will continue to accelerate the type of settlement construction that puts a two-state solution at risk. Whereas here we are at least trying to establish that the international community is on the record in reaffirming its own longstanding position against settlement construction and against incitement and against terrorism, because we believe that those are, again, important principles that could guide any future return to the negotiating table.\nAnd again, just the last thing I'd say is that if you look at this resolution as against the resolution in 2011, it is more balanced. There is a more direct condemnation of violence and incitement of violence, and a call upon leaders to reject incitement to violence. So we felt that that balance is also very important, because we completely understand that the conflict is not purely about settlements. It has to be about whether or not Palestinian leaders are taking the necessary steps to reject incitement, to condemn incitement, to reject terrorism, to reject rocket fire to individual citizens of Israel. And I think if you look at our track record, it's consistent in that regard.\nWe've supported Israeli efforts to defend themselves against rocket fire. We've condemned terrorism. We've condemned incitement. We've opposed previous one-sided resolutions that did not have the balance that was in this resolution. And we've opposed efforts to impose a solution through the U.N. Security Council.\nQ Thanks for doing this, guys. I'm just wondering, Ben, whether there are still any plans for the President to maybe give a speech or lay down a vision of parameters or some sort of a framework for future negotiations. Settlements are obviously part of the equation, but they're only a small part, and also for the administration, a part that has generally been the most contentious. I'm wondering, does the President recognize the need to offer sort of a more cohesive vision of what a two-state solution would look like and the road to get to that, to get to that kind of agreement before he leaves office?\nMR. RHODES: Sure -- and Frank will want to speak to this. But Secretary Kerry will be providing, informed by his enormous and tireless work, a comprehensive vision. We completely agree with the point that this conflict is about far more than settlements. And so, Frank, you may want to speak to that.\nMR. LOWENSTEIN: Yeah, no, I think it's a very important point, Mark, and thanks for raising it. The Secretary has obviously put a great deal of time and effort over the course of the last four years to negotiations (inaudible) between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and then, since then, to really innumerable conversations, not only with the parties but also with key players in the region and other stakeholders around the world. And out of that, I think he's got some ideas about where we go from here. And I know he looks forward to sharing them sometime in the days ahead.\nQ Hi, thanks for doing this. You obviously, clearly, have very strong feelings about this. I'm wondering why go with the split-the-middle choice of an abstention. Also, do you see this as something more than symbolic? What follow-through will there be to actually in any way stop Israeli settlements? And do you have any kind of response to Senator Graham who said he's going to cut funding to the U.N. and basically punish anyone who voted for it?\nMR. RHODES: Sure, Margaret. So, on your first point, look, we abstained, as Samantha explained, for a number of reasons. First, the United Nations, we continue to believe, is a flawed venue for this issue in that it has frequently been used to single out Israel, often through completely over-the-top exercises, that -- again, when it comes to final status issues, we believe that those should be negotiated between the parties.\nSo, for instance, there have been many different resolutions kicking around over the course of the last year. We would not have supported or abstained from voting on a parameters resolution. We would have vetoed any resolution that we thought sought to impose a solution that sought to impose a view on the final status issue.\nSo, again, I think an abstention reflects the reality that we don't want to suggest that the United Nations should be used for efforts beyond this one to address final status issues, or to recognize a Palestinian state, or to endorse a set of parameters.\nOn the narrow question of the resolution that was put in front of us, we saw a resolution that in large part was consistent with U.S. policy. And that, combined with the trend lines I spoke of, informed our decision.\nWe also abstained because while there was balance, as I discussed, in that the resolution addressed and condemned violence and incitement of violence, we thought that that could have been more prominent in the resolution; that there was more time devoted to addressing Israeli activities than the type of violence and incitement that we've seen. And so, again, it did not, in terms of the weight of emphasis on the different issues -- it was not sufficiently elevating at length the issues that we care very deeply about. We're pleased that that was included, but again, when you see horrifying knife attacks, when you see continued incitement to violence, you see continued anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic slogans and calls for violence from with the Palestinian Territories, that gravely concerns us. And that's an enormous obstacle to peace, of course.\nSo again, that explains that abstention, those two issues -- the U.N. as a future venue for final status issues, given its history, and the emphasis in this resolution being more focused on Israeli activity than some of the concerning activities that are addressed in the resolution with respect to the Palestinians but I think could have been addressed at greater length.\nWith respect to U.N. funding, whenever this issue comes up, the United States would only be hurting itself by seeking to hurt the United Nations. We work through the United Nations to do an enormous range of activities that are very important to our own national security interests -- to provide life-saving assistance, to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis. So if we were to cut funding for the United Nations in response to this resolution, all we would be doing is hurting other people, hurting our own interests, and, frankly, it doesn't make a lot of sense to do that, particularly given to your last point.\nLook, this is a statement, an affirmation of the view of the international community. That's what it is. You are correct that it does not -- it is not something that is going to impose a consequence beyond affirming that view of the international community. And so, in that regard, we felt that given that, that's our view and that's been a longstanding view of this administration and the international community that we could abstain from this and allow this resolution to go forward.\nQ Hi, thanks for doing this. First question -- Frank, I want to follow up to what you just said about Kerry's speech, upcoming speech. Is he basically going to make the March 2014 framework paper public and basically tell us what it included? And second question to Ben: I know you've been planning this for eight years now, trying to promote the peace process with Netanyahu. And it's very interesting for me and I guess for others to really try and understand your final conclusion after eight years. Do you believe that, at the end of the day, after all those years, your conclusion is that Netanyahu wants to promote a two-state solution? Or was that just a talking point all those last eight years?\nMR. LOWENSTEIN: Thanks, Barack, I'll take your first part of that question first. No, the Secretary will not be making the March 2014 framework public. That was a private negotiation with the parties, and he will absolutely respect that.\nI think what you'll hear in his remarks -- and I don't want to go into too much detail -- but I think he will draw on his experiences, as I said, directly with the parties and also with others over the course of the last four years.\nMR. RHODES: And on your second question, Barack, look, I think a first point that's very important is that Prime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today. Absent this acceleration of settlement activity, absent the type of rhetoric we've seen out of the current Israeli government, I think the United States likely would have taken a different view, because our preference is for there to be a credible peace process underway.\nSo, again, it's very important that this -- the fact that this is happening towards the end of our eight years indicates that this is not our preferred course of action and that we've given years and years and years of opportunities to address issues related to the settlements or to address issues related to the peace process that, frankly, we believe could have been more productive. And, frankly, President Obama, if you look at speech after speech that he gave, kept warning that the trends in the conflict were going to lead to greater international efforts to apply pressure in Israel; that the settlement activity was going to lead to greater national efforts to apply pressure to Israel.\nThere's a huge record on this, and I think it's very unfair and inaccurate to suggest that somehow this was an outcome that we sought. If it was an outcome that we sought, we would have done this long ago. But the fact is, we were compelled to because of the choices that have been made over years by the Israeli government in building settlements and not taking different opportunities that were presented for a credible peace process.\nI should add that the Palestinians also failed to take opportunities. As Frank and Rob know well, Secretary Kerry's effort did not move forward because of the decisions by both Israelis and Palestinians. So I just want to be very clear here that the Palestinians have missed plenty of opportunities under this administration as well.\nOn your second part of your question, look, all I can say is that we've tried everything. We've tried proximity talks, we've tried direct talks, we've tried the Secretary of State who dove into this and made it an enormous priority for a long period of time. We've tried to step back. And the one consistent outcome was that it didn't work. We can go back and look at what we did differently, but at the end of the day, precisely because we believe this can only be resolved in negotiations, it's up to the parties to show that they're serious about those negotiations and that talking about a peace process isn't just a phrase -- it's an actual, meaningful, diplomatic effort to try to achieve a resolution.\nAnd I think Samantha's vote explanation says it best, which is that we hear the words about a two-state solution, and then we see the actions that are making a two-state solution far less likely, if not out of reach. And at a certain point, the words and the actions become irreconcilable. And that's what we're concerned about. And we believe that that would be not in the best interest of Israel. And precisely because President Obama cares so deeply about Israel and its security, he would like to see a return to a meaningful effort to pursue peace.\nQ I wanted to ask Ben how much influence Donald Trump's positions -- his choice of ambassador, you talked about that a little bit earlier -- but how much did that have an effect on the President's decision in terms of whether or not it made it more likely for him to make the decision that he did? And did he tell anyone in advance, either the Israelis or any lawmakers, before he made this decision? And then if you could clarify just two on his decision-making -- when he made the decision on this particular resolution, and then, more broadly, kind of when he decided in principle that this was something he would do.\nMR. RHODES: So he communicated his decision today to Ambassador Rice. The fact is, we didn't know what resolution was going to come to a vote until late morning today. So he did not communicate his decision until that point.\nI think as this resolution emerged from the Egyptians yesterday, we were preparing to make a decision, and then we had the drama yesterday. What we've said consistently is that the settlement-related UNSCRs circulate, and we have always been clear that we would want to look at any resolution on its own merits and that we would want to assess whether it had balance and whether it avoided seeking to impose a solution. And so we had to see whether this resolution would meet that criteria.\nWith respect to the President-elect, look, we made this decision based on our assessment of the trend lines on the ground, recent incitement, recent settlement activity, our concern that a two-state solution was being put at risk by the trend lines on the ground. So that's the basis under which we made our decision.\nI only mentioned the President-elect's statements and appointments in response to the notion that this might shape their actions. Again, my point is simply that I think they've been quite clear and quite specific about their intentions and their policies, and that simply pre-dates this resolution.\nAnd, again, I do just want to be very clear because it has come up in a couple of the questions, including Andrea's: When the Egyptians began circulating this resolution, we did not indicate to any U.N. member how we would vote on the resolution. In fact, I think part of the reason why there seemed to be some suspense -- even when Samantha was sitting in the room -- is because we had not been indicating how we would vote, in part because we recognized that drafts could change. And so until we knew exactly what the draft was and how we would vote on it, we weren't going to express the view.\nSo the notion that we were somehow involved in drafting this is just not true. This is something that the Egyptians were pursuing with other members of the council. Now, those members of the council, they hear our views on this issue all the time, but again, I think we maintained ambiguity about how we would vote precisely because of what we saw yesterday, which is we didn't know exactly what resolution was going to emerge.\nWhat we always do is make clear that any resolution that fails to reflect our concerns about issues like incitement and violence and terrorism would be subject to a U.S. veto. And so that's a principle that I think was understood by other members of the council.\nAgain, after this Egyptian draft was put in blue on Wednesday evening, the President convened a call with senior members of his national security team, including the Vice President, Secretary Kerry, Ambassador Rice, Ambassador Power and others. And again, he, in that decision, was open to abstaining, though we had to wait and see what would emerge. And again, after the drama of yesterday, we wanted to wait and see whether the resolution would change or not. So that's why he had to communicate his final decision to Susan today.\nSo, again, I just want to -- it's important that the record reflects that we were responding to efforts at the U.N. Security Council up until even this morning.\nQ Hey, Ben, thanks again for doing the call. Hoping you can -- we know that President-elect Trump and President Obama spoke on Monday, per the President-elect, and that the President-elect's team said that they provided the White House notice yesterday before releasing their statement calling for a veto of a version of this resolution. Could you provide any -- were there any conversations between the President and the President-elect about this since Monday? Or when they talked Monday, was it about this? And any communication between the White House and the President-elect or his staff between when the President made his decision and when the vote took place?\nMR. RHODES: So I'm not aware that President Obama and the President-elect spoke about this, but again, I'm not -- President Obama definitely made no reference to that, so I can't confirm that this hasn't come up at all, but I'm not aware of any particular conversation they had about this.\nWe did hear from the President-elect's team. Again, our position has been there's one President at a time. We're going to make our decision on this and, frankly, believe that it's important that there's a principle here that the world understands who is speaking on behalf of the United States until January 20th and who is speaking on behalf of the United States after January 20th.\nAnd look, the new team will have every opportunity after January 20th to pursue their own policies, to take different approaches. I'm certain that they will on any number of issues. We're just reflecting the simple principle that I think has guided the President-elect transitions historically, which is that there is one President at a time and we're going to execute our duties until the new team is in place and the new President is inaugurated.\nOkay, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. And we'll be available for any additional inquiries.", "timestamp": "2016-12-23", "title": "On-the-Record Press Call by Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, Rob Malley, White House Coordinator for Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf, and Frank Lowenstein, Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations at the State Department on the U.N.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "S. 2943, approved December 23, was assigned Public Law No. 114-328.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119931", "text": "Today, I have signed into law S. 2943, the \"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\" This Act authorizes fiscal year 2017 appropriations principally for the Department of Defense and for Department of Energy national security programs, provides vital benefits for military personnel and their families, and includes authorities to facilitate ongoing operations around the globe. It continues many critical authorizations necessary to ensure that we are able to sustain our momentum in countering the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and to reassure our European allies, as well as many new authorizations that, among other things, provide the Departments of Defense and Energy more flexibility in countering cyber-attacks and our adversaries' use of unmanned aerial vehicles.\nI note that section 923 of the Act requires that the President establish a unified combatant command for cyber operations forces, while section 1642 prohibits the Secretary of Defense from terminating the \"dual-hat\" arrangement under which the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) also serves as the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), unless the Secretary and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff jointly certify that ending this arrangement will not pose risks to the military effectiveness of CYBERCOM that are unacceptable to the national security interests of the United States. Although I appreciate the Congress's interest in strengthening our Nation's cyber capabilities and ensuring that the NSA and CYBERCOM are best positioned to confront the array of cyber threats we face, I do not support these provisions as drafted: the Congress should leave decisions about the establishment of combatant commands to the executive branch and should not place unnecessary and bureaucratic administrative burdens and conditions on ending the dual-hat arrangement at a time when the speed and nature of cyber threats requires agility in making decisions about how best to organize and manage the Nation's cyber capabilities. That said, after directing a comprehensive review of this issue earlier this year, and consistent with the views of the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, I strongly support elevating CYBERCOM to a unified combatant command and ending the dual-hat arrangement for NSA and CYBERCOM—a position my Administration has communicated to the incoming Administration. While the dual-hat arrangement was once appropriate in order to enable a fledgling CYBERCOM to leverage NSA's advanced capabilities and expertise, CYBERCOM has since matured and the current construct should be replaced through a deliberate, conditions-based approach to separating the organizations. The two organizations should have separate leaders who are able to devote themselves to each organization's respective mission and responsibilities, but should continue to leverage the shared capabilities and synergies developed under the dual-hat arrangement. To these ends, the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have taken steps to ensure that separation would occur in a phased manner that enables NSA to continue to provide vital operational support to CYBERCOM during a transition period.\nBeyond these provisions, I remain deeply concerned about the Congress's use of the National Defense Authorization Act to impose extensive organizational changes on the Department of Defense, disregarding the advice of the Department's senior civilian and uniformed leaders. The extensive changes in the bill are rushed, the consequences poorly understood, and they come at a particularly inappropriate time as we undertake a transition between administrations. These changes not only impose additional administrative burdens on the Department of Defense and make it less agile, but they also create additional bureaucracies and operational restrictions that generate inefficiencies at a time when we need to be more efficient.\nMy Administration has similar concerns with the Administrative Leave Act, which would limit the period of time for which an employee of the Federal Government may be put on administrative leave. The provision substantially limits Federal agencies' discretion and is administratively burdensome, raising the risk of harm to the safety of Government employees and the risk of loss or damage to Government properties. Further, for the Intelligence Community, the Act creates unacceptable counterintelligence and security risks.\nI am also disappointed that the Congress again failed to enact meaningful reforms to divest unneeded force structure, reduce wasteful overhead, and modernize military healthcare. Instead, the Congress redirects funding needed to support the warfighter to fund additional end-strength that our military leaders have not requested at a time when our troops are engaged overseas supporting the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and against al-Qa'ida. This approach hides the long-term costs of the Congress's authorizations, imposes significant costs in FY 2017 and substantially more over the next 5 years, and exacerbates the budgetary pressures already facing our military. Increasing force structure without adequate funding support in the base budget is dangerous; it will degrade, not enhance, readiness and modernization, contrary to our senior civilian and military leaders' priorities.\nOnce again, the Congress has also failed to take action toward closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As I have said before, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, year after year, to keep fewer than sixty men in an isolated detention facility in Cuba is not consistent with our interests as a Nation and undermines our standing in the world. It weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.\nIn February, my Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility. Rather than answer that call and work with my Administration to finally bring this chapter of our history to a close, this bill aims to make the facility a permanent feature of our struggle against terrorism. During my Administration, we have responsibly transferred over 175 detainees from Guantanamo, and the population once held at the facility has now been reduced from 242 to 59. In the last 2 years, we have transferred 73 detainees, and our efforts to transfer additional detainees will continue until the last day I am in office. It is long past time for the Congress to lift the restrictions it has imposed, work to responsibly and safely close the facility, and remove this blot on our national honor. Unless the Congress changes course, it will be judged harshly by history.\nAs I have said in the past, the restrictions contained in this bill concerning the detention facility at Guantanamo are unwarranted and counterproductive. In particular, section 1033 renews the bar against using appropriated funds to construct or modify any facility in the United States, its territories, or possessions to house any Guantanamo detainee in the custody or under the control of the Department of Defense unless authorized by the Congress. Section 1032 also renews the bar against using appropriated funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose. The bill leaves in place onerous restrictions on the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, and section 1034 imposes additional restrictions on foreign transfers of detainees—in some cases purporting to bar such transfers entirely.\nAs I have said repeatedly, the provisions in this bill concerning detainee transfers would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. Additionally, section 1034 could in some circumstances interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus. In the event that the restrictions on the transfer of detainees in sections 1032 and 1034 operate in a manner that violates these constitutional principles, my Administration will implement them in a manner that avoids the constitutional conflict.\nMy Administration strongly supports the bill's structural reform of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which streamlines BBG operations and reduces inefficiencies, while retaining the longstanding statutory firewall, protecting against interference with and maintaining the professional independence of the agency's journalists and broadcasters and thus their credibility as sources of independent news and information. Section 1288 would elevate the current Chief Executive Officer of the Broadcasting Board of Governors to the head of the agency and reduce the current members of the Board, unless on expired terms, from serving as the collective head of the agency to serving as advisors to the Chief Executive Officer. While my Administration supports the empowerment of a Chief Executive Officer with the authority to carry out the BBG's important functions, the manner of transition prescribed by section 1288 raises constitutional concerns related to my appointments and removal authority. My Administration will devise a plan to treat this provision in a manner that mitigates the constitutional concerns while adhering closely to the Congress's intent.\nSeveral other provisions in the bill also raise constitutional concerns.\nFirst, section 507 of the bill would authorize certain cabinet officials to \"drop from the rolls\" military officers without my approval. The Constitution does not allow Congress to authorize other members of the executive branch to remove presidentially appointed officers, so I will direct my cabinet members to construe the statute as permitting them to remove the commission of a military officer only if the officer accepts their decision or I approve the removal.\nSecond, section 553 of the bill would establish a commission, composed primarily of members appointed by the Congress, in the executive branch. Because the commission contains legislative branch appointees, it cannot be located in the executive branch consistent with the separation of powers. My Administration will therefore treat the commission as an independent entity, separate from the executive branch.\nFinally, section 1263(d) purports to require me to determine whether a foreign person has committed a sanctionable human rights violation when I receive a request to do so from certain members of Congress. Consistent with the constitutional separation of powers, which limit the Congress's ability to dictate how the executive branch executes the law, I will maintain my discretion to decline to act on such requests when appropriate.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nDecember 23, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-12-23", "title": "Statement on Signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017"}

Well, I know Santa knows that you've been a good girl --\nRILEY'S MOM: Good boy.\nMRS. OBAMA: (Laughter.) Well, here's the thing that I know, Riley. If you want Santa to get to your house, you know what you have to do?\nRILEY'S MOM: What do you have to do, bud?\nRILEY: Be good!\nMRS. OBAMA: You have to be good and you have to go to bed when your mommy tells you to. I know it's exciting, but Santa won't come until you close your eyes and you're fast asleep, okay?\nRILEY: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. Well, you have a very merry, merry Christmas, okay?\nRILEY: Okay. Merry Christmas!\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you, sweetie. All right, you all take care. And bless you, guys -- have a great day tomorrow.\nRILEY'S MOM: Merry Christmas! We love you guys!\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you so much. You guys are awesome.\n***\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi, April! It's Michelle Obama, the First Lady. How you doing?\nAPRIL: I'm doing good. How about yourself?\nMRS. OBAMA: I'm doing really well. It's one of my favorite nights of the whole year -- I get to help NORAD track Santa for kids like you guys, who are trying to find out where he is, right?\nAPRIL: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: How old are you, April?\nAPRIL: I'm 13.\nMRS. OBAMA: You're 13 -- awesome! What grade are you in?\nAPRIL: I'm in seventh grade.\nMRS. OBAMA: Seventh grade -- so is that middle school for you now?\nAPRIL: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: How are you liking it? How's it going?\nAPRIL: It's going good.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's good. You doing well in school? You enjoy it?\nAPRIL: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's good. Well, you're probably going to have a pretty good Christmas, aren't you?\nAPRIL: Yes, I am.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, I'm looking at the radar tracker right now, and I'm looking at this time -- I see a little dot on the radar screen, it's showing -- yes, it's showing Santa with his reindeer leading him. And he's flying fast. He's delivered over 3 million gifts so far. And right now he looks to be still flying over Sardinia, Italy. He's all the way in Europe right now. So he's moving pretty fast, and he's heading your way. But you know he's not going to get there until you go to sleep so it's your job to listen to your parents and get a good night's sleep so that when you wake up in the morning, Santa can make sure you've gotten all the gifts that you deserve this year. You ready for that?\nAPRIL: Yes, ma'am.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. Well, you shut your eyes and have a great night's sleep, and I know you're going to have a very special day tomorrow because you sound like a pretty special young lady.\nAPRIL: Thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay, well, merry Christmas to you and your entire family, okay?\nAPRIL: Okay. Merry Christmas!\nMRS. OBAMA: All right, take care, sweetie. Bye-bye.\nAPRIL: Bye!\n***\nMRS. OBAMA: Hello! This is Michelle Obama, the First Lady. I hear I've got four excited little kids on the phone. Who am I talking to?\nMOM: Hey! We've got Ely and Austin and Ava and Lily here.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh my goodness! What a crew you have, mom! How you holding up?\nMOM: Good! Two of them are mine and two of them are my niece and nephew. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, okay! All right, all right, now I feel better for you. (Laughter.) You've got a big crew over there, just like us. We've got about 15 kids in this house with us right now. (Laughter.) Well, who is going to be the spokesperson?\nMOM: Austin, Eli, do you guys want to come over here? You've got to talk!\nMRS. OBAMA: Hey, guys!\nAUSTIN: Hi, Santa?\nMRS. OBAMA: How you doing? This is Michelle Obama -- I'm the First Lady. And on Christmas Eve, I love helping NORAD help you guys find Santa.\nAUSTIN: What time is Santa going to be here?\nAUSTIN'S MOM: Can you say merry Christmas?\nAUSTIN AND ELY: Merry Christmas, sweetie. Are you guys excited for tomorrow?\nAUSTIN: What time will Santa be here?\nAUSTIN'S MOM: Say yes.\nAUSTIN: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, let's help you find out where Santa is. I'm looking at the satellite tracker and I'm -- oh my gosh! I can see it on the radar.\nAUSTIN: Do you see Santa?\nMRS. OBAMA: I see Santa in his sleigh. It's a big red sleigh and it's full of toys. And I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight reindeer, and another to lead -- that is Rudolph! He's pulling -- he's leading the whole pack.\nAUSTIN: Rudolph is leading the sleigh tonight!\nMRS. OBAMA: He is! Rudolph is leading the sleigh, and his red nose is glowing. It's so exciting. Well, you know where they are right now? They are --\nAUSTIN: We don't --\nMRS. OBAMA: What, sweetie?\nAUSTIN: We don't see him.\nAUSTIN'S MOM: We'll find a picture. I promise.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, if you go on to the website, you'll be able to see them flying. But right now, at this time, Santa is flying over a place called Corsica, France. He's all the way in Europe!\nAUSTIN'S MOM: He's in France right now! How cool is that?\nAUSTIN: I need to tell you something. He is going to come tonight.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, he is! He's going to make it to your house. You're in North Carolina, right?\nAUSTIN: Yep.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, yeah, he knows where you guys are. He's watching you. He's been watching you all year, and he knows you guys --\nAUSTIN: I'm going to move to another house.\nMRS. OBAMA: You're going to move? Well, he's going to be able to find you no matter where you go. That's the special thing about Santa. But you know, Santa only comes when you're fast asleep -- do you know that?\nAUSTIN: Yep. What are you eating for dinner?\nAUSTIN'S MOM: We've got to make sure that you're asleep for when Santa comes, right?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah!\nAUSTIN: Mm-hmm. I want to hear Santa talk.\nAUSTIN'S MOM: Well, hold on. This is one of Santa's helpers. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, yeah, Santa is very busy. He can't talk tonight because he's delivering all the gifts. Do you know how many gifts he's delivered already? He's delivered over 3 million gifts already! Isn't that exciting?\nAUSTIN'S MOM: That's a lot!\nMRS. OBAMA: That's a lot of gifts. Okay, you guys --\nAUSTIN: Are you up at the North Pole?\nMRS. OBAMA: I'm not at the North Pole right now. I'm in Hawaii, but I'm helping because I have access to the satellite information, because I live with the President and we have a lot of official equipment that travels with us. So I can see from the satellite where Santa is, because I'm helping him out tonight. I feel very honored to be helping Santa out tonight.\nAUSTIN'S MOM: Pretty neat, isn't it?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, it's a real honor. All right, you guys. You have to listen to your mom. And when she tells you it's bedtime, you've got to go to bed, okay?\nAUSTIN: Wah!\nMRS. OBAMA: You guys have a very merry Christmas. It sounds like it's going to be fun over there.\nAUSTIN: Merry Christmas!\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. You guys be good, okay?\nAUSTIN: Merry Christmas!\nMRS. OBAMA: Bye, sweeties!\nAUSTIN'S MOM: Bye!\nMRS. OBAMA: All right, thanks so much. You guys have a great day tomorrow.\nAUSTIN'S MOM: All right, you too. Merry Christmas.\n***\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi, is Jaden there? Hello, Jaden, can you hear me?\nJADEN: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Jaden, this is Michelle Obama. I'm the First Lady, and I'm here at NORAD, and I'm helping them track Santa. Is that why you called?\nJADEN: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: You'd like to find out where Santa is right now?\nJADEN: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, I'm looking at the satellite radar screen, and I can see that Santa right now is flying over a country called Croatia, which is all the way in Europe. It's all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. But he's flying really fast. He's got eight reindeer that are being led by Rudolph, because I can see -- because there's one in front with a shiny nose, and we know who that is, right?\nJADEN: Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer!\nMRS. OBAMA: That's the red-nosed reindeer, that's right. So he's going to be heading your way pretty fast, but he doesn't get to your house, Jayden, until you're fast asleep. That's one of the Santa rules. I know it's an exciting night tonight, but he's going to come as soon as you close your eyes and you're fast asleep. Are you ready for that?\nJADEN: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay. Are you going to have a good Christmas tomorrow?\nJADEN: Yes! Can't sleep!\nMRS. OBAMA: I know it's so exciting! Well, make sure you listen to your mom and dad tonight, okay? You listen to the grownups over there when they tell you to go to bed, okay?\nJADEN: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. And you be good, and have a wonderful day tomorrow, okay? It's going to be very special for you.\nJADEN: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. Merry Christmas, sweetie. Thank you for calling.\nJADEN: Merry Christmas!\n***\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi, is this Gage?\nGAGE: Yes, ma'am.\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi, Gage! This is Michelle Obama, the First Lady. I'm working at NORAD tonight, helping little boys and girls who want to track Santa. Is that why you called?\nGAGE: Yes, ma'am.\nMRS. OBAMA: You're looking for Santa? Okay, I'm going to look at the satellite radar screen right now. And oh my goodness, Gage, I can see Santa right now. He's flying -- at this point in time, he is flying over Albania. Can you believe that?\nGAGE: Nope.\nMRS. OBAMA: Albania is a country all the way on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean and near Europe. And he is flying with eight reindeer, but I see a lead -- I can see a lead reindeer with a shiny nose. Who do you think that is, Gage?\nGAGE: Rudolph.\nMRS. OBAMA: That is Rudolph. And I can see that Santa's sleigh is packed full of toys, probably for good little boys and girls like you. Have you been good this year, Gage?\nGAGE: Yes, ma'am.\nMRS. OBAMA: I bet you have. Well, you know how many gifts Santa has delivered already tonight? Over 3 million presents he's already delivered! He's been working so hard, Gage. But he's not going to stop until he gets to you, okay?\nGAGE: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: But he doesn't get to your house until you're fast asleep, sweetie, okay?\nGAGE: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: So when your folks tell you to go to bed, you've got to listen, okay?\nGAGE: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: I know it's an exciting night, but once you put your head on the pillow and you close your eyes and you have good dreams, when you wake up in the morning, Santa will have come, all right?\nGAGE: All right.\nMRS. OBAMA: You have a great day tomorrow, sweetie, okay?\nGAGE: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: And thank you for calling!\nGAGE: Merry Christmas!\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay, merry Christmas to your whole family, all right, sweetie?\nGAGE: Bye!\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay, bye-bye.\n***\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi! Who am I speaking with? This is Michelle Obama, the First Lady, and I'm helping NORAD track Santa for kids tonight. Who is calling?\nRYAN: Ryan.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's so good to hear from you! How old are you?\nRYAN: Ten.\nMRS. OBAMA: You are ten! Wow! This is an exciting night, isn't it?\nRYAN: Yup, it sure is.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's one of the most exciting nights of the year.\nRYAN: We're tracking Santa on the computer.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, I am watching Santa right now. I can see him pulling his reindeer, pulling them fast. They are moving so fast.\nRYAN: Yeah, they sure are.\nMRS. OBAMA: They are moving. And can you see that the sleigh is packed full of toys?\nRYAN: Yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: Pretty amazing! Right now, according to my records here, he's flying over Venice, Italy. But he's moving. He moves at the speed of light. So even as we speak, now he's somewhere else.\nRYAN: Yeah, on the computer, he's in Italy too.\nMRS. OBAMA: You see that? Well, we're looking at the same information.\nRYAN: Yep.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, yeah, so here's the thing, though -- Santa won't make it to your house until you're fast asleep. That's the deal. No matter where he is in the world.\nRYAN: Like, around midnight?\nMRS. OBAMA: What did you say, babe?\nRYAN: Like, around midnight.\nMRS. OBAMA: Is that when you're going to go to bed?\nRYAN: Uh, no. I'm going to be asleep at midnight!\nMRS. OBAMA: That is perfect.\nRYAN: I was asking if he was coming at midnight.\nMRS. OBAMA: He is going to come whenever you're fast asleep. So whenever that is, that's when he's going to come.\nRYAN: It depends on where he is.\nMRS. OBAMA: He's going to pop -- he can fly all over the world at the speed of light. So not every kid goes to bed at the same time, right?\nRYAN: Right.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, so he's got to -- he knows when you go to sleep, right?\nRYAN: Yes. I'm going to bed at eight.\nMRS. OBAMA: At eight? Okay, that sounds like a good plan. And he's going to know when you're fast asleep. Because you know how sometimes you say you're asleep and you're not really?\nRYAN: Yeah. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah -- he knows. So he's not going to come until he knows that you are fast asleep, okay?\nRYAN: Until he knows I'm dreaming and not noticing that he's even here.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's exactly right. You have to be fully dreaming. So here's what you have to do -- you have to get all the antsy nerves out that keep you awake. And you've got to just relax so that you drift off into a peaceful sleep, okay?\nRYAN: Yup.\nMRS. OBAMA: And when you wake up in the morning, what's going to happen?\nRYAN: I'm going to wake up, like, around seven, and then I'm going to go downstairs, and my dad is going to take pictures of me. And I'm going to look at my presents that Santa gave me overnight.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's going to be so good, isn't it?\nRYAN: Yep.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, it sounds like you are going to have a very merry Christmas tomorrow.\nRYAN: I sure am. I'm having a merry Christmas Eve.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, it's just been so good -- so exciting! Well, thank you for calling, sweetie. I hope I helped you out!\nRYAN: Thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay, well, tell your whole family merry Christmas for me, okay?\nRYAN: All right.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. Take care, sweetie. Have a good night.\nRYAN: You too.\nMRS. OBAMA: Bye-bye.\n***\nKIRSTEN: Hi, Mrs. Obama!\nMRS. OBAMA: Hey! How are you guys doing?\nKIRSTEN: We're doing good. How are you?\nMRS. OBAMA: I'm doing great. I'm excited, because it is Christmas Eve! How about you guys?\nKIRSTEN: We're really excited.\nMRS. OBAMA: This is the best night of the whole year. What do you guys want for Christmas?\nKIRSTEN: Well, I want a drone.\nJOSHUA: Hot Wheels garage!\nMRS. OBAMA: Ooh! My brother, when he was little, loved Hot Wheels. I'm glad to know that they're still around because those are pretty cool. Are you guys calling to find out where Santa is?\nKIRSTEN: Yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, that's my job tonight. I'm helping out Santa -- one of my favorite things to do. I'm looking at the satellite tracker at this moment, and it is showing -- oh my goodness! Kirsten, Joshua -- I am looking, and I can see Santa in his sleigh.\nKIRSTEN AND JOSHUA: (Gasps.)\nMRS. OBAMA: It is a big red sleigh and it is packed full of presents. And let me count -- I can see two, four, six, eight reindeer and one lead reindeer. Who do you think that lead reindeer is?\nKIRSTEN: Is it Rudolph?\nMRS. OBAMA: I see a shiny nose -- it's blinking! I see a little light blinking. That has got to be Rudolph, don't you think?\nKIRSTEN AND JOSHUA: (Gasps.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, and he is moving at the speed of light. Right now, he is flying over Hungary. Do you know where Hungary is?\nKIRSTEN: Mmm -- I don't think so.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's all the way on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\nKIRSTEN: Wow!\nMRS. OBAMA: And it's around where Europe is -- all those countries over there. But Santa can be anywhere at the speed of --\nJOSHUA AND KIRSTEN: Light!\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, he moves pretty fast. But he's not going to get to your house in Orlando, Florida until you guys are fast asleep -- did you know that?\nKIRSTEN: Yup.\nMRS. OBAMA: And that's a hard thing to do on Christmas Eve because everything is just so exciting, isn't it?\nKIRSTEN: Yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, but you've got to kind of calm your nerves. And when your parents tell you that it's time to go to bed, you've got to get in there, put your head on your pillow, and think good thoughts, and just try to go to sleep. And as soon as you both are fast asleep, he is going to come and deliver toys to you guys. And it's going to be good. It's going to be a great day tomorrow for you. I am very happy for you two. All right, you ready for that?\nKIRSTEN AND JOSHUA'S DAD: Thank you so much, Mrs. Obama!\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay, you guys have a great Christmas, okay?\nKIRSTEN AND JOSHUA'S DAD: You too -- merry Christmas!\nJOSHUA: Merry Christmas!\nMRS. OBAMA: All right, you guys, take care. Bye-bye.

Merry Christmas, everybody! One of the best parts of the holiday season is spending time with the special people in your life. And for me, that means getting some help from my best friend for our annual Christmas Weekly Address.\nThe First Lady. Now, given how our first Christmas Weekly Address went, I realize that Barack needed all the help he could get. [Laughter]\n[At this point, an outtake from the President's December 24, 2009, Weekly Address recording was shown, in which the First Lady spoke as follows.]\nThe First Lady. This is our first Christmas in the White House, and we——\n[In the outtake, the President began to laugh.]\nThe First Lady. What? Stop. What? You know—what? You've got to stop it. All right?\n[The President continued to laugh.]\nThe First Lady. You've got to get it together. You're going to have to pull it together, POTUS.\n[The outtake concluded, and the First Lady spoke as follows.]\nThe First Lady. [Laughter] Celebrating the holidays in the White House over these past 8 years has been a true privilege. We've been able to welcome over half a million guests. Our outstanding pastry chefs have baked 200,000 holiday cookies——\nThe President. That's a lot of cookies.\nThe First Lady. ——and Barack has treated the American people to countless dad jokes.\nThe President. They're great jokes.\nThe First Lady. Not so funny.\nThe President. Although a few got a \"Frosty\" reception.\nThe First Lady. The last one.\nThe President. Ha-ha-ha.\nThe First Lady. This year's White House holiday theme is \"The Gift of the Holidays,\" and our decorations reflect some of our greatest gifts as a nation: from our incredible military families to the life-changing impact of a great education.\nThe President. And the greatest gift that Michelle and I have received over the last 8 years has been the honor of serving as your President and First Lady. Together, we fought our way back from the worst recession in 80 years and got unemployment to a 9-year low. We secured health insurance for another twenty million Americans and new protections for folks who already had insurance. We made America more respected around the world, took on the mantle of leadership in the fight to protect this planet for our kids, and much, much more.\nBy so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we first got here. And I'm hopeful we'll build on the progress we've made together in the years to come. Tomorrow, for the final time as the First Family, we will join our fellow Christians around the world to rejoice in the birth of our Savior. And as we retell His story from that Holy Night, we'll also remember His eternal message, one of boundless love, compassion, and hope.\nThe First Lady. The idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper. That we should treat others as we would want to be treated. That we care for the sick, feed the hungry, welcome the stranger, no matter where they come from or how they practice their faith.\nThe President. Those are values that help guide not just my family's Christian faith, but that of Jewish Americans and Muslim Americans, nonbelievers and Americans of all backgrounds. And no one better embodies that spirit of service than the men and women who wear our country's uniform and their families.\nThe First Lady. As always, many of our troops are far from home this time of the year, and their families are serving and sacrificing right along with them. Their courage and dedication allow the rest of us to enjoy this season. That's why we've tried to serve them as well as they've served this country. Go to joiningforces.gov to see how you can honor and support the servicemembers, veterans, and military families in your community, not just during the holidays, but all year round.\nThe President. So as we look forward to the new year, let's resolve to recommit ourselves to the values we share. And on behalf of the all the Obamas—Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo, and that troublemaker Sunny—Merry Christmas, everybody.\nThe First Lady. And we wish you and your family a happy and healthy 2017.

This is one of our favorite things to do, because it's one of those circumstances where we get a chance to not just say thank you to our incredible men and women in uniform, but oftentimes, we also get a chance to see some families.\nAnd as Michelle and Jill Biden have worked so diligently to tell the rest of the country, not only do our troops serve, but their families serve alongside them.\n[At this point, the First Lady applauded and cheered.]\nSee—[applause]—that's what she just said.\nAnd yesterday, during Christmas, something that I've been doing during Christmas in——\nThe First Lady. Today is Christmas.\nThe President. Or yesterday, during Christmas Eve, thank you, but it was Christmas——\nThe First Lady. He's on vacation. [Laughter]\nThe President. No, no, no, hold on. There's a reason for that slight error, because my time was off. Yesterday I called—as I do every Christmas—some of our folks that are stationed overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and some in some very remote spots; some of them who, as we speak, are carrying out missions to defeat ISIL, carrying out missions to protect us from all manner of threat.\nAnd just to remind them that, as tough as it is to be deployed, the people here in America, back home, understand that every single day that you're serving, you're fighting for our freedom and fighting to keep us safe and fighting to maintain our way of life. It's impossible for us to fully repay what you've done and the sacrifices you make. But at least, it's important to hear from us that what you do matters and that we know about it and that we're grateful and that we'll stay grateful even when many of you end up being out of uniform and are veterans and that we make sure that we're serving you as well you served us.\nSo I just want all of you to know that it has been the privilege of my life to serve as your Commander in Chief. I know Michelle feels the same way when it comes to being able to stand alongside our military families and our veterans. And although this will be my last time addressing you as President, I want you to know that, as a citizen, my gratitude will remain and our commitment to standing by you every step of the way, that won't stop.\nSo thank you so much for everything that you've done. I hope you guys have had a wonderful Christmas. Young people, I hope Santa was okay. [Laughter] And we look forward to seeing you for many years to come, because I understand that I still have a little bit of rank as ex-President. [Laughter] So I still get to use the gym on base—[laughter]—and, of course, the golf course. [Laughter]\nSo thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. We'll see you taking pictures.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119923", "text": "(Palm Beach, FL) - President-elect Donald J. Trump today announced his selection of Thomas P. Bossert to serve as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. In this position, Mr. Bossert will advise the President on issues related to homeland security, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity, and coordinate the Cabinet's process for formulating and executing policy in these matters.\nThe role, performed by a deputy national security advisor in the previous Administration, is being elevated and restored to its independent status alongside the National Security Advisor, a decision that reflects the unwavering commitment President-elect Trump has to the safety and security of the Nation, its people and territory. Mr. Bossert will focus on domestic and transnational security priorities as General Michael Flynn remains steadfastly focused on international security challenges.\n\"Tom brings enormous depth and breadth of knowledge and experience to protecting the homeland to our senior White House team,\" said President-elect Trump. \"He has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity challenges. He will be an invaluable asset to our Administration.\"\n\"I am grateful for this opportunity, for the faith President-elect Trump has placed in me, and for the chance to serve again in a position of such extraordinary public trust,\" Mr. Bossert said. \"I am looking forward to working closely with Gen. Flynn as we together help the President-elect advance the interests of the United States and its allies. Further, I also look forward to maintaining a strong, deeply respectful relationship with the governors, mayors, police and fire fighters, emergency managers, EMS professionals, and public health officials that constitute the backbone of our homeland security and our National preparedness.\"\nWith regard to cybersecurity, Mr. Bossert additionally noted, \"We must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law, honoring the rights of personal property, the benefits of free and fair trade, and the fundamental principles of liberty. The internet is a U.S. invention, it should reflect these U.S. values as it continues to transform the future for all nations and all generations.\"\nMr. Bossert served in the White House previously as the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. In that capacity, he supported and advised the President on matters of homeland and national security, counterterrorism, cybersecurity and continuity of operations. Mr. Bossert spearheaded efforts to improve civil government operations, co-authored and edited the National Strategy for Homeland Security of 2007, was a principle author of the lessons learned report on the Hurricane Katrina response and was deeply involved in the effort to develop the U.S. cybersecurity strategy, among others. He also served as Special Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Senior Director for Preparedness Policy. He was Director of Infrastructure Protection Policy prior to that.\nSince 2009, Mr. Bossert has run his own independent homeland and national security consulting business and served as a Senior Cybersecurity Fellow at the U.S. Atlantic Council. Mr. Bossert held other positions in federal government, including positions with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration, the Office of the Independent Counsel and the U.S. House of Representatives.\nFrances F. Townsend, former Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor to President George W. Bush, applauded the selection, saying \"I have every confidence that Tom will continue to demonstrate the capacity and insight needed to take on the tough challenges facing the country.\"\nKenneth L. Wainstein, former FBI General Counsel, Assistant Attorney General, and Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor also praised the selection. \"Tom Bossert is a dedicated public servant and proven national security professional with significant hands-on experience navigating through security crises and challenges. With his background, Tom is uniquely suited to coordinate the government's homeland security apparatus, and I applaud the President-elect for selecting Tom for this critical White House position,\" said Wainstein.\nMr. Bossert received a J.D. from the George Washington University Law School and a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh.", "timestamp": "2016-12-27", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

Prime Minister Abe spoke in Japanese, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119934", "text": "Prime Minister Abe. President Obama, Commander Harris, ladies and gentlemen, and all American citizens: I stand here at Pearl Harbor as the Prime Minister of Japan.\nIf we listen closely, we can make out the sound of restless waves breaking and then retreating again. The calm inlet of brilliant blue is radiant with the gentle sparkle of the warm sun. Behind me, a striking white form atop the azure is the USS Arizona Memorial.\nTogether with President Obama, I paid a visit to that memorial, the resting place for many souls. It was a place which brought utter silence to me. Inscribed there are the names of the servicemen who lost their lives. Sailors and marines hailing from California and New York, Michigan and Texas, and various other places, serving to uphold their noble duty of protecting the homeland they loved, lost their lives amidst searing flames that day when aerial bombing tore the USS Arizona in two.\nEven 75 years later, the USS Arizona, now at rest atop the seabed, is the final resting place for a tremendous number of sailors and Marines. Listening again, as I focus my senses, alongside the song of the breeze and the rumble of the rolling waves, I can almost discern the voices of those crewmen: voices of lively conversations, upbeat and at ease on that day, on a Sunday morning; voices of young servicemen talking to each other about their futures and dreams; voices calling out the names of loved ones in their very final moments; voices praying for the happiness of children still unborn. Each and every one of those servicemen had a mother and a father anxious about his safety. Many had wives and girlfriends they loved, and many must have had children they would have loved watch grow up. All of that was brought to an end. When I contemplate that solemn reality, I am rendered entirely speechless.\n\"Rest in peace, precious souls of the fallen.\" With that overwhelming sentiment, I cast flowers, on behalf of Japanese people, upon the waters where those sailors and marines sleep.\nPresident Obama, the people of the United States of America, and the people around the world: As the Prime Minister of Japan, I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place and also to the souls of the countless innocent people who became the victims of the war.\nWe must never repeat the horrors of war again. This is the solemn vow we, the people of Japan, have taken. And since the war, we have created a free and democratic country that values the rule of law and has resolutely upheld our vow never again to wage war. We, the people of Japan, will continue to uphold this unwavering principle while harboring quiet pride in the path we have walked as a peace-loving nation over these 70 years since the war ended.\nTo the souls of the servicemen who lie in eternal rest aboard the USS Arizona, to the American people, and to all peoples around the world, I pledge that unwavering vow here as the Prime Minister of Japan.\nYesterday, at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay, I visited the memorial marker for an Imperial Japanese Navy officer. He was a fighter pilot by the name of Commander Fusata Iida, who was hit during the attack on Pearl Harbor and gave up on returning to his aircraft carrier. He went back instead and died. It was not Japanese who erected a marker at the site that Iida's fighter plane crashed; it was U.S. servicemen who had been on the receiving end of his attack. Applauding the bravery of the dead pilot, they erected this stone marker.\nOn the marker, his rank at that time is inscribed—lieutenant, Imperial Japanese Navy—showing the respect to a serviceman who gave his life for his country. \"The brave respect the brave.\" So wrote Ambrose Bierce in a famous poem. Showing respect even to an enemy they fought against, trying to understand even an enemy that they hated, therein lies the spirit of tolerance embraced by the American people.\nWhen the war ended and Japan was a nation in burnt-out ruins as far as the eye could see, suffering under abject poverty, it was the United States and its good people that unstintingly sent us food to eat and clothes to wear. The Japanese people managed to survive and make their way toward the future, thanks to the sweaters and milk sent by the American people. And it was the United States that opened up the path for Japan to return to the international community once more after the war.\nUnder the leadership of the United States, Japan, as a member of the free world, was able to enjoy peace and prosperity. The good will and assistance you extended to us Japanese—the enemy you had fought so fiercely—together with the tremendous spirit of tolerance, were etched deeply into the hearts and minds of our grandfathers and mothers. We also remember them. Our children and grandchildren will also continue to pass these memories down and never forget what you did for us.\nThe words pass through my mind, those words inscribed on the wall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, where I visited with President Obama: \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, let us strive on to do all which may achieve and cherish a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" These are the words of President Abraham Lincoln.\nOn behalf of the Japanese people, I hereby wish to express once again my heartfelt gratitude to the United States and to the world for the tolerance extended to Japan.\nIt has now been 75 years since that Pearl Harbor. Japan and the United States, which fought a fierce war that will go down in the annals of human history, have become allies, with deep and strong ties rarely found anywhere in history. We are allies that will tackle together, to an even greater degree than ever before, the many challenges covering the globe. Ours is an alliance of hope that will lead us to the future.\nWhat has bonded us together is the power of reconciliation made possible through the spirit of tolerance. What I want to appeal to the people of the world here at Pearl Harbor, together with President Obama, is this power of reconciliation. Even today, the horrors of war have not been eradicated from the surface of the world. There is no end to the spiral where hatred creates hatred. The world needs the spirit of tolerance and the power of reconciliation now and especially now.\nJapan and the United States, which have eradicated hatred and cultivated friendship and trust on the basis of common values, are now—and especially now—taking responsibility for appealing to the world about the importance of tolerance and the power of reconciliation. That is precisely why the Japan-U.S. alliance is an alliance of hope. The inlet gazing at us is tranquil as far as the eye can see: Pearl Harbor. It is precisely this beautiful inlet shimmering like pearls that is a symbol of tolerance and reconciliation. It is my wish that our Japanese children and, President Obama, your American children, and indeed, their children and grandchildren and people all around the world will continue to remember Pearl Harbor as a symbol of reconciliation.\nWe will spare no efforts to continue our endeavors to make that wish a reality. Together with President Obama, I hereby make my steadfast pledge. Thank you very much.\nPresident Obama. Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the American people, thank you for your gracious words. Thank you for your presence here today, an historic gesture that speaks to the power of reconciliation and the alliance between the American and Japanese peoples; a reminder that even the deepest wounds of war can give way to friendship and lasting peace.\nDistinguished guests, members of our Armed Forces, and most of all, survivors of Pearl Harbor and their loved ones: Aloha.\nAudience members. Aloha.\nPresident Obama. To Americans, especially to those of us who call Hawaii home, this harbor is a sacred place. As we lay a wreath or toss flowers into waters that still weep, we think of the more than 2,400 American patriots—fathers and husbands, wives and daughters—manning Heaven's rails for all eternity. We salute the defenders of Oahu who pull themselves a little straighter every December 7, and we reflect on the heroism that shone here 75 years ago.\nAs dawn broke that December day, paradise never seemed so sweet. The water was warm and impossibly blue. Sailors ate in the mess hall or readied themselves for church, dressed in crisp white shorts and T-shirts. In the harbor, ships at anchor floated in neat rows: the California, the Maryland and the Oklahoma, the Tennessee, the West Virginia, and the Nevada. On the deck of the Arizona, the Navy band was tuning up.\nThat morning, the ranks on men's shoulders defined them less than the courage in their hearts. Across the island, Americans defended themselves however they could: firing training shells, working old bolt-action rifles. An African American mess steward, who would typically be confined to cleaning duties, carried his commander to safety and then fired an antiaircraft gun until he ran out of ammo.\nWe honor Americans like Jim Downing, a gunner's mate first class on the West Virginia. Before he raced to the harbor, his new bride pressed into his hand a verse of Scripture: \"The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.\" As Jim fought to save his ship, he simultaneously gathered the names of the fallen so that he could give closure to their families. He said, \"It was just something you do.\"\nWe remember Americans like Harry Pang, a fireman from Honolulu, who, in the face of withering fire, worked to douse burning planes until he gave his last full measure of devotion—one of the only civilian firefighters ever to receive the Purple Heart.\nWe salute Americans like Chief Petty Officer John Finn, who manned a .50-caliber machine gun for more than 2 hours and was wounded more than 20 times, earning him our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.\nAnd it is here that we reflect on how war tests our most enduring values. How, even as Japanese Americans were deprived of their own liberty during the war, one of the most decorated military units in the history of the United States was the 442d Infantry Regiment and its 100th Infantry Battalion: the Japanese American Nisei. In that 442d served my friend and proud Hawaiian, Daniel Inouye, a man who was a Senator from Hawaii for most of my life and with whom I would find myself proud to serve in the Senate Chamber; a man who was not only a recipient of the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but was one of the most distinguished statesmen of his generation as well.\nHere at Pearl Harbor, America's first battle of the Second World War roused a nation. Here, in so many ways, America came of age. A generation of Americans, including my grandparents, that Greatest Generation, they did not seek war, but they refused to shrink from it. And they all did their part on fronts and in factories. And while, 75 years later, the proud ranks of Pearl Harbor survivors have thinned with time, the bravery we recall here is forever etched in our national heart. I would ask all our Pearl Harbor and World War II veterans who are able to, to please stand or raise your hands, because a grateful nation thanks you.\nThe character of nations is tested in war, but it is defined in peace. After one of the most horrific chapters in human history, one that took not tens of thousands, but tens of millions of lives with ferocious fighting across this ocean, the United States and Japan chose friendship, and they chose peace. Over the decades, our alliance has made both of our nations more successful. It has helped underwrite an international order that has prevented another World War and that has lifted more than a billion people out of extreme poverty. Today, the alliance between the United States and Japan—bound not only by shared interests, but also rooted in common values—stands as the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and a force for progress around the globe. Our alliance has never been stronger.\nIn good times and in bad, we are there for each other. Recall 5 years ago, when a wall of water bore down on Japan and reactors in Fukushima melted, America's men and women in uniform were there to help our Japanese friends. Across the globe, the United States and Japan work shoulder-to-shoulder to strengthen the security of the Asia-Pacific and the world: turning back piracy, combating disease, slowing the spread of nuclear weapons, keeping the peace in war-torn lands.\nEarlier this year, near Pearl Harbor, Japan joined with two dozen nations in the world's largest maritime military exercise. And that included our Forces from U.S. Pacific Command led by Admiral Harry Harris, the son of an American naval officer and a Japanese mother. Harry was born in Yokosuka, but you wouldn't know it from his Tennessee twang. [Laughter] Thank you, Harry, for your outstanding leadership.\nIn this sense, our presence here today—the connections not just between our governments, but between our people, the presence of Prime Minister Abe here today—remind us of what is possible between nations and between peoples. Wars can end. The most bitter of adversaries can become the strongest of allies. The fruits of peace always outweigh the plunder of war. This is the enduring truth of this hallowed harbor.\nIt is here that we remember that even when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different. The sacrifice made here, the anguish of war, reminds us to seek the divine spark that is common to all humanity. It insists that we strive to be what our Japanese friends call otagai no tame ni—\"with and for each other.\"\nThat's the lesson of Captain William Callaghan of the Missouri. Even after an attack on his ship, he ordered that the Japanese pilot be laid to rest with military honors, wrapped in a Japanese flag sewn by American sailors. It's the lesson, in turn, of the Japanese pilot who, years later, returned to this harbor, befriended an old marine bugler and asked him to play taps and lay two roses at this memorial every month, one for America's fallen and one for Japan's.\nIt's a lesson our two peoples learn every day, in the most ordinary of ways, whether it's Americans studying in Tokyo, young Japanese studying across America; scientists from our two nations together unraveling the mysteries of cancer or combating climate change, exploring the stars. It's a baseball player like Ichiro lighting up a stadium in Miami, buoyed by the shared pride of two peoples, both American and Japanese, united in peace and friendship.\nAs nations and as people, we cannot choose the history that we inherit. But we can choose what lessons to draw from it and use those lessons to chart our own futures.\nPrime Minister Abe, I welcome you here in the spirit of friendship, as the people of Japan have always welcomed me. I hope that together, we send a message to the world that there is more to be won in peace than in war; that reconciliation carries more rewards than retribution.\nHere in this quiet harbor, we honor those we lost, and we give thanks for all that our two nations have won together as friends.\nMay God hold the fallen in His everlasting arms. May He watch over our veterans and all who stand guard on our behalf. May God bless us all.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-12-27", "title": "Remarks With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Joint Base Pearl Harbor—Hickam, Hawaii"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on January 5.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119941", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nRising from the center of the southeastern Utah landscape and visible from every direction are twin buttes so distinctive that in each of the native languages of the region their name is the same: Hoon'Naqvut, Shash Jáa, Kwiyagatu Nukavachi, Ansh An Lashokdiwe, or \"Bears Ears.\" For hundreds of generations, native peoples lived in the surrounding deep sandstone canyons, desert mesas, and meadow mountaintops, which constitute one of the densest and most significant cultural landscapes in the United States. Abundant rock art, ancient cliff dwellings, ceremonial sites, and countless other artifacts provide an extraordinary archaeological and cultural record that is important to us all, but most notably the land is profoundly sacred to many Native American tribes, including the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah Ouray, Hopi Nation, and Zuni Tribe.\nThe area's human history is as vibrant and diverse as the ruggedly beautiful landscape. From the earliest occupation, native peoples left traces of their presence. Clovis people hunted among the cliffs and canyons of Cedar Mesa as early as 13,000 years ago, leaving behind tools and projectile points in places like the Lime Ridge Clovis Site, one of the oldest known archaeological sites in Utah. Archaeologists believe that these early people hunted mammoths, ground sloths, and other now-extinct megafauna, a narrative echoed by native creation stories. Hunters and gatherers continued to live in this region in the Archaic Period, with sites dating as far back as 8,500 years ago.\nAncestral Puebloans followed, beginning to occupy the area at least 2,500 years ago, leaving behind items from their daily life such as baskets, pottery, and weapons. These early farmers of Basketmaker II, and III and builders of Pueblo I, II and III left their marks on the land. The remains of single family dwellings, granaries, kivas, towers, and large villages and roads linking them together reveal a complex cultural history. \"Moki steps,\" hand and toe holds carved into steep canyon walls by the Ancestral Puebloans, illustrate the early people's ingenuity and perseverance and are still used today to access dwellings along cliff walls. Other, distinct cultures have thrived here as well—the Fremont People, Numic- and Athabaskan-speaking hunter-gatherers, and Utes and Navajos. Resources such as the Doll House Ruin in Dark Canyon Wilderness Area and the Moon House Ruin on Cedar Mesa allow visitors to marvel at artistry and architecture that have withstood thousands of seasons in this harsh climate.\nThe landscape is a milieu of the accessible and observable together with the inaccessible and hidden. The area's petroglyphs and pictographs capture the imagination with images dating back at least 5,000 years and spanning a range of styles and traditions. From life-size ghostlike figures that defy categorization, to the more literal depictions of bighorn sheep, birds, and lizards, these drawings enable us to feel the humanity of these ancient artists. The Indian Creek area contains spectacular rock art, including hundreds of petroglyphs at Newspaper Rock. Visitors to Bears Ears can also discover more recent rock art left by the Ute, Navajo, and Paiute peoples. It is also the less visible sites, however—those that supported the food gathering, subsistence and ceremony of daily life—that tell the story of the people who lived here. Historic remnants of Native American sheep-herding and farming are scattered throughout the area, and pottery and Navajo hogans record the lifeways of native peoples in the 19th and 20th centuries. For thousands of years, humans have occupied and stewarded this land. With respect to most of these people, their contribution to the historical record is unknown, but some have played a more public role. Famed Navajo headman K'aayélii was born around 1800 near the twin Bears Ears buttes. His band used the area's remote canyons to elude capture by the U.S. Army and avoid the fate that befell many other Navajo bands: surrender, the Long Walk, and forced relocation to Bosque Redondo. Another renowned 19th century Navajo leader, \"Hastiin Ch'ihaajin\" Manuelito, was also born near the Bears Ears.\nThe area's cultural importance to Native American tribes continues to this day. As they have for generations, these tribes and their members come here for ceremonies and to visit sacred sites. Throughout the region, many landscape features, such as Comb Ridge, the San Juan River, and Cedar Mesa, are closely tied to native stories of creation, danger, protection, and healing. The towering spires in the Valley of the Gods are sacred to the Navajo, representing ancient Navajo warriors frozen in stone. Traditions of hunting, fishing, gathering, and wood cutting are still practiced by tribal members, as is collection of medicinal and ceremonial plants, edible herbs, and materials for crafting items like baskets and footwear. The traditional ecological knowledge amassed by the Native Americans whose ancestors inhabited this region, passed down from generation to generation, offers critical insight into the historic and scientific significance of the area. Such knowledge is, itself, a resource to be protected and used in understanding and managing this landscape sustainably for generations to come.\nEuro-Americans first explored the Bears Ears area during the 18th century, and Mormon settlers followed in the late 19th century. The San Juan Mission expedition traversed this rugged country in 1880 on their journey to establish a new settlement in what is now Bluff, Utah. To ease the passage of wagons over the slick rock slopes and through the canyonlands, the settlers smoothed sections of the rock surface and constructed dugways and other features still visible along their route, known as the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail. Cabins, corrals, trails, and carved inscriptions in the rock reveal the lives of ranchers, prospectors, and early archaeologists. Cattle rustlers and other outlaws created a convoluted trail network known as the Outlaw Trail, said to be used by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. These outlaws took advantage of the area's network of canyons, including the aptly-named Hideout Canyon, to avoid detection.\nThe area's stunning geology, from sharp pinnacles to broad mesas, labyrinthine canyons to solitary hoodoos, and verdant hanging gardens to bare stone arches and natural bridges, provides vital insights to geologists. In the east, the Abajo Mountains tower, reaching elevations of more than 11,000 feet. A long geologic history is documented in the colorful rock layers visible in the area's canyons.\nFor long periods over 300 million years ago, these lands were inundated by tropical seas and hosted thriving coral reefs. These seas infused the area's black rock shale with salts as they receded. Later, the lands were bucked upwards multiple times by the Monument Upwarp, and near-volcanoes punched up through the rock, leaving their marks on the landscape without reaching the surface. In the sandstone of Cedar Mesa, fossil evidence has revealed large, mammal-like reptiles that burrowed into the sand to survive the blistering heat of the end of the Permian Period, when the region was dominated by a seaside desert. Later, in the Late Triassic Period more than 200 million years ago, seasonal monsoons flooded an ancient river system that fed a vast desert here.\nThe paleontological resources in the Bears Ears area are among the richest and most significant in the United States, and protection of this area will provide important opportunities for further archaeological and paleontological study. Many sites, such as Arch Canyon, are teeming with fossils, and research conducted in the Bears Ears area is revealing new insights into the transition of vertebrate life from reptiles to mammals and from sea to land. Numerous ray-\nfinned fish fossils from the Permian Period have been discovered, along with other late Paleozoic Era fossils, including giant amphibians, synapsid reptiles, and important plant fossils. Fossilized traces of marine and aquatic creatures such as clams, crayfish, fish, and aquatic reptiles have been found in Indian Creek's Chinle Formation, dating to the Triassic Period, and phytosaur and dinosaur fossils from the same period have been found along Comb Ridge. Paleontologists have identified new species of plant-eating crocodile-like reptiles and mass graves of lumbering sauropods, along with metoposaurus, crocodiles, and other dinosaur fossils. Fossilized trackways of early tetrapods can be seen in the Valley of the Gods and in Indian Creek, where paleontologists have also discovered exceptional examples of fossilized ferns, horsetails, and cycads. The Chinle Formation and the Wingate, Kayenta, and Navajo Formations above it provide one of the best continuous rock records of the Triassic-Jurassic transition in the world, crucial to understanding how dinosaurs dominated terrestrial ecosystems and how our mammalian ancestors evolved. In Pleistocene Epoch sediments, scientists have found traces of mammoths, short-faced bears, ground sloths, primates, and camels.\nFrom earth to sky, the region is unsurpassed in wonders. The star-filled nights and natural quiet of the Bears Ears area transport visitors to an earlier eon. Against an absolutely black night sky, our galaxy and others more distant leap into view. As one of the most intact and least roaded areas in the contiguous United States, Bears Ears has that rare and arresting quality of deafening silence.\nCommunities have depended on the resources of the region for hundreds of generations. Understanding the important role of the green highlands in providing habitat for subsistence plants and animals, as well as capturing and filtering water from passing storms, the Navajo refer to such places as \"Nahodishgish,\" or places to be left alone. Local communities seeking to protect the mountains for their watershed values have long recognized the importance of the Bears Ears' headwaters. Wildfires, both natural and human-set, have shaped and maintained forests and grasslands of this area for millennia. Ranchers have relied on the forests and grasslands of the region for ages, and hunters come from across the globe for a chance at a bull elk or other big game. Today, ecological restoration through the careful use of wildfire and management of grazing and timber is working to restore and maintain the health of these vital watersheds and grasslands.\nThe diversity of the soils and microenvironments in the Bears Ears area provide habitat for a wide variety of vegetation. The highest elevations, in the Elk Ridge area of the Manti-La Sal National Forest, contain pockets of ancient Engelmann spruce, ponderosa pine, aspen, and subalpine fir. Mesa tops include pinyon-juniper woodlands along with big sagebrush, low sage, blackbrush, rabbitbrush, bitterbrush, four-wing saltbush, shadscale, winterfat, Utah serviceberry, western chokecherry, hackberry, barberry, cliff rose, and greasewood. Canyons contain diverse vegetation ranging from yucca and cacti such as prickly pear, claret cup, and Whipple's fishhook to mountain mahogany, ponderosa pine, alder, sagebrush, birch, dogwood, and Gambel's oak, along with occasional stands of aspen. Grasses and herbaceous species such as bluegrass, bluestem, giant ryegrass, ricegrass, needle and thread, yarrow, common mallow, balsamroot, low larkspur, horsetail, and peppergrass also grow here, as well as pinnate spring parsley, Navajo penstemon, Canyonlands lomatium, and the Abajo daisy.\nTucked into winding canyons are vibrant riparian communities characterized by Fremont cottonwood, western sandbar willow, yellow willow, and box elder. Numerous seeps provide year-round water and support delicate hanging gardens, moisture-loving plants, and relict species such as Douglas fir. A few populations of the rare Kachina daisy, endemic to the Colorado Plateau, hide in shaded seeps and alcoves of the area's canyons. A genetically distinct population of Kachina daisy was also found on Elk Ridge. The alcove columbine and cave primrose, also regionally endemic, grow in seeps and hanging gardens in the Bears Ears landscape. Wildflowers such as beardtongue, evening primrose, aster, Indian paintbrush, yellow and purple beeflower, straight bladderpod, Durango tumble mustard, scarlet gilia, globe mallow, sand verbena, sego lily, cliffrose, sacred datura, monkey flower, sunflower, prince's plume, hedgehog cactus, and columbine, bring bursts of color to the landscape.\nThe diverse vegetation and topography of the Bears Ears area, in turn, support a variety of wildlife species. Mule deer and elk range on the mesas and near canyon heads, which provide crucial habitat for both species. The Cedar Mesa landscape is home to bighorn sheep which were once abundant but still live in Indian Creek, and in the canyons north of the San Juan River. Small mammals such as desert cottontail, black-tailed jackrabbit, prairie dog, Botta's pocket gopher, white-tailed antelope squirrel, Colorado chipmunk, canyon mouse, deer mouse, pinyon mouse, and desert woodrat, as well as Utah's only population of Abert's tassel-eared squirrels, find shelter and sustenance in the landscape's canyons and uplands. Rare shrews, including a variant of Merriam's shrew and the dwarf shrew can be found in this area.\nCarnivores, including badger, coyote, striped skunk, ringtail, gray fox, bobcat, and the occasional mountain lion, all hunt here, while porcupines use their sharp quills and climbing abilities to escape these predators. Oral histories from the Ute describe the historic presence of bison, antelope, and abundant bighorn sheep, which are also depicted in ancient rock art. Black bear pass through the area but are rarely seen, though they are common in the oral histories and legends of this region, including those of the Navajo.\nConsistent sources of water in a dry landscape draw diverse wildlife species to the area's riparian habitats, including an array of amphibian species such as tiger salamander, red-spotted toad, Woodhouse's toad, canyon tree frog, Great Basin spadefoot, and northern leopard frog. Even the most sharp-eyed visitors probably will not catch a glimpse of the secretive Utah night lizard. Other reptiles in the area include the sagebrush lizard, eastern fence lizard, tree lizard, side-blotched lizard, plateau striped whiptail, western rattlesnake, night snake, striped whipsnake, and gopher snake.\nRaptors such as the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, northern harrier, northern goshawk, red-tailed hawk, ferruginous hawk, American kestrel, flammulated owl, and great horned owl hunt their prey on the mesa tops with deadly speed and accuracy. The largest contiguous critical habitat for the threatened Mexican spotted owl is on the Manti-La Sal National Forest. Other bird species found in the area include Merriam's turkey, Williamson's sapsucker, common nighthawk, white-throated swift, ash-throated flycatcher, violet-green swallow, cliff swallow, mourning dove, pinyon jay, sagebrush sparrow, canyon towhee, rock wren, sage thrasher, and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher.\nAs the skies darken in the evenings, visitors may catch a glimpse of some the area's at least 15 species of bats, including the big free-tailed bat, pallid bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, spotted bat, and silver-haired bat. Tinajas, rock depressions filled with rainwater, provide habitat for many specialized aquatic species, including pothole beetles and freshwater shrimp. Eucosma navajoensis, an endemic moth that has only been described near Valley of the Gods, is unique to this area.\nProtection of the Bears Ears area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. The Bears Ears area has been proposed for protection by members of Congress, Secretaries of the Interior, State and tribal leaders, and local conservationists for at least 80 years. The area contains numerous objects of historic and of scientific interest, and it provides world class outdoor recreation opportunities, including rock climbing, hunting, hiking, backpacking, canyoneering, whitewater rafting, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Because visitors travel from near and far, these lands support a growing travel and tourism sector that is a source of economic opportunity for the region.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve the objects of scientific and historic interest on the Bears Ears lands;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Bears Ears National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation.

This remote and rugged desert landscape is known as Gold Butte.\nThe Gold Butte area contains an extraordinary variety of diverse and irreplaceable scientific, historic, and prehistoric resources, including vital plant and wildlife habitat, significant geological formations, rare fossils, important sites from the history of Native Americans, and remnants of our Western mining and ranching heritage. The landscape reveals a story of thousands of years of human interaction with this harsh environment and provides a rare glimpse into the lives of Nevada's first inhabitants, the rich and varied indigenous cultures that followed, and the eventual arrival of Euro-American settlers. Canyons and intricate rock formations are a stunning backdrop to the area's famously beautiful rock art, and the desert provides critical habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise.\nGold Butte's dynamic environment has provided food and shelter to humans for at least 12,000 years. Remnants of massive agave roasting pits, charred remains of goosefoot and pinyon pine nuts, bone fragments, and projectile points used to hunt big horn sheep and smaller game serve as evidence of the remarkable abilities of indigenous communities to eke out sustenance from this unforgiving landscape. Visitors to Gold Butte can still see ancient rock shelters and hearth remnants concealed in the area's dramatic Aztec Sandstone formations. This brightly hued sandstone is the canvas for the area's spectacular array of rock art, depicting human figures, animals, and swirling abstract designs at locations like the famed Falling Man petroglyph site and Kohta Circus. Pottery sherds and other archaeological artifacts scattered throughout the landscape reveal the area's role as a corridor for the interregional trade of pottery, salt, and rare minerals. These world-renowned archaeological sites and objects are helping scientists to better understand interactions between ancient cultural groups.\nBy the time Spanish explorers arrived in the region in the late eighteenth century, the Gold Butte area was home to the Southern Paiute people, who to this day, retain a spiritual and cultural connection with the land and use it for traditional purposes such as ceremonies and plant harvesting. Hunters and settlers of European descent followed the explorers, and, by 1865, Mormon pioneers had built settlements in the region.\nThese newcomers grazed livestock and explored Gold Butte's unique geology in pursuit of mining riches. Their activities left behind historic sites and objects that tell the story of the American West, including the Gold Butte townsite, a mining boomtown established in the early 1900s, but mostly abandoned by 1910. Several building foundations and arrastas—large flat rocks used for crushing ore—remain at the townsite today. Settlers built corrals out of wood or stone, some of which are still standing in the Gold Butte area, including one near the Gold Butte townsite and one at Horse Springs, along the Gold Butte Scenic Byway. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was put to work in the area, leaving behind a variety of historic features including a dam and remnants of a camp in the Whitney Pockets area, in the northeastern region of Gold Butte.\nThe Gold Butte landscape that visitors experience today is the product of millions of years of heat and pressure as well as the eroding forces of water and wind that molded this vast and surreal desert terrain. Rising up from the Virgin River to an elevation of almost 8,000 feet, the Virgin Mountains delineate the area's northeast corner and provide a stunning backdrop for the rugged gray and red desert of the lower elevations. Faulted carbonate and silicate rock form the ridges and peaks of this range, which are regularly snow-covered in winter and spring, while the southern region of Gold Butte is laced with a series of wide granitic ridges and narrow canyons. These broad landscape features are dotted with fantastical geologic formations, including vividly hued Aztec Sandstone twisted into otherworldly shapes by wind and water, as well as pale, desolate granitic domes. An actively-expanding 1,200 square-meter sinkhole known as the Devil's Throat has been the subject of multiple scientific studies that have enhanced our understanding of sinkhole formation.\nThe Gold Butte landscape is a mosaic of braided and shallow washes that flow into the Virgin River to the north and directly into Lake Mead on the south and west. Several natural springs provide important water sources for the plants and animals living here. The arid eastern Mojave Desert landscape that dominates the area is characterized by the creosote bush and white bursage vegetative community that covers large, open expanses scattered with low shrubs. Blackbrush scrub, a slow-growing species that can live up to 400 years, is abundant in middle elevations. Both creosote-bursage and blackbrush scrub vegetation communities can take decades or even centuries to recover from disturbances due to the long-lived nature of the plant species in these vegetative communities and the area's low rainfall. These vegetation communities are impacted by human uses, invasive species, wildfires, and changing climates. Gypsum deposits are a distinctive aspect of the Mojave Desert ecosystem and result in soil that contains physical and chemical properties that stress many plants, but also support endemic and rare species. For example, the sticky ringstem, Las Vegas buckwheat, and Las Vegas bearpoppy are unique plants that rely on gypsum soil; the populations in Gold Butte are some of only a handful of isolated populations of these species left in the world. Other rare plants in Gold Butte include the threecorner milkvetch and sticky wild buckwheat, which are sand-dependent species, as well as the Rosy two-tone beardtongue and the Mokiak milkvetch. Scattered stands of Joshua trees, an emblem of the Mojave Desert, dot the landscape along with Mojave yucca, cacti species, and chaparral species, among others.\nThe often snowcapped peaks of the Virgin Mountains in the northeastern corner of Gold Butte stand in stark contrast to the desolate desert landscapes found elsewhere in the area. Due to their elevation of almost 8,000 feet, these mountains exhibit a transition between ecosystems in the southwest. At the highest points of the Virgin Mountains, visitors can hike through Ponderosa pine and white fir forests, and visit the southernmost stand of Douglas fir in Nevada. In this area, visitors are also treated to a rare sight: the Silver State's only stand of the Arizona cypress. The lower to middle elevations of the area are home to stands of pinyon pine, Utah juniper, sagebrush, and acacia woodlands, along with occasional mesquite stands. By adding structural complexity to a shrub-dominated landscape, these woodlands provide important breeding, foraging, and resting places for a variety of creatures, including birds and insects, and support a number of plant species.\nGold Butte also provides habitat for a number of wildlife species. It has been designated as critical habitat for the Mojave desert tortoise, which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. These slow-footed symbols of the American Southwest rely on the creosote-bursage ecosystem that is widespread here. A generally reclusive reptile, the Mojave desert tortoise uses the protective cover of underground burrows to escape extreme desert conditions and as shelter from predators.\nOther amphibians and reptiles also make their homes in Gold Butte. For example, once considered extinct and now a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act, the relict leopard frog has been released into spring sites in the area in a collaborative effort by local, State, and Federal entities to help revive this still very small population. The banded Gila monster, the only venomous lizard in the United States, has also been recorded in Gold Butte. Many other reptile species—including the banded gecko, California kingsnake, desert iguana, desert night lizard, glossy snake, Great Basin collared lizard, Mojave green rattlesnake, sidewinder, Sonoran lyre snake, southern desert horned lizard, speckled rattlesnake, western leaf-nosed snake, western long-nosed snake, and western red-tailed skink—also have populations or potential habitats in the area.\nThe Gold Butte area serves as an effective corridor between Lake Mead and the Virgin Mountains for large mammals, including desert bighorn sheep and mountain lions. Smaller mammals in Gold Butte include white-tailed antelope squirrel, desert kangaroo rat, and the desert pocket mouse. Several species of bat, including the Pallid bat, Allen's big-eared bat, western pipistrelle bat, and the Brazilian free-tailed bat, are also found here, as well as the northern Mojave blue butterfly.\nBald and golden eagles, red-tailed and Cooper's hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts soar above Gold Butte. Closer to the ground, one can spot a variety of birds, including the western burrowing owl, common poorwill, Costa's hummingbird, pinyon jay, Bendire's thrasher, Virginia's warbler, Lucy's warbler, black-chinned sparrow, and gray vireo. Migratory birds, including the Calliope hummingbird, gray flycatcher, sage sparrow, lesser nighthawk, ash-throated flycatcher, and the Brewer's sparrow, also make stop-overs in the area. These birds, and a variety of other avian species, use the diversity of habitats in the area to meet many of their seasonal, migratory, or year-round life cycle needs.\nIn addition to providing homes to modern species of plants and wildlife, the area shows great potential for continued paleontological research, with resources such as recently discovered dinosaur tracks dating back to the Jurassic Period. These fossil trackways were found in Gold Butte's distinctive Aztec Sandstone and also include prints from squirrel-sized reptilian ancestors of mammals.\nThe protection of the Gold Butte area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the historic and scientific values of this area, and its many objects of historic and of scientific interest, remain for the benefit of all Americans.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve the objects of scientific and historic interest on the Gold Butte lands;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Gold Butte National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 296,937 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nAll Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.\nThe establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights, including valid existing water rights. If the Federal Government subsequently acquires any lands or interests in lands not owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, and objects identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests in lands shall be part of the monument, upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government.\nThe Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the monument pursuant to applicable legal authorities, which may include the provisions of section 603 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1782) governing the management of wilderness study areas, to protect the objects identified above. Of the approximately 296,937 acres of Federal lands and interests in lands reserved by this proclamation, approximately 285,158 acres are currently managed by the Secretary through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and approximately 11,779 are currently managed by the Secretary through the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). After issuance of this proclamation, the Secretary shall, consistent with applicable legal authorities, transfer administrative jurisdiction of the BOR lands within the boundaries of the monument to the BLM. The Secretary, through the BLM, shall manage lands within the monument that are subject to the administrative jurisdiction of the BLM as a unit of the National Landscape Conservation System.\nFor purposes of protecting and restoring the objects identified above, the Secretary, through the BLM, shall prepare and maintain a management plan for the monument and shall provide for maximum public involvement in the development of that plan including, but not limited to, consultation with State, tribal, and local governments.\nThe Secretary shall establish an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App., to provide information and advice regarding development of the land use plan and management of the monument.\nExcept for emergency or authorized administrative purposes, motorized vehicle use in the monument shall be permitted only on roads designated as open to such use as of the date of this proclamation, unless the Secretary decides to reroute roads for public safety purposes or to enhance protection of the objects identified above. Non-motorized mechanized vehicle use shall be permitted only on roads and trails, consistent with the care and management of the objects identified above.\nConsistent with the care and management of the objects identified above, nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to preclude the renewal or assignment of, or interfere with the operation, maintenance, replacement, modification, or upgrade within the physical authorization boundary of existing flood control, pipeline, and telecommunications facilities, or other water infrastructure, including wildlife water catchments or water district facilities, that are located within the monument. Except as necessary for the care and management of the objects identified above, no new rights-of-way shall be authorized within the monument.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to enlarge or diminish the rights or jurisdiction of any Indian tribe.

Although obstacles and challenges along the way can be discouraging, the mentorship and support of others have always motivated our people to persevere—even in the toughest of times. At the start of each new year, we observe National Mentoring Month to honor the parents, families, teachers, coaches, and mentors who pour their time and their love into lifting up America's daughters and sons.\nNobody succeeds on their own: each young person's strength and resilience is fostered by those who have taught them they can do anything they put their mind to. Whether helping mentees study for a test, learn a new skill, or lift their heads up after a setback, mentors provide them the chance they need to move forward and set their sights even higher. And in helping mentees achieve their goals, mentors can inspire them to reach back and provide the same support to someone else in need of a mentor. To learn how you can mentor others and make a lasting difference, visit www.Serve.gov/Mentor.\nIn too many communities, many children still have the odds stacked against them, which is why my Administration has striven to increase mentorship opportunities across our country. Among other steps we have taken, we established the My Brother's Keeper initiative, which has inspired private organizations and communities in every State to address opportunity gaps and encourage mentorship as a tool for helping all young people reach their full potential. At the White House, we started our own mentee program and regularly met with local youth to provide leadership and guidance. And our efforts to bring higher education within reach for more Americans and expand apprenticeship initiatives have helped ensure more students can access the educational and career opportunities they need to thrive.\nThis month, we reflect on the transformative role mentorship can play and acknowledge the many ways that mentors have helped our next generation of leaders and innovators grow. As a Nation, we are stronger when every individual has the opportunity to contribute to our American story. By working to give each person a better chance at success, we can unlock their potential and empower them to serve others in the same way.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2017 as National Mentoring Month. I call upon public officials, business and community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-28", "title": "Proclamation 9560—National Mentoring Month, 2017"}

The courageous individuals who rejected such cruelty helped us overcome one of the most painful chapters in our history as we worked to realize the promise of equality and justice for all. But today, in too many places around the world—including right here in the United States—the injustice of modern slavery and human trafficking still tears at our social fabric. During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we resolve to shine a light on every dark corner where human trafficking still threatens the basic rights and freedoms of others.\nFrom factories and brothels to farms and mines, millions of men, women, and children in the United States and around the world are exploited for their bodies and their labor. Whether through violence, deceit, or the promises of a better life, some of the most vulnerable populations among us—including migrants and refugees fleeing conflict or disaster, homeless LGBT youth, Alaska Native and American Indian women and girls, and children in poverty—are preyed upon by human traffickers. In order to rid the world of modern slavery we must do everything in our power to combat these violations of human decency.\nThe United States has pursued efforts to address these crimes and lift up individuals who have suffered unspeakable abuse at the hands of traffickers. Through the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, we have joined with the private sector, faith communities, law enforcement, and advocates to coordinate efforts to prevent trafficking and protect victims. Focusing on an agenda that prioritizes victim services, the rule of law, procurement of supplies, and increasing public awareness, the Task Force has strengthened Federal efforts to end human trafficking. In 2012, I issued an Executive Order to strengthen protections against human trafficking in Federal contracting, and nearly a year ago, I signed legislation that strengthened our ability to prevent products made with forced labor, including child labor, from entering American markets.\nWe must address the consequences of human trafficking and work to tackle its root causes. This past fiscal year, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice provided more than $60 million to community-based organizations and task forces to assist human trafficking victims, and since the beginning of my Administration, we have nearly tripled the number of victims connected to services. The Department of Homeland Security has also taken steps to streamline immigration procedures for trafficking victims and ensure their regulations are consistent with existing law. And through new Victims of Crime Act regulations, Federal funds can now be used to help human trafficking victims with their housing. Through the White House Council on Women and Girls, we have worked to address the sexual abuse-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately affects those especially vulnerable to sex trafficking—including young women and girls of color. And the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking—comprised of 11 human trafficking survivors of diverse backgrounds and experiences—recently released its first set of recommendations for combating human trafficking while keeping survivor perspectives in mind. Every action we take at home, from the clothing we wear to the food we eat, is connected to what happens around the world. As a Nation, we have worked to address the problem of forced labor in our supply chains, and as individuals, we must strive to be conscientious consumers. Working with our friends and allies, we have made this issue an international priority. Just this year we used multilateral fora, including the North American Leaders Summit, the East Asia Summit, and the United Nations, to raise awareness and work with partners around the globe. In addition to urging other countries to develop and expand their anti-trafficking laws and services for victims, we are also stepping up our foreign assistance in this area. Working alongside the international community, we have seen significant increases in trafficking prosecutions and convictions, and we have made great strides in supporting victims.\nAs leaders in the global undertaking to end the exploitation of human beings for profit, we must always remember that our freedom is bound to the freedom of others. This month, let us find inspiration in America's progress toward justice, opportunity, and prosperity for all and reaffirm our pledge to continue fighting for human rights around the world.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2017 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1. I call upon businesses, national and community organizations, families, and all Americans to recognize the vital role we must play in ending all forms of slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-28", "title": "Proclamation 9561—National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2017"}

Posing risks to both the physical and emotional health of victims, stalking is recognized as a crime across our Nation. This month, we join together in support of victims to raise awareness of this threat and reaffirm the importance of ensuring every person can live free from fear of violence, harassment, and any form of stalking.\nApproximately 1 in 6 women and 1 in 19 men will be victims of stalking. Perpetrators of stalking seek power and control by following, harassing, or pursuing victims in unwanted or repeated ways. Stalking can occur digitally—through cell phones and on social media platforms—as well as in person through repeated threats or acts of physical violence. And whether committed by acquaintances, former partners, or strangers, stalking can cause anxiety, depression, and feelings of helplessness, as well as a wide variety of general health and sleeping problems. Stalking victims live with the fear of not knowing what will happen next, and many are often forced to change their daily activities, move to a different location, or take time off from school or work.\nAlong with combating domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault, confronting stalking and supporting victims is an important part of my Administration's efforts to end violence against women. And to ensure that violence against women, including stalking, is never tolerated, Vice President Biden has also led efforts to help change this culture. In 2013, I signed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which identifies stalking as a key focus area in which we can improve support for victims. Because of an Executive Order I signed in 2015, victims employed by Federal contractors can now use paid sick leave for absences related to stalking, and in the past year, many Federal agencies have also increased their support for victims as part of ongoing work to address the effects of domestic violence in the workplace. The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently finalized a new rule that strengthens housing protections for stalking victims, helping to secure their basic right to a safe living environment. And through a new Government-wide training tool designed to educate Federal employees on how to recognize and respond to stalking—and how to support colleagues who may be victims—we have worked to enhance policies that support affected employees.\nNobody should ever feel unsafe in their homes and communities, which is why we must work to lift up victims and survivors who know the distress and anxiety of being stalked. Throughout National Stalking Awareness Month, let us reaffirm the value of privacy and security for all as we continue striving to ensure offenders are held accountable. If we pursue such progress and change with the passion and empathy that victims of stalking deserve, we can build a future where all people are free to live out their dreams.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2017 as National Stalking Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to learn the signs of stalking, acknowledge stalking as a serious crime, and urge those affected not to be afraid to speak out or ask for help. Let us also resolve to support victims and survivors, and to create communities that are secure and supportive for all Americans.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-12-28", "title": "Proclamation 9562—National Stalking Awareness Month, 2017"}

STROH: Thank you very much and, everyone, thanks for joining our call this afternoon. This will be a background press conference call on the administration response to Russian malicious cyber activity and harassment. I will introduce the senior administration officials that we have here on the call, but as a reminder, they'll be referred to on background as senior administration officials. And secondly, we'll embargo the content of this call until the call concludes, so please no tweeting or filing while the call is ongoing.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, everybody. I'll just make some brief comments and then turn it over to my other colleagues.\nSo today's actions were all approved by President Obama as a package of steps that is in response to very disturbing Russian threats to U.S. national security. And we're responding here to a pattern of Russian behavior that has been evident over some time.\nFirst of all, as you are all aware, in October, we took the very unique step of publicly attributing efforts to interfere in the U.S. election to Russia. And as you know, we've continued to refine and develop our assessment of those Russian efforts and, as President Obama has directed, there will be a report issued summarizing what we know with respect to those efforts. And we can talk about that later in the Q&A.\nIn addition, as my State colleague can speak to, we've seen other Russian actions that aim to directly interfere with the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, particularly a pattern of harassment of our diplomats inside of Russia. So the range of actions announced today are in response to those Russian provocations and actions. They include a set of sanctions that my colleague from Treasury can speak to, include some important efforts that we're taking with respect to cybersecurity and attribution, and include some actions against some of the Russian personnel and facilities here in the United States. And, again, each of my colleagues will speak to the unique actions taken.\nI would just add this is not the sum total of everything that we are doing in response to Russia's actions, including its malicious cyber activities and its interference in our election. As President Obama and others have said, some of those actions will be public and some of them will not. And today, we are announcing a series of the public measures that we're taking, but that should not be mistaken for the sum total of our response.\nI'd also note that this should come as no surprise to the Russian government, given that we have warned publicly and privately, including directly from President Obama to President Putin, that there would be a response for these Russian actions. So, again, we've been very clear about our intent here.\nThe only other thing I'd say by way of an introduction is that this really serves two purposes. One, there has to be a cost and a consequence for what Russia has done. It is an extraordinary step for them to interfere in the democratic process here in the United States of America, and there needs to be a price for that. They need to be held accountable for that. And we believe that this should be of concern to all Americans, as the President said in his statement and to members of Congress from both parties, because this was an attack on our democratic system, and we're responding in kind.\nSecondly, we also believe that these steps are important because Russia is not going to stop. We have every indication that they will continue to interfere in democratic elections in other countries, including some of our European allies. There's no reason to believe that they will not try to interfere in future American elections, be they state and local elections, midterm elections, or future presidential elections. And so we also need to publicize what we know about who is responsible, demonstrate that there's a cost, try to reveal what we know about how Russia operates in this space. And, again, more of that information will be in the report that the President has directed be prepared, but some of that is embedded in the response that we're taking today.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to my colleague to talk through the sanctions in particular.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. The number of significant actions that the President took and that Treasury has taken today -- first, I wanted to note that the President has amended the Cyber Executive Order, and that's an executive order that he issued originally in April of last year, which was meant to target malicious cyber activity by state or non-state actors anywhere in the world who were tampering with the infrastructure, who were disrupting the ability of networks of computers -- for example, through DDoS attacks -- or who were misappropriating funds -- basically cyber -- or cyber theft of intellectual property for commercial gain.\nThe single prong that the President has added today makes clear that we will -- future administrations will have the authority to go after those who are tampering with or misappropriating through cyber means with the purpose or effect of interfering with election processes. And that's basically the progress the President is -- on with the actions today.\nUnder this new authority, the President has sanctioned nine entities and individuals. First and foremost, two Russian intelligence services -- the GRU and the FSB -- four individual officers of the GRU who are the senior-most ranking leaders of the GRU, as well as three companies -- Russian companies that have provided material support to the GRU's cyber operation. Those companies are the Special Technology Center St. Petersburg, Zorsecurity, and the Autonomous Noncommercial Organization, which is often known by its acronym, ANO PO KSI -- all of which have provided cyber services and training to the GRU.\nIn addition to the actions taken by the President under the -- executive order, Treasury is targeting two Russian individuals, Evgeniy Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, under the preexisting cyber EO. In both cases, they're notorious cyber criminals who have been responsible for major (inaudible) and havoc in the international financial system, including against American companies.\nBogachev and the cyber criminals associated have been responsible for the theft of over $100 million -- U.S. financial institutions, as well as Fortune 500 (audio drop) universities and government agencies. And Belan has been responsible for compromising at least three major e-commerce companies and misappropriating the data, including private identifying data, from those companies.\nAs all of these actions make clear, we will not tolerate the abuse of our systems, including our election systems, by foreign actors. And these authorities are standing authorities that can be drawn upon in the future, as well.\nI'll now turn it over to my colleague.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. I wanted to talk with you all about the Joint Analysis Report that we issued today along with the FBI. As you know, on October 7th of this year, DHS and the DNI issued a joint statement that attributed the compromise of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including a U.S. political organization, and the subsequent disclosure of those emails to the Russian government.\nSo today, with this Joint Analysis Report, we are expanding on that statement and providing details on the tools and the infrastructure used by the Russian military and civilian intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the recent election, and -- to include state-owned voter registration databases, as well as a range U.S. government political and private sector entities.\nAnd a key objective in the release of this information today, of course, is to -- particularly the technical124 information is to better help network defenders in the United States and abroad to identify, detect and disrupt Russia's global campaign of malicious cyber activities.\nThe establishment of the attributions back to the Russian intelligence service is based on a U.S. government assessment that incorporates the technical information that's included in this JAR, the Joint Analysis Report, as well as the intelligence information and collection. Russia's civilian and military intelligence services have been engaged in aggressive and sophisticated cyber-enabled operations targeting the U.S. government and its citizens for a number of years. We are referring to this set of malicious cyber activity as GRIZZLY STEPPE -- and that's S-T-E-P-P-E -- and that becomes relevant for things like finding this JAR on the -- on our website. You can find it at US-CERT -- that's C-E-R-T -- .gov/grizzlysteppe. So again, that's G-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y-S-T-E-P-P-E, all one word.\nThese operations that we're describing in the JAR included spear-phishing campaigns, which have targeted government organizations, political infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations. Theft of information from these organizations and, specifically, recently, the public release of that information in operation of targeting other countries, including U.S. allies and partners -- Russian intelligence services have undertaken damaging or disruptive cyberattacks, including on critical infrastructure, in some cases, masquerading as a third parties or hiding behind false online personas which are designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack.\nThe JAR itself provides technical indicators that are related to many of these operations. Importantly, it lays out in an extended section of the JAR recommended mitigations, and, equally important, information on how to report incidents or detection of malicious indicators or activities to the U.S. government.\nThe JAR does recognize that some really excellent work has been done already by security companies and the private sector networks' owners or operators themselves. And some of this information is -- they have provided previously. But we are also providing new indicators of compromised malicious infrastructure identified during our own course of investigations and incident response, along with the Bureau. Again, we're focused on providing network defenders with the tools they need to identify and detect and disrupt Russian malicious activity targeting our country's networks.\nSo again, in the JAR itself, we have provided some descriptions of approaches that Russian intelligence services used, as well as some of the technical indicators, including Internet protocol addresses, the set of numbers that basically serves as an address for each computer in their use to transmit data to and between computers. These IT addresses are -- reflect infrastructure that the Russian intelligence services are using, and oftentimes it's other people's networks without the owner's knowledge. And they do that, obviously, to hide their malicious activity, but that means that these addresses also host, oftentimes, legitimate websites and other Internet services. And so we are providing this information for network defenders, network administrators to be able to use to try to detect and put on their watch list so that they can be alert to potential malicious activity.\nWe've also released -- it's not included in the JAR, but separately we've released two malware samples that Russian intelligence services use to broadly conduct their malicious activities, and we've given those to antivirus vendors so that they can be used to help, again, both private sector and government folks defend their networks.\nWe've provided a subseries of questions that companies need to be asking themselves, as well as a list of steps that they can take, some basic cyber hygiene practices that are really important and can actually stop 85 percent of the malicious activity that we see. We're going to continue our NCCIC, our National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center, to look at the research and analysis, and we will continue to issue subsequent updates to the JAR if and when additional information becomes available.\nAnd so we really urge that folks out there continue to check the US-CERT website and, again, both implement these recommended mitigations, but also provide information to the government to help fill in the bigger picture. What we're asking the companies to do is to take this technical information, go back through their logs and see if they see indications of this malicious activity in the past. Because knowledge of these historical incidents -- even if the bad actors are no longer active in your system -- it's important for the government to know about it and understand it. It helps to fill in the bigger picture, provides greater insight into the scope and scale of Russian activity, and helps all the network defenders.\nDHS has added these indicators to the automated information sharing that we have implemented this year, which provides them to companies that sign up at machine speed. And so we encourage companies to continue to sign up to receive those indicators.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, I'm here at State. You all saw the statement that we put out earlier today with the other interagency statements on the President's decisions. We implemented two of his decisions. We declared persona non grata 35 Russian officials operating in the U.S. who were acting in a manner inconsistent with their diplomatic and consular duties. And we also have denied Russian personnel access to two Russian-owned compounds in the United States. And this is part of the comprehensive response to their interference in our elections and a pattern of harassment. I have some details on the harassment, as well, but maybe I'll stop there. I've got details on the harassment for later in the conversation.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Great. Any of you guys want to say -- before we open to questions?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would just add that the actions inconsistent with their responsibilities and duties that my colleague referred to were intelligence activities. And the two facilities which the Russians are now denied access to were used for intelligence collection activities, as well.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And I would just add that from our view, the purpose of the indicator release is really twofold. One is to put the weight of the U.S. government behind the attribution of a lot of this activity to the Russian government and their intelligence services so that network defenders should prioritize fixing those issues and identifying that, because that is sponsored by a government that is carrying out malicious aggressive activity against us. And two, to cause them some operational friction and inhibit their ability, at least for a little while, to carry out their activities and to cause them some problems.\nQ Hi, thanks very much. Can you comment broadly on how difficult it would be or easy it might be for President-elect Trump to undo some of the things that you've been announcing today? And specifically how difficult or easy would it be for him to allow some of the officials back into the country who are being asked to leave?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll start and see if any of my colleagues want to weigh in.\nFirst of all, we're taking these actions consistent with our assessment of what Russia has done. To be very clear here, they have been interfering in both the American democratic process and in the conduct of American diplomacy. And so this should be of concern to all Americans -- again, to members of both parties, members of Congress from both parties. This has been a sustained effort to both harass our diplomatic personnel and interfere in our democratic process. And as I said, we have no reason to believe that Russia's activities will cease.\nThey have been engaged in malicious cyber activity for some time now. They have interfered in democratic elections not just here in the United States, but other countries. So one reason why I think that it is necessary to sustain these actions is because there's every reason to believe that Russia will interfere in future U.S. elections and future elections around the world.\nThat said, to your question, these are executive actions. So if a future President decided that he wanted to allow in a large tranche of Russian intelligence agents, presumably a future President could invite that action. We think it would be inadvisable. As my colleague just said, these diplomatic compounds were being used for intelligence purposes. That is a direct challenge to U.S. national security, and I don't think it would make much sense to reopen Russian intelligence compounds.\nSecondly, the officials who have been PNGed are Russian intelligence agents. So I don't think it would make much sense to invite back in Russian intelligence agents. The officials who were sanctioned were participating in malicious cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure and interfering in our democratic process. So, again, hypothetically you could reverse those sanctions, but it wouldn't make a lot of sense.\nI don't know if any of my colleagues have anything they want to add to that.\nQ You've made reference at several points to attacks on critical infrastructure in the U.S., and I was wondering does that include the campaign against U.S. companies in 2014, U.S. energy companies? And does it also include other things that you could identify?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Certainly, so I think in broad terms we know that the Russian government has targeted critical infrastructure around the world, and it is part of their normal operating procedures. And if you look at the list of malware and other kinds of activity that are listed in the JAR as being tied to the Russian intelligence services, you would see some of those that are aimed at critical infrastructure, such as BlackEnergy and Havex. So that's the kind of activity that we're talking about.\nQ Thank you for doing the call. First of all, I was wondering if you could talk about the chronology of the way you're doing this. Russia has been saying for weeks now if you guys really have evidence that we were behind this, prove it, show us what you have. And so why are you doing the announcement of these retaliatory actions before you're releasing this report that the President has promised that ostensibly would back up the accusations that you've made?\nAnd then for State, you guys are saying that the actions to kick out the diplomats and shutter these compounds are related to harassment, which is kind of a separate issue, but you're rolling it out as part of this big package. So is it fair to say that the decision to move forward with those penalties now is part of your attempt to be tougher on Russia over the cyber actions? Thanks.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, let me just start on that. On your second question, I think for the -- we've been looking at the issue of how to respond to the harassment of our diplomats for some time, but the fact is it's hard for us to separate that from the context of a foreign power also interfering in our democratic election.\nSo it's fair to say that President Obama's direction was that we should look at these actions as interconnected, and that the same hostile posture and the same flagrant violation of basic norms of international behavior that guided their harassment of our diplomatic personnel are also seen in the interference in our election. So again, that's why we looked at this as a package. And, frankly, if you look at the actions taken with respect to the diplomatic personnel and facilities, they were also related to an intelligence purpose. So just as it was a Russian intelligence effort that was tied to the interference in our election, we see a nexus to Russian intelligence and the actions taken by the State Department today in addition to the response of the harassment of our diplomats. And my State colleague can speak to the harassment of diplomats.\nOn your first question, look, we don't -- we actually, as you know, publicly put out the assessment that Russia was interfering in our election in early October. So we have been public with that assessment for some time now. Frankly, if you look at who is designated and what entities are designated and what's in the JAR, you begin to get a sense of our assessment of how Russia approached those issues. And what we'll be doing in the report that the President asked for is look comprehensively at the information that we have and the analysis that flows from that information.\nThis is not in question, though. There's no debate in the U.S. administration about the fact -- and it is a fact -- that Russia interfered in our democratic election. We've established that clearly to our satisfaction. I would never expect Russia to come out with their hands up and acknowledge what they did. They don't do that. They didn't do that -- they still deny that they are intervening in eastern Ukraine. And, frankly, I'd say to journalists, let's look at what they say and what they do. This is a country that has intervened in a sovereign country and denied that they did it, even though everybody could see that they were doing it, with respect to Ukraine; that has bombed civilians in Syria while denying that they were doing it.\nSo we don't see this as a he said, she said situation, we see this as, there are facts and then there are things that Russia says.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would also add, and maybe my colleague can speak to this more directly, but the process of putting together sanctions packages is extremely onerous and requires evidence that can stand up in court. So this is a very intense, elaborate process with a lot of input from agencies across the board.\nWe don't need to tell the Russian government what it's been doing. It knows what it's doing. We owe it to the American people to explain what the Russian government is doing, and the President's instruction for the U.S. government to do a report on what happened is exactly directed at explaining to the American people what happened. But we don't need to make the case to the Russians, for all the reasons that my colleague has laid out.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: State, you may want to talk about the harassments.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, the pattern of harassment over several years is really disturbing, and we felt -- and were pleased with the President's decision to do something about it.\nThey have -- you saw the YouTube video of the June 6th incident where our diplomat was assaulted by a Russian police officer. Embassy officials have been harassed and detained on their routine diplomatic travels around the country. Russian state-owned television has put some of our diplomats at risk by putting personal details about them on TV. They've blocked our ability to make our consulate general in St. Petersburg safe, in terms of the perimeter of security and new construction. They've closed 28 American Corners around the country and the American Center, which is making it impossible for us to do our job in terms of culture, education, and people-to-people ties.\nSo a whole series of pattern of actions over a number over years is what triggered this part of the decision.\nQ Hi, thanks for doing this. Just to be clear here, the Russians that are being expelled from here and denied access to these -- you called them recreational compounds -- are you saying, one, these very intelligence officers are involved, or is that something they -- out of Moscow? And two, are you talking about a compound within the embassy compound or someplace else, say in Washington?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can speak to that, but I believe my colleague would be best positioned to do so.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The compounds are not part -- are not contiguous with the embassy. One is in Maryland and one is in New York. They are compounds that the Russian government owns and that they use for multiple purposes -- as described by my colleague, intelligence, but also recreational, as well. And under the Foreign Missions Act, we have the authority to restrict their access to these properties based on their pattern of behavior.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And just to be absolutely clear, there are 35 Russian diplomats -- actually intelligence officers -- who were PNGed by State. The denial of access to the two compounds is all Russian personnel. The Russian missions in Washington, in New York -- all Russian personnel will be denied access to those two compounds beginning at noon tomorrow, or December 30th. And those who were PNGed have 72 hours from the moment of having been informed to leave. So they should be gone, by my calculation, that would be Sunday -- by noon on Sunday. And for the Russian speakers among you, I will wish you s novym godom.\nQ Thanks very much. First of all, President-elect Trump said on Wednesday that we ought to \"get on with our lives\" when asked about sanctioning Russia. So there have been reports that some of the other actions, the not-public actions that were to be taken against Russia was going to be left to the next administration. Is that the case? Or are there other non-public actions that are already being taken? And is your decision -- will your decision in any way change based on the signals coming from the President-elect that he does not believe that this is a matter that should be pursued, the election matter itself?\nAnd would you describe the harassment against our diplomats in Moscow as unusual, or -- are you focused on the normal pattern of behavior, or is this unusual between us and the Russians in terms of what you've seen, as you just described?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So on your first question, as you've heard us say many times, our approach is that there's one President at a time, and that President Obama is going to execute the duties of his office until January 20th. And he is acting in what he believes to be the best interest of the United States.\nI'd say a couple of things. One is, there are any number of actions that we're taking -- some we announce, some we don't -- that will be in process as the next administration takes office. So again, there may be things that commence while we're in office in addition to what we're saying today. When the new administration takes office, it's entirely their judgment as to whether or not they continue down the course that we have set in a number of different areas.\nI guess what I'd suggest is that the Russian actions have been sustained over an extended period of time, and by any definition are against the national interests of the United States, not the interests of President Obama. The harassment of our diplomats -- which is not in line, frankly, with the way things have been in the past; it's been escalating steadily for some time -- is a direct threat to the ability of the United States of America to conduct diplomacy. And I would think that that would be of concern to future administrations.\nThe interference in our election is a pattern that we see in other Western democracies, including some of our closest allies. And I think future administrations would find it concerning if there are efforts to undermine the democracies of our closest allies in the world.\nWhat we've seen in general with their malicious cyber activity has targeted our critical infrastructure beyond even our election process. So I would think that the malicious cyber-targeting of American critical infrastructure would be of concern to future administrations. I'd note, from our own consultations, that this is an issue of great concern to American business, and so I would expect that future administrations would be concerned about the threat to the American economy from malicious Russian cyber activity.\nSo again, as I said earlier, some of the actions we're taking have to do with Russian intelligence efforts, which, again, are aimed at harming the national security of the United States. I would think that future administrations would be concerned about those efforts. If they aren't, then they should explain why, and they'll have the opportunity to explain why. But I think clearly we're taking these actions because of what has been a pattern of behavior over an extended period of time that we've seen replicated in other countries, and we believe it's the right approach to take.\nI don't know if my colleagues want to comment on the kind of historical perspective of harassment.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, my understanding -- and I'll leave it to my colleague -- but my understanding is the State Department assesses that the pattern of Russian harassment of our diplomatic mission in Russia is unprecedented for the post-Cold War era, that this really was a change in behavior in the last two or so years.\nBut I'll turn it over to my colleague for the authoritative comment.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Just to agree with you and my colleague, nothing to add from here. Exactly right.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I just want to emphasize that, of course, the Joint Analytic Report contains information also that does go beyond just the election's malicious cyber activity, and again, to highlight activity aimed at critical infrastructure but also other non-governmental organizations, really a broad campaign. And the list of actors and actor sets, and of malware, et cetera, including BlackEnergy and Havex, is an indication of how broad this campaign is and how serious it is.\nQ Thanks very much. Can you explain to us why these activities come -- why these actions come at the time that they do? There was obviously a debate about taking each of the steps that you've announced today prior to the election. There was -- there's obviously been concern about retaliation by the -- and escalation by the Russians. Can you say whether or not you believe in retrospect that you wish you had acted earlier? And can you also on just one factual issue tell us whether or not the facilities that you've closed in New York and Maryland you believe were just generally intelligence facilities, or whether they were used as part of the DNC and other hacking activity here?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Your second question obviously kind of gets pretty precise on intelligence equities, so I don't think we can speak to that.\nOn the timing question, look, I'd say there are a range of factors here. Number one, each one of these steps takes a different amount of time to prepare. As you know -- and my colleague can speak if he wants to -- sanctions packages are time consuming, as you're establishing both the basis for the action and then refining the target list. The JAR itself is a complex procedure, as we are putting together the information that we can share publicly that provides the best possible guidance about what we know. And then obviously, the response to the harassment is something we've been focused on for some time.\nSo a number of points. First of all, with respect to how this fit around the election, I think our first priority was to publicly disclose the information. So before we were going to take an action, the most important thing was to make public what we knew, and we did that on October 7th. And that was a fairly unique, if not unprecedented, step to come out with a common view of the U.S. intelligence community that a foreign power, Russia, was interfering in our election. So point one is getting out that information.\nWe also wanted to give a warning directly to the Russians accompanying that public message and also in private, which he did at numerous times, about the fact that we knew what they were doing, and that we would be preparing a response. And we therefore wanted to have them absorb that message and have that effect -- see how that affected their behavior.\nWe also, frankly, in the run-up to the election were very focused on securing the election itself. And we have no indication at all that the efforts included tampering with the vote. And so in terms of a priority for a lot of our cybersecurity efforts, we wanted to make sure that our election was secure. And the warning to Russia combined with our efforts to secure the voting process I think was a priority.\nLet's also bear in mind that even as we have made this disclosure and were preparing these steps, material had been hacked and was being released. So it's not as if that genie could be put back into the bottle. We were putting this together and preparing a response in the context in which this information had been shared with other parities and was being publicly released and widely reported on by our news media. So what we wanted to do then is methodically work through these different elements: What could we do on sanctions? How are we going to deal with Russia's diplomatic presence here in the United States? What are we doing with the JAR? And how are we preparing other elements? And that takes some amount of time to put together. And we also wanted to, again, do some of this as a package.\nSo I think the President has been very deliberate: Let's gather the information; when we had enough confidence to put it out, we released it publicly. We issued a warning. We worked to secure our election. We worked to develop these responses. When the responses were complete, we aligned them so that we would be doing this as a package. And that I think explains the nature of the timeline.\nI don't know if anybody wants to speak to individual components of that process in terms of how they were put together.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think I can just add that from the very start of when, even going back some time, we have been engaging diplomatically with the Russians and raising our concerns about their activity -- even if not all of that became public -- whenever we learn about or detect intrusions into companies or organizations, we do notifications to those companies, and we go and we tell them. DHS began ramping up its coordination, as my colleague was talking about, in order to make sure that we doing everything possible to secure the electoral infrastructure. We started that back in the summer.\nAll this has been building for some period of time. So it's not like all of these actions sort of popped in kind of right now out of the blue, they are really part of a long-term effort that we've been building over time to push back on this kind of Russian behavior, and they're setting the stage for the fact that we will have to continue to deter and push back on this kind of behavior going into the future.\nMR. STROH: All right. Thank you very much for participating in today's call and, as of now, the call is concluded and the embargo is lifted. Thanks, everyone. Have a nice day.\nEND 3:27 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122610", "text": "Today, President Obama authorized a number of actions in response to the Russian government's aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election in 2016. Russia's cyber activities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\nSanctioning Malicious Russian Cyber Activity\nIn response to the threat to U.S. national security posed by Russian interference in our elections, the President has approved an amendment to Executive Order 13964. As originally issued in April 2015, this Executive Order created a new, targeted authority for the U.S. government to respond more effectively to the most significant of cyber threats, particularly in situations where malicious cyber actors operate beyond the reach of existing authorities. The original Executive Order focused on cyber-enabled malicious activities that:\n•      Harm or significantly compromise the provision of services by entities in a critical infrastructure sector;\n•      Significantly disrupt the availability of a computer or network of computers (for example, through a distributed denial-of-service attack); or\n•      Cause a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain (for example, by stealing large quantities of credit card information, trade secrets, or sensitive information).\nThe increasing use of cyber-enabled means to undermine democratic processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia's recent activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to interfere with elections is also warranted. As such, the President has approved amending Executive Order 13964 to authorize sanctions on those who:\n•      Tamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\nUsing this new authority, the President has sanctioned nine entities and individuals: two Russian intelligence services (the GRU and the FSB); four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRU's cyber operations.\n•      The Main Intelligence Directorate (a.k.a. Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie) (a.k.a. GRU) is involved in external collection using human intelligence officers and a variety of technical tools, and is designated for tampering, altering, or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with the 2016 U.S. election processes.\n•      The Federal Security Service (a.k.a. Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti) (a.k.a FSB) assisted the GRU in conducting the activities described above.\n•      The three other entities include the Special Technology Center (a.k.a. STLC, Ltd. Special Technology Center St. Petersburg) assisted the GRU in conducting signals intelligence operations; Zorsecurity (a.k.a. Esage Lab) provided the GRU with technical research and development; and the Autonomous Noncommercial Organization \"Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems\" (a.k.a. ANO PO KSI) provided specialized training to the GRU.\n•      Sanctioned individuals include Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the current Chief of the GRU; Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, Deputy Chief of the GRU; Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, a First Deputy Chief of the GRU; and Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev, also a First Deputy Chief of the GRU.\nIn addition, the Department of the Treasury is designating two Russian individuals, Evgeniy Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, under a pre-existing portion of the Executive Order for using cyber-enabled means to cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information.\n•      Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev is designated today for having engaged in significant malicious cyber-enabled misappropriation of financial information for private financial gain. Bogachev and his cybercriminal associates are responsible for the theft of over $100 million from U.S. financial institutions, Fortune 500 firms, universities, and government agencies.\n•      Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan engaged in the significant malicious cyber-enabled misappropriation of personal identifiers for private financial gain. Belan compromised the computer networks of at least three major United States-based e-commerce companies.\nResponding to Russian Harassment of U.S. Personnel\nOver the past two years, harassment of our diplomatic personnel in Russia by security personnel and police has increased significantly and gone far beyond international diplomatic norms of behavior. Other Western Embassies have reported similar concerns. In response to this harassment, the President has authorized the following actions:\n•      Today the State Department declared 35 Russian government officials from the Russian Embassy in Washington and the Russian Consulate in San Francisco \"persona non grata.\" They were acting in a manner inconsistent with their diplomatic status. Those individuals and their families were given 72 hours to leave the United States.\n•      In addition to this action, the Department of State has provided notice that as of noon on Friday, December 30, Russian access will be denied to two Russian government-owned compounds, one in Maryland and one in New York.\nRaising Awareness About Russian Malicious Cyber Activity\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation are releasing a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) that contains declassified technical information on Russian civilian and military intelligence services' malicious cyber activity, to better help network defenders in the United States and abroad identify, detect, and disrupt Russia's global campaign of malicious cyber activities.\n•      The JAR includes information on computers around the world that Russian intelligence services have co-opted without the knowledge of their owners in order to conduct their malicious activity in a way that makes it difficult to trace back to Russia. In some cases, the cybersecurity community was aware of this infrastructure, in other cases, this information is newly declassified by the U.S. government.\n•      The report also includes data that enables cybersecurity firms and other network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian intelligence services use. Network defenders can use this information to identify and block Russian malware, forcing the Russian intelligence services to re-engineer their malware. This information is newly de-classified.\n•      Finally, the JAR includes information on how Russian intelligence services typically conduct their activities. This information can help network defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion.\nThis information will allow network defenders to take specific steps that can often block new activity or disrupt on-going intrusions by Russian intelligence services. DHS and FBI are encouraging security companies and private sector owners and operators to use this JAR and look back within their network traffic for signs of malicious activity. DHS and FBI are also encouraging security companies and private sector owners and operators to leverage these indicators in proactive defense efforts to block malicious cyber activity before it occurs. DHS has already added these indicators to their Automated Indicator Sharing service.\nCyber threats pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges the United States faces today. For the last eight years, this Administration has pursued a comprehensive strategy to confront these threats. And as we have demonstrated by these actions today, we intend to continue to employ the full range of authorities and tools, including diplomatic engagement, trade policy tools, and law enforcement mechanisms, to counter the threat posed by malicious cyber actors, regardless of their country of origin, to protect the national security of the United States.", "timestamp": "2016-12-29", "title": "Fact Sheet: Actions in Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment"}

These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian Government and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior.\nAll Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions. In October, my administration publicized our assessment that Russia took actions intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. These data theft and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian Government. Moreover, our diplomats have experienced an unacceptable level of harassment in Moscow by Russian security services and police over the last year. Such activities have consequences. Today I have ordered a number of actions in response.\nI have issued an Executive order that provides additional authority for responding to certain cyber activity that seeks to interfere with or undermine our election processes and institutions or those of our allies or partners. Using this new authority, I have sanctioned nine entities and individuals: the GRU and the FSB, two Russian intelligence services; four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRU's cyber operations. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is designating two Russian individuals for using cyber-enabled means to cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information. The State Department is also shutting down two Russian compounds, in Maryland and New York, used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes, and is declaring \"persona non grata\" 35 Russian intelligence operatives. Finally, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are releasing declassified technical information on Russian civilian and military intelligence service cyber activity to help network defenders in the United States and abroad identify, detect, and disrupt Russia's global campaign of malicious cyber activities.\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.", "timestamp": "2016-12-29", "title": "Statement on United States Actions in Response to Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment by the Russian Government"}

At a time when we turn the page on 1 year and look ahead to the future, I just wanted to take a minute to thank you for everything you've done to make America stronger these past 8 years.\nJust 8 years ago, as I prepared to take office, our economy teetered on the brink of depression. Nearly 800,000 Americans were losing their jobs each month. In some communities, nearly one in five folks were out of work. Almost 180,000 troops were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Usama bin Laden was still at large. And on challenges from health care to climate change, we'd been kicking the can down the road for way too long.\nEight years later, you've told a different story. We turned recession into recovery. Our businesses have created 15.6 million new jobs since early 2010, and we've put more people back to work than all other major advanced economies combined. A resurgent auto industry has added nearly 700,000 jobs and is producing more cars than ever. Poverty is falling. Incomes are rising. In fact, last year, folks' typical household income rose by $2,800, that's the single biggest increase on record, and folks at the bottom and middle saw bigger gains than those at the top.\nTwenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance. Our kids' high school graduation rate is at an alltime high. We've brought 165,000 troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and took out Usama bin Laden. Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program, opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, and brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our kids. Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did 8 years ago. And marriage equality is finally a reality from coast to coast.\nWe have made extraordinary progress as a country these past 8 years. And here's the thing: None of it was inevitable. It was the result of tough choices we made and the result of your hard work and resilience. And to keep America moving forward is a task that falls to all of us. Sustaining and building on all we've achieved—from helping more young people afford a higher education, to ending discrimination based on preexisting conditions, to tightening rules on Wall Street, to protecting this planet for our kids—that's going to take all of us working together. Because that's always been our story: the story of ordinary people coming together in the hard, slow, sometimes frustrating, but always vital, work of self-government.\nIt has been the privilege of my life to serve as your President. And as I prepare to take on the even more important role of citizen, know that I will be there with you every step of the way to ensure that this country forever strives to live up to the incredible promise of our founding: that all of us are created equal and all of us deserve every chance to live out our dreams.\nFrom the Obama family to yours, have a happy and blessed 2017.", "timestamp": "2016-12-31", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
