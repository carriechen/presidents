The First Lady and I are pleased to welcome Gail McGovern of the American Red Cross, David Hudson of the Salvation Army, and Kevin Ezell of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief. These people have been absolutely incredible at what they've done.\nI would like to thank them, and their staff and volunteers for the incredible work they're doing and in helping people affected by Hurricane Harvey. Sounds like a very innocent name but it's not an innocent hurricane, that I can tell you. It's of epic proportion.\nThese organizations and the many other non-profits involved represent the generosity, determination, and unbreakable spirit of the American people.\nAnd Mike Pence was there yesterday and represented his country so well, in the love and the care, and I had so many just great comments about your visit, so I appreciate it.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: When a disaster strikes, they work to help others in the time of need, which was over the last week, believe me. They've already provided tens of thousands of displaced Gulf Coast residents with meals, water, shelter, fresh blankets, and clean clothing.\nWhen one American suffers -- and I say this quite a bit, especially lately, when you see what's going on -- we all suffer. We're one American family brought together in times of tragedy by the unbreakable bonds of love and loyalty that we have for one another. And there is a great love and a great loyalty in this country, and I think we've all seen it, maybe more so than ever before over the last four days. So I think we really have seen it. Nowhere is our unity more evident than in the actions of our volunteer and charitable organizations that rally to their neighbors' aid when disaster strikes.\nThe people of Texas and Louisiana were hit very hard by a historic flood. In their response, they have taught us all a lesson -- a very, very powerful lesson: There was no outbreak in crime. There was an outbreak of compassion only -- real beautiful, strong compassion. And they've really inspired us as a nation. To be honest, they've inspired the world, because the world is watching.\nWe're pleased to receive an update from Gail, David, and Kevin on the work of the Red Cross, Salvation Army, and the Southern Baptist Disaster Relief. The federal government is on the ground bringing in significant resources to bear. And I want to assure these organizations and the others involved that we will continue to coordinate with them and bring all of the relief and the comfort and everything else that we absolutely can to the Gulf Coast.\nAnd I want to also thank the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Texas. They have been outstanding. Just the coordination and the level of relationship has been, I think, pretty much unprecedented. So I just want to thank them. I want to thank all of the folks working on the ground for the administration. Tom Bossert is here today. Tom, thank you very much, we appreciate it. Every American heart is with the people of Texas and Louisiana. They're strong and resilient, and they have really overcome.\nAnd we're in the process of just about, where I can I say, overcome this horrible devastation. Now it's going back to work, but the Coast Guard in particular, I have to also thank. They saved probably thousands of lives -- we were just talking about it -- going onto seas that very few people would want to be on in the worst of times, when they were saving a lot of people out there.\nTogether, we will help them all recover from this tragedy. We'll renew our hope and community, and we'll renew our hope and rebuild those homes, and businesses, and schools, and places of worship where the strength and vigor that comes from the love within our souls.\nAnd I just authorized and signed a proclamation for prayer. And we're going to have, on Sunday, a prayer Sunday. And, Mike, that was something that was very special, just took place. So I think it's going to be something to see and to witness. It's been a long time. And our country deserves it right now.\nI want to thank my wife, Melania, the First Lady. She's been so involved in this and helping so much. And so I want to thank you. Would you like to say a few words to start off?\nMRS. TRUMP: It's great to be here with amazing people, and I want to thank all the volunteers all across the country dedicated to help to Texas -- and fantastic job. And we're going tomorrow to visit them, and I just want to tell them to be strong and everything will be okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT: See, I didn't tell her I was going to do that, Stewart. And she did a great job. (Laughter.) But she really has; she's been so dedicated to this. This has very much affected her, what's happened in Texas and neighboring states, frankly.\nSo I want thank you, First Lady. Thank you.\nSalvation Army.\nCOMMISSIONER HUDSON: Yes, well, we're first of all very appreciative of this opportunity, appreciative of our partners in service. We are working hand-in-hand with groups like the Red Cross, where they provide shelter for people, and we're able to provide meals. And even though we're limited in being able to get in to a lot of the impacted areas, we've already served hundreds of thousands of meals, and literally millions of meals will be served.\nAnd we can only do this as we partner together. And as I've told my coworkers, this is a time that we're all Texans. And no matter where you're from, we're all about serving Americans in need. And I'd like to thank you, Mr. President, the Red Cross, and the Baptists and all the other agencies that partner with us. Together we can make a difference.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. That's very nice.\nSouthern Baptists.\nMR. EZELL: We're three different organizations, but we work best as one. And the joy of this is we really do lock arms and have the capacity to feed over 400,000 people a day. And, Mr. President, thank you for FEMA. They've been incredible through this. We've gone through many disasters, and they've done just a fantastic job stepping to the plate and being prepared and allowing us to volunteer (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we should thank Brock Long and all of the people at FEMA, and the people at Homeland and, I have to say General Kelly, who has been so much involved. As you know he just left, and he's now in the White House. But his spirit and anything else that's been involved over the last few weeks getting ready. Because, really, this has been probably now almost two weeks since we felt that it was probably going to hit that area. But General Kelly has done a fantastic job. And Elaine Duke has been terrific. So I want to thank all of our folks.\nRed Cross, how are we doing?\nMS. McGOVERN: Sir, first of all, our hearts go out the people of Texas, and on behalf of the entire American Red Cross, so many people have lost everything and presented in our shelters with just the clothes on their back. I visited one of the shelters outside of Austin, and it housed about 200 people. And I had the opportunity to call to all the families -- everyone from a six-month-old baby to a 6'8\" man -- and everybody in between.\nAnd you heard stories of heartbreak and heartache. But the one thing that I hadn't seen in the nine years that I've been with the American Red Cross is the incredible resiliency of the American people. They are bound and determined to build back, and there are about 40,000 people in our shelters right now across the state of Texas. And our volunteers are pouring in, giving them comfort, hope. We served about 390,000 meals and snacks. And the incredible thing is our partners are there. They are getting the hot meals into our hands so that we can serve them.\nGovernment has just been phenomenal. And when we had a hard time getting our volunteers in, the city gave us dump trucks so we could get volunteers and cots in. The Department of Defense gave us high-water vehicles -- 20 of them -- so we could break in and bring needed supplies.\nSo I'm just so appreciative of the teamwork. I'm appreciative of your support. And again, our hearts go out to the people of Texas.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Very nice. 390,000 --\nMS. McGOVERN: Meals and snacks.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And that's up until now. Just up to -- as of last night.\nTHE PRESIDENT: You'll be doubling that. That's a tremendous job.\nMS. McGOVERN: I'm quite sure we will.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Tremendous job.\nMike, would you like to say something?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Just, Mr. President, having -- I just returned from southeast Texas yesterday. We heard the resilience, the character, and the faith of the people of east Texas. We heard their gratitude to you and the First Lady for the administration's support, for your compassion, your admiration for our first responders from FEMA, down to local leadership.\nBut I also heard, Mr. President, about their gratitude for volunteer organizations that have literally been there from the very outset of this storm. And I want to thank you and the First Lady for taking the opportunity to call attention to the Salvation Army and the Red Cross and Southern Baptist Disaster Relief.\nAnyone looking on should know that while the federal government is going to be there at your direction, we'll be seeking resources from the Congress to make sure that disaster relief is available for individuals and businesses. Literally, the work of meeting people's human needs each and every day will take all of us, and these volunteer organizations need resources and they need people.\nAnd I would just add, Mr. President, that anyone looking on can go to NVOAD.org -- it's our website where all these organizations are listed. People can find out how they can be supportive of national volunteer organizations that at this very hour, and for weeks and months ahead, will be coming alongside families as they rebuild their lives.\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's good. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much.\nThis is just some of the locations that over a very short period of time, they and others have managed to go to some of these locations, as you know very well. Some of the press has been there, and I will say they are devastated. Two days ago there was water like nobody has ever seen before. I guess in the history of our country we've never had an amount of water like we've had. And yet you were able to occupy all of these different locations and take care of people -- you and the others.\nSo we want to just thank you. That's really a special, special job. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.\nQ: Do you think DACA is illegal? Do you think DACA is illegal? (Inaudible) later today, possibly?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We'll be releasing on DACA sometime over the weekend, probably Sunday, Saturday. Latest will be Monday. Great feeling for DACA.\nQ: Do you think it's illegal? DACA is illegal -- is that your sense?\nQ: Sir, will you be making the spending request today?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, we'll be making a request. Absolutely. For the state of Texas, yes -- and Louisiana.\nAnd tomorrow I'm going to Louisiana with the First Lady, and Texas. So it will be Texas, Louisiana.\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-09-01", "title": "Remarks in an Update from Disaster Relief Organizations on Hurricane Harvey Recovery Efforts"}

Americans have always come to the aid of their fellow countrymen. Friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, stranger helping stranger -- we've seen it perhaps more so than at any time, so vividly at least, during Hurricane Harvey.\nFrom the beginning of our nation, Americans have joined together in prayer during times of great need to ask for God's blessing and God's guidance. When we look across Texas and Louisiana, we see the American spirit of service embodied by countless men and women.\nBrave first responders have rescued those stranded in drowning cars and rising water, and I have to tell you that I've watched the Coast Guard -- thousands of lives have been saved by our great Coast Guard. They have done incredible work in the most vicious seas that they've seen in many, many years.\nFamilies have given food and shelter to those in need. Houses of worship have organized efforts to clean up communities and repair damaged homes. People have never seen anything quite like this. Individuals of every background are striving for the same goal: to aid and comfort people facing devastating losses. As Americans, we know that no challenge is too great for us to overcome -- no challenge.\nWe invite all Americans to join us as we continue to pray for those who have lost family members and friends, and for those who are suffering from this great crisis.\nAnd behind me, we have faith-based people who are highly respected, and especially so in their communities where they're not only respected, but they're loved -- evangelical leaders, Christian leaders -- many people of faith. And I just want to thank you all for being with us today because we're going to be signing a Day of Prayer, and that will be on Sunday. It will be a very special day. And I don't know when this was done last, but it's been a longtime coming. It's been a longtime coming.\nSo I'm going to sign it, and then a few of the folks will say a few words, and Pastor Jeffress will say a prayer for not only the people so affected -- so horribly affected by Hurricane Harvey, but for the people of the nation and, in fact, the people of our world.\n(The proclamation is signed.) (Applause.)\nWould somebody like to say a word or two to these very lovely people gathered before us?\nPASTOR MULLINS: Mr. President, we want to thank you for your leadership and for declaring this Day of Prayer that we desperately need in our nation.\nI was talking with some of the faith leaders on the ground in Houston today who are diligently working to not only rescue and help recover and restore these families. And they commented on the great cooperation that they're experiencing both from the local, state, and federal levels, and they wanted to send their heartfelt gratitude to you and to all of your team for the difference we're making in these people's lives.\nSo thank you for your leadership.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. That's very nice.\nPASTOR MULLINS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\nMR. REED: Mr. President, I think it goes without saying that in a moment like this, we all come together as Americans, we all bow to almighty God, we ask for his grace and his mercy over those who are affected. And we thank you, the Vice President, and your entire team -- FEMA -- everything you're doing to deploy every resource of government to help those who have been affected.\nAnd most of all, Mr. President, we thank you for acknowledging that ultimately it is God who is the source of our unity as Americans, and I thank you for issuing this proclamation.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\nPARTICIPANT: Mr. President, people of faith of all backgrounds know that prayer changes things. And a great work is done by anyone who calls a nation to prayer. If we want to give you thanks for calling us to prayer -- because no matter where we are, across whatever spectrum, we know that prayer changes things, and it unites a nation.\nSo thank you, sir, for uniting our nation and calling us to prayer.\nPASTOR JACKSON: I just wanted to add that, in our community, we have been praying. We started a 40-day fast for the healing of America and the solemn protection of God. There are some things that we have to make -- not diminishing your office -- but in appeals to a higher source. We've got to look to heaven. He will empower us, strengthen you, and give you wisdom.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\nDon't be shy. Since when are you shy?\nMR. BAUER: (Laughter.) I'm not shy, Mr. President. Mr. President, this is a great moment. The country has a lot of challenges; you know that as President. To ask the country to turn back to God, to pray, is just an incredible thing for a President to do. I guess George Washington was the first one to do it.\nA lot of Americans may have forgotten that the country was built on a moral idea. The second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence -- I know you know it: All men are created equal, endowed by their Creator -- that's God -- with certain unalienable rights, among these are right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nThat's what makes this a shining city that you're the honored President of, and reminding the American people that is amazing.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. I very much appreciate it. Anybody else? Anybody else?\nMR. PAGE: Well, thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: From the beginning. Go ahead.\nMR. PAGE: Yes, indeed. Thank you so much for your personal gift to the victims and our Southern Baptists and evangelicals and people of all faiths and no faith are out there helping one another.\nAnd we appreciate your example in going tomorrow to show the presence -- something called ministry of presence. Sometimes it just means something to be there for people, and I appreciate you already having been there and you're going again. I just deeply appreciate that, and it shows a connection with the people that is so needed. So I just personally want to say thank you. On behalf of Southern Baptists and Americans, thank you, Mr. President.\nPASTOR WHITE: I just thank you, sir, for calling on our nation to God, and it's been an honor to not only know you for 16 years, but to serve with your faith leaders. And you say that you always have put God first and you challenge us and continue to challenge us as you lead us. We thank you for your personal works. And this, I do believe, is a new beginning for us.\nAs we look forward, we are going to see great things come. Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\nPastor Jeffress, a prayer?\nPASTOR JEFFRESS: Let's pray together, may we?\n(A prayer is offered.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nQ: A decision on DACA, Mr. President? Can we expect one --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Sometime today or over the weekend we'll make a decision.\nQ: Should DREAMers be worried?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We love the DREAMers. We love everybody.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: We'll issue it sometime over the weekend. Maybe this afternoon.\nQ: Will you sign emergency funding --\nTHE PRESIDENT: We're working on emergency funding. We're doing everything we can and we're working very well with the Governor, who has done a terrific job.\nQ: What do you say to the DREAMers who are scared right now, who feel like they're going to be (inaudible)?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We think the DREAMers are terrific.

The storm has since devastated communities in both Texas and Louisiana, claiming many lives, inflicting countless injuries, destroying or damaging tens of thousands of homes, and causing billions of dollars in damage. The entire Nation grieves with Texas and Louisiana. We are deeply grateful for those performing acts of service, and we pray for healing and comfort for those in need.\nAmericans have always come to the aid of their fellow countrymen -- friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger -- and we vow to do so in response to Hurricane Harvey. From the beginning of our Nation, Americans have joined together in prayer during times of great need, to ask for God's blessings and guidance. This tradition dates to June 12, 1775, when the Continental Congress proclaimed a day of prayer following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and April 30, 1789, when President George Washington, during the Nation's first Presidential inauguration, asked Americans to pray for God's protection and favor.\nWhen we look across Texas and Louisiana, we see the American spirit of service embodied by countless men and women. Brave first responders have rescued those stranded in drowning cars and rising water. Families have given food and shelter to those in need. Houses of worship have organized efforts to clean up communities and repair damaged homes. Individuals of every background are striving for the same goal -- to aid and comfort people facing devastating losses. As Americans, we know that no challenge is too great for us to overcome.\nAs response and recovery efforts continue, and as Americans provide much needed relief to the people of Texas and Louisiana, we are reminded of Scripture's promise that \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\" Melania and I are grateful to everyone devoting time, effort, and resources to the ongoing response, recovery, and rebuilding efforts. We invite all Americans to join us as we continue to pray for those who have lost family members or friends, and for those who are suffering in this time of crisis.\nNow, therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 3, 2017, as a National Day of Prayer for the Victims of Hurricane Harvey and for our National Response and Recovery Efforts. We give thanks for the generosity and goodness of all those who have responded to the needs of their fellow Americans. I urge Americans of all faiths and religious traditions and backgrounds to offer prayers today for all those harmed by Hurricane Harvey, including people who have lost family members or been injured, those who have lost homes or other property, and our first responders, law enforcement officers, military personnel, and medical professionals leading the response and recovery efforts. Each of us, in our own way, may call upon our God for strength and comfort during this difficult time. I call on all Americans and houses of worship throughout the Nation to join in one voice of prayer, as we seek to uplift one another and assist those suffering from the consequences of this terrible storm.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

Many homes and communities have been destroyed, many lives have been upended, and tragically, some have lost their lives in this catastrophic storm.\nWe pray for the victims and their families—and all of those who have been displaced from their homes.\nAt this very moment, heroic efforts continue to keep safe those threatened by this natural disaster.\nI want to say a special word of thanks to our amazing first responders—our police and law enforcement officers, firefighters, Coast Guard, National Guard, EMS, doctors, nurses, hospital workers, and volunteers who have traveled from all across the country. Thousands of people have come together to prevent loss of life and ensure safety, and we are incredibly grateful for their courage, their professionalism, and their sacrifice.\nThey are an inspiration to all of us.\nTo the people affected by Hurricane Harvey: we are with you every single step of the way. We will help you recover. We will help you rebuild. We will support you today, tomorrow, and the day after.\nWe have been working closely with local authorities, and I remain in close communication with Governor Abbott of Texas and Governor Edwards of Louisiana.\nAt the request of Governor Abbott, I declared a major disaster in the State of Texas to ensure that federal aid is available for state and local recovery efforts. I also approved a disaster declaration for Louisiana.\nOrganizations like the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and faith-based organizations are actively assisting on the ground and they are doing a fantastic job. I want to recognize the millions of citizens across the country who are contributing in every way they can—with their time, their resources, and their prayers.\nWhen one part of America hurts, we all hurt. When we see neighbors in need, we rush to their aid. We don't ask their names or where they are from—we help our fellow Americans every single time.\nThis is the spirit of America. It is exactly what I saw while in Texas this week—a spirit of love, determination, and resolve. A spirit, that even when wounded, never gives up—never gives in—never loses hope. We just keep fighting—we just keep pushing on, for the people we love, and for the nation we call home.\nAll American hearts are with the people of Texas and Louisiana. We mourn and pray and struggle through the hardships—together.\nWe know that a long and difficult path lies ahead to get our neighbors back in their homes and on their feet. But we also know that we are stronger than the obstacles in our path. Arm-in-arm, we will strive, we will endure, and we will emerge stronger than ever before.\nThank you. God Bless You.

This month, we recommit ourselves to supporting every woman who bravely wages a battle of hope against this terrible disease.\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that more than 22,000 Americans will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2017. Unfortunately, about 14,000 women in the United States will lose their battle with ovarian cancer this year alone. If diagnosed and treated early, however, the five-year survival rate for women fighting this disease is more than 90 percent. Regular medical checkups and learning about the early warning signs of ovarian cancer can save lives.\nIn addition to raising awareness, we reaffirm our pledge to prevent, treat, and defeat ovarian and other forms of cancer. Innovative and cutting-edge research in women's health can transform cancer detection and lead to new treatments that are less debilitating and even more effective. This is why my Administration will continue to clear the way for incredible breakthroughs in medical science, including by working with Congress to implement the 21st Century Cures Act. So far this year, the Food and Drug Administration has approved two maintenance therapies for ovarian cancer, to help women who are battling this disease lead longer, happier lives.\nMelania joins me in sending our prayers to those affected by ovarian cancer, and we encourage every American to learn more about this important health issue.

The rate of new prostate cancer cases in the United States has fallen nearly 6 percent on average each year over the past decade. During this same time, the rate of deaths due to prostate cancer has also fallen by more than 3 percent on average each year. Men diagnosed with prostate cancer are living longer lives than ever thanks to innovative research and improvements in cancer treatment. Our Nation applauds these ongoing efforts to enhance the lives of Americans and provide comfort and support in the fight against cancer.\nNonetheless, in fighting prostate cancer, we are still mindful that it remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. My Administration remains dedicated to finding better diagnostic and treatment options through the 21st Century Cures Act, as well as research collaborations between the Department of Health and Human Services, private industry, and the academic community. In addition, the National Institutes of Health is investing in research that will improve upon current approaches to combatting prostate cancer. Through these efforts and others, American men can experience a healthier future.\nThis month, I encourage men to talk with their healthcare providers about their risk for prostate cancer.

Apologize for the delay -- I wanted to make sure the Governor of Texas was able to complete his briefing before we came out, and that you guys were able to pay attention to that.\nI'll keep it quick up here at the top so that we can get to your questions.\nThe President and his homeland security team, and the entire administration continue to focus on the lives and safety of those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana.\nYesterday, at the direction of the President, the Vice President and Mrs. Pence, Labor Secretary Acosta, Transportation Secretary Chao, Energy Secretary Perry, VA Secretary Shulkin, and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Duke traveled to Texas to speak with people on the ground and assess the damage.\nEarlier today, the President signed a proclamation declaring this Sunday a National Day of Prayer for those affected by the hurricane. And just this afternoon, the President heard from the heads of the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, and Southern Baptist Disaster Relief on their efforts throughout the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.\nAs Gail McGovern, President and CEO of the American Red Cross, said, the American people are \"bound and determined\" to bounce back, and these organizations, along with so many others, have been on the ground from the beginning helping the people of Texas and Louisiana do just that.\nThe President will be back in Texas tomorrow to visit with storm survivors and tell them personally that the federal government is here to help in any way that we can.\nThe President is currently finalizing a supplemental request to support the needs of emergency responders at the federal, state, and local level. And we'll share more information on that later.\nThe President has had calls with several foreign leaders who expressed their support for the American people during this difficult time. Just today, he spoke with the presidents of South Korea, Kazakhstan, and Colombia. And we'll have readouts coming on each of those calls later today.\nAnd I'd also like to take this opportunity to follow up on a question I was asked yesterday, and announce that the President will host the Emir of Kuwait at the White House on September 7th and the President of Spain on September 26th.\nFinally, I'd like to reiterate the message that Tom Bossert, the President's Homeland Security Advisor, gave yesterday. In case there is anyone watching today that is in need of assistance, once you have access to a functioning computer, please go to www.DisasterAssistance.gov. And if you have access to a working phone, please call 1-800-621-3362.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nQ: Sarah, you mentioned the supplemental. Does the President feel that it would be helpful to tie the supplemental to the vote on raising the debt ceiling? And do you have any details on the amount of the supplemental? There have been reports that it would be about $5.9 billion.\nMS. SANDERS: Right now, those details are being finalized, and we'll have more information shortly, most likely by the end of today.\nQ: What about the issue of tying the vote to the debt ceiling?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, those details are being finalized as we speak, and we should have something for you by the end of today.\nQ: So the President said that he would have a decision on DACA in the next couple of days. Can you talk a little bit about what are the factors driving that decision? What is he weighing right now? And also, does he think that the program, as it is designed now -- does he think it's illegal?\nMS. SANDERS: I just spoke with the President, and we're in the process of finalizing that decision and those details. And we're actually going to make that announcement on Tuesday of next week. And the President's priorities on immigration are to create a system that encourages legal immigration and benefits our economy and American workers.\nThe President has been very clear: He loves people, and he wants to make sure that this decision is done correctly. And so that's what he's doing now, is finalizing that part.\nQ: Can I ask a question that might help us understand what informs this decision? Does the President feel that young people who came to this country illegally, who came of age here, who have jobs here, went to school here, are those people Americans or are they foreign (inaudible)?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth while we're in the process of finalizing the details on this, but we're going to be working on that throughout the weekend and make that announcement on Tuesday.\nJohn.\nQ: How incumbent does this White House believe it is upon Congress to come up with a solution to the DREAMers issue?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're in the process of finalizing the decision on this front. And once we make that, we'll walk through next steps of what any action that would be needed at that time.\nQ: I asked that -- if I could just follow up -- I asked that question because Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina is introducing a conservative Dream Act. He is leading a group of conservatives in the Senate. Senator Jeff Flake says that it's important for Congress to do this. Paul Ryan, while he said he doesn't agree that the President should end DACA as we know it, does think there needs to be a legislative solution. Does the White House agree with what's being said from Capitol Hill?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'll say it for a third or fourth time, and I'm sure I'll get another five or six more questions on this and I'll get to say it another five or six more times: We're in the process of finalizing that decision and those details, and we'll announce that on Tuesday.\nQ: Sarah, the President said \"we love DREAMers\" today, and, in April, he said the DREAMers should \"rest easy.\" You know the President. Is it conceivable that he could end this program and send all these people out of the country after saying things like that?\nMS. SANDERS: I knew I'd get another chance to say this. We're finalizing those details, and we --\nQ: That's not a detail, that's whether he ends the program.\nMS. SANDERS: -- and we're finalizing this decision. It is part of the answer -- is that we're finalizing this decision and that would certainly be part of --\nQ: But he must have made that fundamental decision.\nMS. SANDERS: -- the details of the announcement on Tuesday.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. The President has said that if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall. Is he backing down from that threat now?\nMS. SANDERS: No, the President is still very much committed to building the wall.\nQ: So there's a report out, though, in the Washington Post that basically says he's -- you have a smile there on your face -- that he's backing away from this. (Laughter.)\nMS. SANDERS: Well, you know how I feel about using other outlets as your source.\nQ: Well, is it wrong then?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has been pretty clear what his position is. I would take that as the President's position over a report on what it is.\nJess.\nQ: Sarah, if I can ask you two questions, one about the ROK call that happened today: Yonhap already has a readout of the conversation and, in it, the South Koreans are saying that the President of the United States promised more missile capabilities to Seoul. Can you confirm that? And do you have any sense of what we're talking about there?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we'll have a readout out shortly, and we'll certainly make sure all of you guys receive that.\nSara.\nQ: I have a question on NAFTA as well. The talks are going on now. Obviously, the President has made his feelings pretty clear, but he's also talked several times about terminating the deal. Is that on the table as these talks go forward?\nMS. SANDERS: Those negotiations are still ongoing, and no decision has been made at this time.\nSara.\nQ: Shifting back onto Hurricane Harvey: Has the President made a decision on what charities he's going to donate to? Do you know if that's going to be coming from his own money or from the Trump Foundation?\nMS. SANDERS: He has not finalized where all of that will go, and I was actually going to use that as a perfect segue to remind everybody, if you have suggestions, he is very open to hearing those. We've gotten a couple, but please send more if you have them.\nJohn Gizzi. Oh, sorry.\nQ: But can you clarify whether it's going to be his personal money or money from the Trump Foundation?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a chance to do that, but I will.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Yesterday, Sheriff Dave Clarke of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced his resignation effective immediately. This started a rush of speculation in the Badger State and in Washington that he would be appointed to a position at the Department of Homeland Security, possibly even the secretaryship, which is vacant. Now a lady at DHS said he's not coming here, to reporters. Is former Sheriff Clarke under consideration for any position, particularly at the Department of Homeland Security?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any specific jobs that he's being considered for, but, as always, we'll certainly make sure when we have a personnel announcement we'll let you know.\nAlex.\nQ: A poll released by Fox News on Wednesday said that 56 percent of Americans think the President is tearing the country apart, and approval rating polls are usually in the 30s. How do these poll numbers affect how the President governs?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that a lot of these polls are a lot of the same polls that predicted that Donald Trump would never be the President, and he's sitting in the Oval Office as I stand here. So I don't have a lot of faith in a lot of these polls.\nI think if you look at what he's been doing this week, particularly in terms of focusing on unifying the nation on Hurricane Harvey recovery, talking about tax reform -- an issue that's got very wide bipartisan support -- the numbers, frankly, that we are focused on and that this administration cares about aren't polls numbers. But we care about 94 percent of Americans who get assistance to file their taxes, that the majority of Americans thinks the tax code is unfair, and that 70 percent of individuals in 10 key states support broad-based tax reform.\nThe numbers that we're focused on have to do with actual problems that Americans are facing. The numbers that we're focused on are the ones that actually impact day-to-day life for all Americans. That's what we're focused on; certainly not silly polls that, frankly, weren't much use to us in the election, and, certainly, I don't think are now.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I want to switch to tax reform. We learned today that the President will be traveling to North Dakota next week. This week he was in Missouri. Republicans hold 52 seats in the Senate, and the Democratic senators from those states are ones that the White House is targeting. If the White House got those votes that would put you up to 54. Joe Donnelly and Joe Manchin are two other Democratic senators that the White House is looking to pick up. That would be 56. Where are the other four democratic votes that the White House and the President think they can get for tax reform?\nMS. SANDERS: I would love to see all of them come on board. I can't imagine why anybody wouldn't want to support helping more Americans keep more of their hard-earned money. We want to simplify the tax-filing process for individuals, encourage job creation, encourage job growth, provide tax relief for middle-class America, and encourage companies to bring back money to the United States and invest it. I don't know why any member of the Senate or the House wouldn't want to support those things, and hopefully they'll all come on board.\nQ: So you don't have four other states that you might be traveling to or four other names specifically?\nMS. SANDERS: Not specifically. Again, I'm hoping that the senators from all 50 states get on board to help Americans and do what, frankly, Americans are demanding.\nI think you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody that doesn't support tax reform in this country, and those are the people that are the bosses of those individuals. Those are the people that elected those members to go there and help do the things that they are asking for, and tax reform is at the top of their list.\nQ: Sarah, my paper just published a story that Robert Mueller has obtained a copy of the letter drafted by President Trump and written, in part, by Stephen Miller and other aides around the time of the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey that enumerates a rationale for having him removed that focuses principally on the Russia investigation.\nA couple of quick questions. First of all, can you confirm the existence of that letter? Secondly, can that letter be made public? And thirdly, we report that Don McGahn thought it was inappropriate. Can you discuss whether or not you or the President believe that drafting a statement was appropriate at that time?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into any of that. I think we covered a lot of those things very extensively during that time. As Ty Cobb said earlier today, to the extent the special prosecutor is interested in these matters, we will be fully transparent with his investigation. And frankly, I don't have anything to add beyond that.\nQ: Can we get a copy of the letter?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're going to work with the special prosecutor, as Ty said, and we'll work through that process.\nNoah.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. (Crosstalk.)\nMS. SANDERS: Hey, guys -- one at a time. I'll come back to you after that.\nQ: Earlier this week, the President tweeted that \"talking is not the answer\" in regards to the North Koreans. Today the South Korean President's office says he and President Moon agreed to reaffirm that North Korea should be brought back for dialogue. So which is it on that --\nMS. SANDERS: I think I was clear on this yesterday. The President is looking for an integrated process and we're continuing to move forward on that. We take North Korea extremely seriously and all options are on the table. That hasn't changed.\nNoah.\nQ: This is a follow-up to the NAFTA question. Mexico has threatened to end the negotiations that are going on if the President initiates steps to pull out of NAFTA. Would the President view that as a positive outcome? And is there any concern overall in the White House that the escalation of the rhetoric will hurt the White House's ability to craft a better deal, as the President has promised?\nMS. SANDERS: No, we're continuing to move forward in these negotiations. And as the President says, we'll see what happens.\nApril.\nQ: On the issue of DACA, the Vice President said that the President will use a big heart in making this decision. What is the definition of a big heart?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth on this until there's a finalized decision, which we're in the process of doing. And we'll make that announcement on Tuesday.\nQ: I have one more on jobs. What is this White House saying about jobs, particularly as the unemployment rate is at 4.4 percent but you have a continuation, historically, of African-American and Latino rates that are higher? For August, the African-American unemployment rate, 7.7 percent; the Latino rate, 5.2 percent; the white rate, 3.9 percent.\nA few weeks ago, Stephen Miller was at this podium talking about the black unemployment rate versus that of the immigrants. Is there going to be a targeted approach? I mean, these numbers bear to show that there is a difference when it comes to minority American unemployment versus mainstream America.\nMS. SANDERS: I think you make a great point for why we need tax reform. It's one of the primary reasons that that's a top priority for this administration is to do a massive overhaul of the system so that we have a better environment, we're creating more jobs, higher paying jobs, and I think that's a perfect example.\nThere were 150,000 new jobs created over this time period, and since the President came into office, 1.2 million new jobs. We are incredibly focused on this. This is not just something we have been talking about, but something that the President has been very active in since day one.\nHe has gotten rid of over 800 regulations that have created a better environment for job creation. We're continuing to focus on that, primarily through tax reform. And, that's why it's such a big deal for us in the fall.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks. Can you confirm that the President is meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday about tax reform? And, does that mean that the details are almost finished?\nMS. SANDERS: He is meeting with congressional leaders next week and --\nQ: On Tuesday?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe it's Tuesday. Yeah, I believe that's right. And I believe there's a second meeting on Wednesday, as well.\nQ: Does that mean the package is almost finished?\nMS. SANDERS: That means that we're pushing forward. We're going to continue -- again, focused on those four principles, using that as the guide and the focal point moving forward -- and sit down with a lot of members of Congress to make sure we get this deal done.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions. The first one is on DACA. I know you're not ready to make an announcement yet, but these people, these DREAMers came out of the shadows and they provided their personal information to the government for work permits. If the President does end DACA, will that information be used to round up and deport any of these people? That's my first question.\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I'll answer it the same way I have answered it 18 other times today. Those decisions are being finalized and once they are, we will announce them on Tuesday.\nQ: My second question is on infrastructure. Clearly, the devastation in Texas brings attention to problems with our infrastructure, and there's going to be a need for massive rebuilding. I know tax reform is the focus right now but will there be a push for an infrastructure bill either after that or around the same time? And will that be coming from the White House or will the administration be letting Congress take the lead on infrastructure?\nMS. SANDERS: Infrastructure is certainly something that's very important to the President, a priority for the administration. The timing of that hasn't been set forth yet but it's certainly something we're actively working on and looking at every day. As we like to say here, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, and we'll continue to push forward on how to best improve the infrastructure.\nQ: Hurricane Harvey -- the President was in Texas on Tuesday, he's going back tomorrow. I understand the exact schedule might not yet be set but can you give us any kind of idea of what kinds of things he's going to be doing and what, thematically -- what he's going to be doing this weekend that he didn't have a chance to do on Tuesday?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. He'll be able to go into Houston, which he was not able to do on Tuesday. That will be the first stop of the day. He'll have the chance to meet extensively with quite a few storm survivors, as well as talk with some of the volunteers that are helping administer a lot of the support that these individuals have needed over the last week.\nAnd then from there, he'll go to Lake Charles, Louisiana, where he'll do a stop there as well, meeting with a lot of the volunteers and other storm survivors.\nQ: Are there any events on Sunday? Or is this all contained to Saturday?\nMS. SANDERS: All on Saturday.\nQ: Does he have any other weekend plans after that?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll keep you posted on further guidance for the weekend.\nHallie.\nQ: If I can ask two questions on that. Given the President is going to be obviously pretty busy on Saturday, down in that region -- you've said 19 times that he's going to be finalizing the decision in the next three days. Can you specifically explain what is going to change between now and Tuesday, given that we heard the President talk in the Oval Office about a decision coming this weekend? What specifically is he doing in these next three days that he hasn't done so far?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that this is a pretty complicated process, as you all know, and we want to work through every bit of that. And that's what he's doing. He's making sure he takes the diligent time and effort and attention that this very important issue deserves.\nQ: And given that it's so important, I just want to kind of personalize a little. There's a guy in Texas right now, Jesus Contreras (ph). He's a paramedic. He's been working since the storm hit to help people in the community, in and around Texas. He also happens to be a DREAMer. What's the President's message to Jesus?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's the same message that he's said many times before. This President is a President that loves people, and we are working on the best decision possible. And we'll announce it on Tuesday.\nCharlie.\nQ: New reports are detailing how the, under the Obama administration, the group Antifa was being watched and their activities were declared as \"domestic terrorist violence.\" My question is: Was the President or his Chief of Staff aware of those investigations and reports before Charlottesville?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'd have to ask, and I haven't had the conversation, Charlie.\nQ: Is he tracking the rise of violence from this group going forward?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, is he what?\nQ: Is he tracking the rise of violence from these groups going forward?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we're certainly constantly monitoring all violence across the country as best we can, and something certainly that the Department of Homeland Security and the administration takes very seriously and is constantly looking for ways to end all violence in all forms. So certainly that would qualify.\nQ: A follow-up to Hallie's question for a moment. I think I read that there were 120,000 DREAMers in the state of Texas. Is that in any way weighing on the President's decision about DACA and what the situation there is?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think that this isn't a decision that the President takes lightly, and he's taking time and diligent effort to make sure that he goes through every bit of the process. And he'll continue to do that and make that announcement on Tuesday.\nQ: Is what's happening in Texas and even Louisiana weighing on him at all?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the decision itself is weighing on him, certainly.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I've got two. The first one is, coming back after Labor Day Weekend, there's obviously a lot of stuff on the agenda.\nMS. SANDERS: It's going to be a busy September.\nQ: There were some tensions between the President and congressional Republicans over the summer, and I'm just wondering if he has a message for them that you would want to share about any reset that he hopes to effect in the next four days before he comes back?\nAnd I also wanted to ask you -- with all the caveats that you're loath to discuss -- this letter that -- this part of an investigation --\nMS. SANDERS: Let me answer the first question so we don't get lost in that. I think that the message that the President would have for the members of Congress would be: Let's get to work. You've had a nice long break here, and we've got a lot of things to do. We've got some big commitments to the American people that we need to fulfill, and we need to do some really big and bold things throughout the fall. And hopefully, they'll get on board and be part of that process.\nQ: The letter, as reported, suggests that some of the rationale did have to do with Russia. But the President initially talked about Hillary Clinton, and I'm wondering whether you can square those two for us? Do you think his message -- do you think there's now an inconsistency that needs to be addressed? And would you like to address it from the podium?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure I'm following fully your question. But as I said earlier in reference to the letter and the Comey firing, we have discussed that extensively. In fact, I've done that many times from this podium. And I'll refer you back to Ty Cobb's statement that I read earlier. There's nothing more to add on that.\nQ: Sarah, can I drill down on what is driving the DACA review and final decision? Is the President reviewing the merits of the DACA policy? Or is he reviewing the legality and validity of the process the Obama administration used to grant it? In other words, if Congress were to move to protect the DREAMers, would he be in support of that? Would he sign on to such an effort? There does seem to be interest there. What is he reviewing?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but since you guys are, then I guess I have no choice to be. But we're continuing to work through this decision process and I'm not going to go any further than that. The President has made a lot of statements on this, and he's going through all of the details of this very thoroughly. And once a final decision is made and those details are ironed out, we'll let you guys know on Tuesday.\nJust as we're wrapping up here, a reminder: If you have suggestions for the President to contribute to that would be great if you could get those to us by the end of the day.\nAnd also we encourage everybody to participate in the National Day of Prayer and hope you have a good Labor Day Weekend.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 3:50 P.M.

I appreciate it.\nAnd it's really -- David, seeing something like what has happened here -- you know, David has taken the Veterans Administration -- the VA -- and he has done so many things for the veterans and such. We've really been here eight months, if you think about it. (Applause.) And they now have choice, which is such a big thing.\nYou know, you used to read -- and for those of you that aren't vets, frankly -- and we have a lot of vets in the room, I know, but you used to wait in line for nine days, fourteen days. Ted knows very well. And now, Ted, as you know, he has a program of choice where they don't have to do that. They go to a doctor and we take care of it. But it's faster.\nIt's actually -- probably, in the end, it will be less expensive, if you think about it. And people that can be fixed up perfectly in a matter of minutes -- I mean, in some cases, bad, bad things happen to them because they couldn't get to see a doctor. Now they see their doctor. They see a doctor of their choice. But they go out and they get great medical care quickly, Governor. It's the way you would do it, I know that. (Applause.)\nAnd really, for years, as a civilian -- I don't know if I've ever said this -- I used to sit back and say, I wonder why they don't do this. It's not like so complicated, right? I'd read these horrible stories about our great people, our great veterans standing on a line and waiting for weeks to get to just see a doctor. And they have some great doctors in the VA, some really talented doctors --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- the problem is, you just can't -- oh, somebody said thank you. Sounds like -- are you a doctor in the VA or do you see what we're doing? Thank you and I appreciate that. So we're doing it, and we're really proud of it.\nAnd, Ben, you are doing a spectacular job -- really spectacular -- with HUD, and brought a lot of spirit. (Applause.) Ben has brought a lot of spirit to HUD, I can tell you that. I know it very well.\nAnd Betsy, again, thank you very much. Thank you everybody.\nAnd Governor, congratulations on doing a real job. And I'll give you another congratulations in about one week because that will be that other.\nAnd then it's a long-term. I mean, we're talking about -- they say two years, three years. I think that, you know, because this is Texas, you'll probably do it in six months, I have a feeling, right? (Applause.) Now I think for a lot of places, maybe it never gets done, right? I think in your case, it'll get done very quickly.\nThank you everybody. Again, National Prayer Day tomorrow. And a real honor to be with you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ted. Thank you, Brock. Thank you. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-09-02", "title": "Remarks During a Visit to a Relief Center for Individuals Impacted by Hurricane Harvey in Pearland, Texas"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127974", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ)\nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3354, making appropriations for the interior and environment, agriculture and rural development, commerce, justice, science, financial services and general government, homeland security, labor, health and human services, education, state and foreign operations, and transportation, housing and urban development for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes.\nThe Administration also appreciates the Committee's commitment to incorporate the text of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, which is a strong step toward fulfilling the President's promise to put the safety of the American people first. As noted in a supportive Statement of Administration Policy issued on July 24, 2017, H.R. 3219 provides critical funding to rebuild our military and includes the President's $1.6 billion border wall proposal.\nIf H.R. 3354 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.\nThe Administration strongly supports the House of Representatives' efforts to protect the right to life, cut down on needless and overly burdensome regulations, and strengthen border and immigration enforcement. The Administration also appreciates the House of Representatives' work to rebuild our military and restrain overall non-defense discretionary spending, but notes that current spending levels as reflected in H.R. 3354 and H.R. 3219 would result in a sequestration of $72.4 billion in the defense category. To help avoid a sequestration, the Administration urges both the House and Senate to enact the $57.3 billion in savings included in the Major Savings and Reforms volume of the FY 2018 Budget request while also making the necessary changes to the discretionary caps.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDivision A - Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of the Interior (DOI)\nFederal Land Acquisition. The Administration objects to the increase in funding provided by the bill for land acquisition, which is $50 million above the FY 2018 Budget request. The Department currently manages roughly 500 million acres and has a deferred infrastructure maintenance backlog of approximately $15 billion. Limited resources should be focused on ongoing operations and maintenance.\nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service\nWildland Fire Funding. The Administration appreciates the bill's investment in wildland fire operations at $3.4 billion as requested in the FY 2018 Budget, including fully funding suppression at the 10-year average for both the Forest Service and DOI. The Administration also appreciates the Committee's acceptance of the FY 2018 Budget proposal to move funding for the first eight hours of work per day out of fire suppression and into preparedness. The \"base 8\" shift moves the Forest Service to a more accurate and accountable budget approach that is consistent with DOI, with salaries for all firefighters planned for in full.\nUSDA\nForest Service Land Acquisition. The Administration objects to the increase in funding provided in the bill to increase land acquisition by $18 million over the FY 2018 Budget request. The Forest Service currently manages 193 million acres, has a deferred infrastructure maintenance backlog of over $5 billion, and would be better served if its scarce resources were focused on improved management of existing assets and lands.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nState Revolving Funds (SRFs). While the Administration appreciates the attention paid to critical water infrastructure needs through the funding provided to the Water Infrastructure and Finance Innovation Act credit program, the Administration is disappointed in the reduction to the Clean Water SRF. Infrastructure investment is a priority for the Administration and the bill level of $1.1 billion for the SRF, which is $250 million lower than the FY 2018 Budget request, would result in less funding going to States to finance critical wastewater and storm water infrastructure investments.\nOther Independent Agencies\nSmithsonian Institution (Institution). The Administration urges the Congress to fund the Smithsonian Facilities Capital account at the $228 million requested in the FY 2018 Budget. The National Air and Space Museum (NASM) is in critical need of repair, and funding the NASM project within the level provided by the bill would force the Institution to divert funding from its Facilities Capital budget, leaving the Institution with insufficient funding for the many other important safety, security, and critical infrastructure projects planned for FY 2018.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, sections 403, 409, and other provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress.\nDivision B - Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nRural Economic Infrastructure Grant Program. The Administration welcomes the Committee's support for rural America through the establishment of the Rural Economic Infrastructure Grant Program, for which the bill provides $123 million, with a $60 million set-aside for projects in Appalachia.\nRural Broadband Loan Program. The Administration welcomes the bill's support of high-speed internet in rural America through the $27 million in loans made available under the Rural Broadband Loan Program.\nFood Safety. The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the FY 2018 Budget request for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which would help ensure that all meat, poultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled.\nCredit for Farmers. The Administration welcomes the Committee's support for farmers through the bill's $7 billion for Farm Service Agency direct and guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans.\nRural Development Programs. The Administration is concerned that the bill misses an opportunity to reduce duplicative spending by funding Rural Business-Cooperative Service programs, the direct loan and grant program for water and wastewater, as well as single family housing direct loans. The Small Business Administration's loan program, EPA's State Revolving Funds, Federal housing loan guarantees, and the private sector can effectively meet the demands for these programs.\nMcGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program (McGovern-Dole). The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $202 million in funding for McGovern-Dole, which the FY 2018 Budget proposes for elimination. McGovern-Dole is duplicative of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs, is being ineffectively implemented, and has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges.\nP.L. 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II). The Administration opposes providing food aid funding through use of Title II and prefers that all food aid be provided through the International Disaster Assistance account in USAID. While the United States is the world's largest donor of food aid, taxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible. Unfortunately, Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits the ability of USAID to use the most appropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, section 716 would violate the Recommendation Clause; sections 702, 706, 717, 727, and other provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress; and section 719 would interfere with the President's Take Care authority to supervise the Executive Branch.\nDivision C - Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of Commerce\nCensus Bureau. The Administration appreciates the bill's strong support of the 2020 Decennial Census and other periodic programs. The Administration continues to assess the progress of planning and preparing for a modern and improved 2020 Census and looks forward to working closely with the Congress in order to deliver an accurate and on-time decennial census while efficiently using taxpayer resources.\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Follow On (PFO) Program. The Administration is concerned that the bill only provides $50 million of the $180 million requested for NOAA's PFO weather satellite. Insufficient funding for this program could increase both the cost of procurement in future years and the risk that critical weather forecasting data would be unavailable after the current generation of satellites reach the end of their operational lives.\nNOAA Fisheries Disaster Assistance. The Administration opposes the bill's $20 million in unrequested funds for commercial fisheries that received disaster declarations in FY 2017. Businesses affected by these fishery disasters have access to assistance through other Government programs, such as the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ)\nImmigration Judge Teams (IJ Teams). The Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for the Executive Office for Immigration Review to hire an additional 65 IJ Teams that would support efforts to efficiently and effectively adjudicate cases, including reducing the current case backlog.\nState and Local Grants. The Administration appreciates the overall support provided by the bill to DOJ's State and local law enforcement assistance grants. The Administration urges the Congress, however, to restore stand-alone funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Program, currently provided for under the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program, and eliminate funding for the unrequested and unauthorized State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.\nState and Local Information Sharing. The Administration has previously stated its support for H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and urges the Congress to also include section 219 of the FY 2018 Budget request in the appropriations bill. The amendments proposed by section 219 would prevent State and local government officials from prohibiting or restricting any law enforcement entity or official from complying with a lawful civil immigration detainer request, and would authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOJ to make Federal grant awards subject to State and local cooperation with immigration enforcement activities and requests.\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nOverall NASA Funding. The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for NASA. Extending the Nation's leadership in space is important and the NASA programs funded by this bill would help the Nation meet future challenges.\nScience. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NASA Science, but is concerned that funding additional flagship missions in FY 2018 would place significant pressure on the Science budget in future years as these missions ramp up and compete with other priorities. The FY 2018 Budget request for NASA Science reflects a balanced portfolio that is consistent with direction from the Decadal Survey for each discipline.\nNational Space Council (NSpC)\nNSpC Funding. The Administration has revived the National Space Council, which is tasked with advising and assisting the President regarding national space policy and strategy. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to provide funding for the Space Council as a separate office within the Executive Office of the President.\nNational Science Foundation (NSF)\nNSF Funding. The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $7.3 billion for NSF, which is $687 million above the FY 2018 Budget request. The request focuses funding on NSF's core research programs and undoes some of the large increases to programs that occurred during the previous administration.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, sections 518 and 529 would intrude upon the President's constitutional authority to negotiate international agreements and conduct international diplomacy.\nDivision D - Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of the Treasury\nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) Funding. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for TFI. The Department of the Treasury programs that freeze the accounts of terrorists and proliferators, implement sanctions on rogue nations, and link law enforcement agencies with financial institutions are critical to the continued safety and financial stability of the Nation. Further, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure support for the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), a key outcome from the President's summit in Saudi Arabia. The TFTC would enhance cooperation with Gulf countries in the fight against terrorism, and counter Iran's malign influence.\nGeneral Services Administration (GSA)\nOverall GSA Funding. The FY 2018 Budget request for GSA includes a number of new funding mechanisms to facilitate Government streamlining and modernization. The Administration urges the Congress to support these initiatives, which either have been recently authorized by the Congress or are being actively pursued legislatively.\nTechnology Modernization Fund (TMF). The bill does not include $228 million requested for the TMF to retire and replace antiquated legacy information technology (IT) systems. The TMF is an important step in changing the way the Federal Government manages its IT portfolio by establishing a central mechanism designed to improve management and oversight with resources dedicated to IT modernization, moving agencies to more secure and efficient IT systems, and infrastructure. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide the necessary funding for the TMF as the authorizing legislation moves forward.\nFederal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC). The bill does not include $9 million for FPISC to execute its statutory mission outlined under Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. Ensuring that the Federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects is coordinated, predictable, and transparent is a top priority of the Administration.\nAsset Management and Space Proceeds Fund (AMSPF). The Administration appreciates that the Committee has provided resources to stand up the Public Buildings Reform Board authorized under the Federal Asset Sales and Transfer Act. The Administration, however, urges the Congress to fund the AMSPF at the requested level of $40 million, which would help carry out the recommendations of the Board to dispose of unneeded Federal property and improve efficiency.\nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF) Capital Program. The Administration objects to the diversion of more than $2 billion in FBF rent proceeds from investment in the capital program. The bill eliminates all funding for the construction and major renovation programs, and significantly underfunds both the minor repair and maintenance and special emphasis programs.\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM)\nOPM IT Modernization. The Administration welcomes the $18 million in funding provided in the bill to fund important IT modernization improvements at OPM. At the same time, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the $37 million included in the FY 2018 Budget request for this purpose. It is vital that OPM has the resources necessary to fund modernization of its IT systems, including its financial and retirement servicing systems. These resources are necessary to defend against increasingly advanced cyber threats. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure OPM is capable of meeting these needs.\nOther\nFinancial Regulatory Reform. The Administration commends the Committee for moving financial reform legislation through the Congress. The Administration is committed to reforming the Nation's financial system, as demonstrated by Executive Order 13772, Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System, and the Department of the Treasury's ensuing review. The bill reflects the Administration's Core Principles in several key respects. In particular, the bill would provide regulatory relief to community financial institutions and rein in the unchecked authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, the Administration is concerned with section 632 of the bill, which would impede the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to investigate and uncover securities fraud by inhibiting its access to the content of electronic communications from internet service providers. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact legislation that supports the Core Principles.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, sections 101, 118, 119, 122, 123, 201, 302, 511, 520, 608, 609, 717, 729, 738, 803, 815, and other provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress; and provisions in title II under the heading \"Office of Management and Budget—Salaries and Expenses\" would interfere with the President's constitutional authority to supervise and direct the Executive Branch.\nDivision E - Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018\nBorder Wall. The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's support for the fully funded border wall proposal, which is a critical element of the Administration's strategy to secure the borders. Physical barriers are vital for border security because they deter, prevent, and deny potential illegal border crossings for illegal alien movement generally, and for human smuggling and drug smuggling specifically. The $1.6 billion provided by H.R. 3219, which is expected to be incorporated into the bill, is for physical barrier construction along the southwest border in the areas with the highest current risk and the greatest current operational need, including $784 million for 32 miles of new border fencing in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas, $498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall in RGV, and $251 million for 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego, California.\nStrengthening Immigration Enforcement. The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's support for the FY 2018 Budget request to strengthen immigration enforcement, including by hiring immigration law enforcement officers and agents and by increasing immigration detention capacity. Additional resources for these efforts would help to ensure increased border security, the apprehension, detention, and removal of dangerous aliens from the Nation's streets, and the disruption and dismantling of human smuggling and trafficking activities conducted by transnational criminal organizations.\nState and Local Information Sharing. The Administration has previously stated its support for H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and urges the Congress to also include section 523 of the FY 2018 Budget request in the appropriations bill. The amendments proposed by section 523 would prevent State and local government officials from prohibiting or restricting any law enforcement entity or official from complying with a lawful civil immigration detainer request, and would authorize DHS and DOJ to make Federal grant awards subject to State and local cooperation with immigration enforcement activities and requests. The Administration is committed to strengthening enforcement of the Nation's immigration laws in order to improve national security and public safety. This proposal is critical to these efforts.\nStatute of Limitations for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance Recoveries. The Administration objects to section 540 of the bill, which changes the three-year statute of limitations for recovery of FEMA disaster assistance grants provided to State or local governments. Section 540 of the bill would amend the recovery action timeline to begin when an individual project is completed, instead of when a recipient (or sub-recipient) has completed all work for a disaster or emergency. The Administration understands that State and local recovery efforts are important; but it is also important for FEMA to have adequate time to properly review recovery expenditures and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately.\nU.S. Secret Service Staffing. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Secret Service hiring. The bill fully supports the FY 2018 Budget request to increase Secret Service staffing by over 300 agents, officers, and professional staff, which would enable the agency to address chronic staffing shortfalls and reach a sustainable staffing level.\nConstitutional Concerns\nSection 509 of the bill raises separation of powers concerns because it purports to condition the use of appropriated funds upon approval by committees of the Congress.\nDivision F - Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of Labor\nApprenticeship. The Administration strongly opposes the elimination of funding for apprenticeship grants. Apprenticeships equip workers with the skills needed to compete and allow workers to earn while they learn. Terminating the apprenticeships initiative would hinder efforts to allow more workers and employers to benefit from this proven model that closes the skills gap.\nOffice of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). The bill does not provide OLMS with the resources necessary to protect union members from corruption. The previous administration allowed employment in OLMS to fall by one-third, severely impeding the Agency's ability to investigate and prosecute financial misconduct in labor organizations. The Administration believes the $47 million requested in the FY 2018 Budget would provide better protection for America's workers.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\nIndirect Cost Restriction. The Administration is disappointed by language included in section 228 of the bill, which prohibits changes to the method the National Institutes of Health (NIH) uses to pay grantee institutions for administrative and facilities costs. Further, the Administration is strongly opposed to any attempts to prohibit NIH or any other Agency staff from developing strategies to make Government programs more effective and efficient.\nDepartment of Education\nTitle I and Public School Choice Grants. The Administration opposes the omission of increased funding for Title I, which would provide supplemental awards to school districts that decide to provide more educational options to students. This would allow students to benefit from Federal, State, and local funds to attend the public school of their choice. The FY 2018 Budget request includes $1 billion to support a public school choice proposal for all students and give disadvantaged students from low-income areas the opportunity to attend a quality K-12 school.\nEducation, Innovation and Research (EIR) and School Choice. The Administration opposes the lack of funding for the EIR program, including the $250 million requested to expand and evaluate the effectiveness and opportunities provided through private school choice programs across the Nation. EIR supports the expansion of innovative and proven approaches to improve America's education system, address persistent challenges in education, and build institutional knowledge of what is working.\nSupporting Effective Instruction State Grants. The Administration supports the elimination of Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants, as proposed in the FY 2018 Budget request and as reflected in the bill. These grants are poorly targeted and funds are spread too thinly to have a meaningful impact on student outcomes. There are better ways to use funding to effectively assist students and to support those who need it most.\nSocial Security Administration (SSA)\nSSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses. The Administration supports the funding level provided for SSA's administrative budget. The bill funds dedicated program integrity activities at $1.7 billion, including funding the fully authorized cap adjustment level of $1.5 billion. Program integrity activities are crucial to ensuring only eligible individuals receive social security benefits.\nOther Independent Agencies\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The Administration opposes funding of the IMLS. The bill provides $231 million for IMLS, whereas the FY 2018 Budget requested $23 million to close down IMLS. IMLS's funding supplements State, local, and private funds, which provide the vast majority of funding to museums and libraries. In addition, authorization of appropriations for this Agency expired in FY 2016.\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The Administration objects to the FY 2020 funding level provided for CPB through the two-year advance appropriation. The FY 2018 Budget request proposes eliminating Federal funding for CPB by FY 2019 and proposes rescinding all but $30 million of the FY 2018 appropriation. CPB grants represent a small share of the total funding for the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio and the Administration believes private donations would be sufficient to fund these operations.\nDivision G - Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of State and Other International Programs\nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The Administration commends the Committee for supporting the proposal in the FY 2018 Budget to begin reining in the excessive expansion of OCO for the Department of State and USAID (State/USAID), and would oppose an OCO funding level higher than $12 billion. OCO funding for State/USAID began as a tool to provide for the temporary and extraordinary costs related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but has been distorted to serve as a back-door means of circumventing the cap on non-defense discretionary spending.\nDepartment of the Treasury Contributions to Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). The Administration strongly opposes the over $600 million reduction to the FY 2018 Budget request for the Department's contributions to the MDBs. The decreases in the bill to the World Bank's International Development Association and the African Development Fund are particularly problematic, as the requested funding level would support development in some of the world's poorest countries by leveraging funding from other donors. This major reduction would upset the delicate balance needed to maintain United States leadership at these institutions while ensuring that other donors pay their fair share.\nEliminations and Reductions. The Administration appreciates that the Committee adopted some of the reductions proposed in the FY 2018 Budget, including eliminating funding for the East-West Center, the International Organizations and Programs, and the Complex Crises Fund accounts, and for contributions to the Green Climate Fund and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. Furthermore, funding could be restored for Treasury International Programs by supporting the other eliminations and reductions requested in the FY 2018 Budget. The programs proposed for termination are not critical to the conduct of United States foreign policy and often duplicate the efforts of other Federal programs or the non-profit and private sectors.\nForeign Military Financing (FMF). The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports FMF programs including assistance to Israel, but is concerned that the bill does not provide the requested authority to provide FMF loans. FMF loans offer the opportunity to further support the United States industrial base while promoting burden sharing via direct loans rather than grants to foreign partners.\nExport-Import Bank (Bank) Board Quorum Waiver.The Administration opposes the inclusion of language that would effectively waive the requirement that the Export-Import Bank have at least three board members to constitute a quorum. The Administration urges the Congress to act on the Administration's pending nominees to the Bank's Board of Directors and restore the Bank's full operating authority, rather than circumvent the confirmation process.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, a proviso in title I under the heading \"Department of State—International Organizations—Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities\" would infringe upon the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief and over the conduct of diplomacy; although the Administration shares the policy views in section 7070, that provision would interfere with the President's authority to recognize foreign governments and conduct diplomacy; and numerous provisions, including provisions in sections 7013, 7025, 7029, 7031, 7037, 7041, 7042, 7043, and 7071 would infringe upon the President's authority to conduct diplomacy and receive foreign diplomats.\nDivision H - Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT)\nInfrastructure Investment. The FY 2018 Budget supports a new vision for infrastructure investment in the Nation with a focused role for the Federal Government—streamlining burdensome approval processes and incentivizing more investment by rewarding States and localities that support infrastructure projects and maintain them over the long term. The bill, however, includes unrequested funding for Capital Investment Grants, Essential Air Service, and Amtrak contrary to reforms proposed in the FY 2018 Budget. These reforms would respectively, limit funding for local transit projects that should be funded by States and localities that benefit from their use, eliminate discretionary funding and focus on remote airports that are most in need of subsidized commercial air service, and terminate Federal support for long-distance train services that serve a small percentage of the population and generate significant operating losses.\nTIGER Grants. The Administration appreciates that the bill supports the FY 2018 Budget request to eliminate funding for TIGER Grants, given that Federal funding should not be directed to projects with localized benefits that often do not rise to the level of national or regional significance.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nRental Assistance. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of HUD rental assistance to low-income families. However, the bill funds rental assistance programs at $38.5 billion, which is $3.3 billion above the FY 2018 Budget request, ignoring reforms to put rental assistance on a more sustainable fiscal path while also continuing to assist current residents, encouraging work, and promoting self-sufficiency.\nHUD IT. The Administration is concerned that HUD would be unable to maintain IT current services or invest in needed IT improvements, as the bill provides $150 million for IT—$100 million below the FY 2018 Budget request.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, sections 221, 230, 287, 406 would raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2017-09-05", "title": "H.R. 3354 - Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128181", "text": "As President, my highest duty is to defend the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America. At the same time, I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.\nThe legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws – this is the bedrock of our Constitutional system, which I took a solemn oath to preserve, protect, and defend.\nIn June of 2012, President Obama bypassed Congress to give work permits, social security numbers, and federal benefits to approximately 800,000 illegal immigrants currently between the ages of 15 and 36. The typical recipients of this executive amnesty, known as DACA, are in their twenties. Legislation offering these same benefits had been introduced in Congress on numerous occasions and rejected each time.\nIn referencing the idea of creating new immigration rules unilaterally, President Obama admitted that \"I can't just do these things by myself\" – and yet that is exactly what he did, making an end-run around Congress and violating the core tenets that sustain our Republic.\nOfficials from 10 States are suing over the program, requiring my Administration to make a decision regarding its legality. The Attorney General of the United States, the Attorneys General of many states, and virtually all other top legal experts have advised that the program is unlawful and unconstitutional and cannot be successfully defended in court.\nThere can be no path to principled immigration reform if the executive branch is able to rewrite or nullify federal laws at will.\nThe temporary implementation of DACA by the Obama Administration, after Congress repeatedly rejected this amnesty-first approach, also helped spur a humanitarian crisis – the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America including, in some cases, young people who would become members of violent gangs throughout our country, such as MS-13.\nOnly by the reliable enforcement of immigration law can we produce safe communities, a robust middle class, and economic fairness for all Americans.\nTherefore, in the best interests of our country, and in keeping with the obligations of my office, the Department of Homeland Security will begin an orderly transition and wind-down of DACA, one that provides minimum disruption. While new applications for work permits will not be accepted, all existing work permits will be honored until their date of expiration up to two full years from today. Furthermore, applications already in the pipeline will be processed, as will renewal applications for those facing near-term expiration. This is a gradual process, not a sudden phase out. Permits will not begin to expire for another six months, and will remain active for up to 24 months. Thus, in effect, I am not going to just cut DACA off, but rather provide a window of opportunity for Congress to finally act.\nOur enforcement priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on criminals, security threats, recent border-crossers, visa overstays, and repeat violators. I have advised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.\nThe decades-long failure of Washington, D.C. to enforce federal immigration law has had both predictable and tragic consequences: lower wages and higher unemployment for American workers, substantial burdens on local schools and hospitals, the illicit entry of dangerous drugs and criminal cartels, and many billions of dollars a year in costs paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Yet few in Washington expressed any compassion for the millions of Americans victimized by this unfair system. Before we ask what is fair to illegal immigrants, we must also ask what is fair to American families, students, taxpayers, and jobseekers.\nCongress now has the opportunity to advance responsible immigration reform that puts American jobs and American security first. We are facing the symptom of a larger problem, illegal immigration, along with the many other chronic immigration problems Washington has left unsolved. We must reform our green card system, which now favors low-skilled immigration and puts immense strain on U.S. taxpayers. We must base future immigration on merit – we want those coming into the country to be able to support themselves financially, to contribute to our economy, and to love our country and the values it stands for. Under a merit-based system, citizens will enjoy higher employment, rising wages, and a stronger middle class. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue have introduced the RAISE Act, which would establish this merit-based system and produce lasting gains for the American People.\nI look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to finally address all of these issues in a manner that puts the hardworking citizens of our country first.\nAs I've said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion – but through the lawful Democratic process – while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve. We must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans.\nAbove all else, we must remember that young Americans have dreams too. Being in government means setting priorities. Our first and highest priority in advancing immigration reform must be to improve jobs, wages and security for American workers and their families.\nIt is now time for Congress to act!", "timestamp": "2017-09-05", "title": "Statement on Immigration Reform"}

It is my great privilege on behalf of the First Family to say, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the swearing-in of the 20th Surgeon General of the United States of America, Doctor Jerome Adams. (Applause.)\nIt is a great privilege for me to be with you today to serve in this role. It's a great personal honor for me, as I'll reflect in a moment, having seen the quality of this physician, this public servant, this fellow Hoosier. (Applause.) Today has special meaning to me, as I know it does to President Trump.\nWe're joined also today not only by Dr. Adams, but by his wonderful family. Would you join me in welcoming his wonderful wife, Lacey, and their -- kids Caden, Eli, and Millie -- who are with us today? (Applause.) And his proud parents, Richard and Edrena Adams, are with us today from nearby Maryland. (Applause.) And his equally proud in-laws, Ked and Shelley Ringger, are with us today. Thank you so much. (Applause.) And what's the nephew's name? Everybody give Jalen (ph) a round of applause. (Applause.) Thanks, Jalen.\nIt's also a special honor to be joined by some very distinguished public servants whose presence here today speaks about their respect for Dr. Adams as our new Surgeon General, and the importance that they place on the role that he will play in the life of the nation. I'm grateful that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary and Dr. Tom Price, is with us. Thank you very much. (Applause.) The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, is with us. Seema, thank you so much for coming. (Applause.) The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, is with us today. Dr. Fitzgerald, thank you. (Applause.) And we're greatly honored to be joined by a senator from the state of Indiana, Senator Todd Young. Thank you for being with us today. (Applause.)\nThere are many distinguished guests and public servants who are in the room. I know it means a great deal to the President and to Dr. Adams and his family that you're with us today.\nI also want to acknowledge the presence of leading representatives of our medical community. Represented today is the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Association of Anesthesiologists, and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers. Your presence here today is a testament to Dr. Adams' well-deserved reputation in the medical profession and your enthusiasm for the President's decision to name him our newest Surgeon General. Thank you for your presence. (Applause.)\nPresident Donald Trump is committed -- he's committed to the health and well-being of the people of the United States of America. Today, America faces a number of urgent health challenges from the scourge of opioid abuse, infectious diseases, to the health threats arising from the devastating hurricane that beset our neighbors and friends in Texas just a little more than a week ago. The President is committed to tackling these challenges head on -- which is why the President has sought out America's most talented doctors and medical professionals to lead our health agencies. And now Dr. Jerome Adams will join them as Surgeon General of the United States.\nDr. Jerome Adams is highly qualified not just to serve, but to succeed on behalf of the American people. He's distinguished himself as an anesthesiologist at Eskenazi Hospital in Indianapolis, which serves some of our most vulnerable citizens, with some of the highest quality care in the country, and as a clinical associate professor of anesthesiology at Indiana University.\nAs I saw firsthand, Dr. Jerome Adams has an extraordinary gift for empathy, and he brought that gift to his years in public service. When I was governor of state of Indiana, it was my privilege to appoint him as the state health commissioner. And he would go on to serve my successor and two administrations in that role with great distinction.\nWhile I was governor, Dr. Adams dealt with many issues, including his efforts to reduce infant mortality through what he called the Labor of Love campaign that impacted the lives of innocent children and families.\nIn fact, he was only two days on the job when the nation was gripped with great anxiety over the Ebola virus. And it was Dr. Jerome Adams who stepped forward as our state's health commissioner, calmed the waters in Indiana and ensured that our citizens and our healthcare professionals had the information that they need.\nIn fact, Indiana was the location of the very first case of the MERS virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The very first case in the United States was reported in northwest Indiana, and Dr. Adams worked closely with the Centers for Disease Control in the midst of that and prevented the deadly outbreak from spreading beyond the initial patient.\nAnd during his tenure and mine, Indiana was rocked by the worst opioid-fueled-HIV epidemic ever to hit rural America. And as we confronted this crisis, it was Dr. Adams who led from the front, who provided me and my team with expert advice. And I saw that empathy for which he is so widely known when he worked directly with the citizens who had been infected, worked with the CDC, and brought the widest range of resources, policies, and care to stem that epidemic affecting that community.\nThrough these efforts, and more, Dr. Adams' intellect, experience helped improve the health and well-being of the people of Indiana. And the people of my home state will always be in your debt.\nBut, Jerome, the good people of Indiana will miss you because your President and the American people need you as our new Surgeon General of the United States. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump and I are confident that your leadership, your integrity, your empathy and compassion, and your values will help bring hope and healing to people all across this country.\nAnd so, on behalf of President Donald Trump, it is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great privilege to introduce to you the 20th Surgeon General of the United States of America, Dr. Jerome Adams. (Applause.)\nDR. ADAMS: Well, I'd like to start off by saying my thoughts and prayers are with the people who are dealing with the consequences of Hurricane Harvey, both the victims who have lost so much and all the brave Americans who are selflessly helping their fellow man, woman, and child.\nI am extraordinarily thankful to the President for his leadership in this time of crisis, and I'm anxious to get started so I can join the United States Public Health Corps and other governmental entities to rescue, rehabilitate, and rebuild.\nThank you very much, President Trump and Secretary Price, for having the faith in me to take on this task. And thank you for giving me this truly amazing opportunity to serve the people of our great country.\nA special thanks to a great mentor and friend, Vice President Pence. Thank you so much.\nThose of you who've watched my confirmation hearing know that one of the recurring themes I brought up was partnerships. I want to tell you a quick story about my shared history with the Vice President that illustrates the power of our partnership to positively affect millions of people in the state of Indiana.\nNow, I've been told that when the Vice President, as then-governor of Indiana, was vetting me to be his state health commissioner, he commented, well, he's qualified, but gosh, he seems young. (Laughter.)\nSomeone said to him, but, Governor, he's 40. To which the Governor then replied, but he's a really young-looking 40. (Laughter.)\nI take that as a great compliment, especially because I've got the hairdo of someone much older. (Laughter.) But the reality is initially he had some concerns about my ability to take on such a big role.\nThe Vice President has always been willing, however, to give people a chance to prove themselves. We had an extraordinarily diverse cabinet when he was governor, and he took a chance on this young, African American guy from the East Coast to be his health commissioner. And I thank you for that. (Applause.)\nNow here's the other side of the story. I had my doubts about working for him also, to be honest. (Laughter.) I didn't know a lot about then-Governor Pence. But the rumor was he was old school -- and not like the pop culture old school that the kids talk about, but older-super-conservative-from-southern-Indiana old school. I was worried about being able to relate to someone who was from such a different background than I was in all sorts of ways -- and someone who had so much hair than what I did. (Laughter.)\nThe one good thing is he's got the same hair as my dad, so that helped me trust him just a little bit more. (Laughter.)\nBut the point is, neither of us let those initial reservations get in the way of a discussion and a relationship. Together we dealt with the HIV crisis, successfully rolled out Indiana's state-based, consumer-driven alternative to Medicaid expansion -- thank you, Seema, so much for your work with that -- and worked with the state legislature to secure over $10 million to combat infant mortality in our state.\nIf the two of us could do that by working together and begin to have a positive influence on several health trends in our state, just imagine what all of us -- all of the people in this room, all of the people in this country -- could do if we simply would commit to not judging people, commit to coming together, commit to doing what we know is right in order to improve the health of the people of our country. (Applause.)\nThere's a great saying that bears worth repeating: Nobody is going to care what you know until they know that you care.\nNobody I've met is better at letting people know they care than Vice President Pence. I've tried to watch him. I've tried to listen to him, and I've tried to truly care about others as I've seen him do over the past several years of our relationship. And that's why my motto as Surgeon General is going to be: better health through better partnerships -- and why these partnerships will include people we traditionally have not thought of when we think about health.\nI completely agree with Secretary Price in his decision to focus on the opioid epidemic, mental health, and childhood obesity as top priorities. And I think better health through better partnerships, particularly with the business and law enforcement communities will help us address those priorities and many other health and wellness concerns.\nAnd speaking of partnerships, I want to close by thanking some very important partners who came to support me today. My friend and CMS Director Seema Verma, thank you so much for being here. Together we're committed to delivering higher quality healthcare at a lower cost through patient engagement and better prevention.\nI'm also happy to see former Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller in the crowd. Greg, raise your hand so everybody knows who you are. (Applause.) And current Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. (Applause.)\nNow you might get a little worried when you see two attorneys general following me around. (Laughter.) But the reality is one of the things I've consistently preached and I hope to continue to advocate is the need for better partnerships between the law enforcement and health communities if we're going to tackle this opioid epidemic.\nWe cannot continue to keep viewing interventions as either being too hard on individuals with a legitimate disease, or too soft on people who've committed real crimes.\nDr. Brenda Fitzgerald, Director of CDC, and Gerald Harmon, board chair of the American Medical Association, are also here. Leaders from the American Public Health Association, Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists, as Vice President Pence named, are also here and all deserve recognition.\nPresident Trump and Vice President Pence, it occurred to me, you've got leaders in health science, prevention. You've got law enforcement here. You've got state health officials who are charged with carrying out these tasks on a state level. I think we should just order dinner, lock the doors, and we'll get all this stuff solved in a few days. (Laughter and applause.)\nI'd like to thank acting Surgeon General Admiral Trent-Adams, Admiral Hunter, and Commander Collins for being here to represent the United States Public Health Service Corps. The Corps is America's health army -- 6,500 highly qualified and dedicated uniformed officers committed to being America's health army, keeping our country healthy and prosperous. I couldn't be more proud of the Health Corps members who are helping with the Hurricane Harvey response.\nAnd I'd like to thank all my family and friends who are here, including my father, Richard; my mother, Edrena; and my sister, Latoya (ph). Where are you, Latoya? And my three children -- Caden, Eli, and Millie. (Laughter and applause.)\nVice President Pence, I've also got a whole lot of nieces and nephews out here who are anxious for a selfie with you. (Applause.)\nFinally, I'd like to finish by doing something I've observed the Vice President do many times, I saved my last and my most heartfelt thanks for the person who gives me constant guidance and support, the person who keeps my family running and my life running while I'm off trying to save the world, the person who has been at my side for the good and the bad over the last 20 years, my lovely wife, Lacey. (Applause.)\nThank you again to President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Secretary Price for giving me this tremendous opportunity. I look forward to rolling up my sleeves and working to deliver to our country better health through better partnerships. I promise the American people that I am committed to letting the science lead me and to facilitating locally led solutions to our most difficult health problems.\nI promise you, the American people, that if you're willing to partner, I'm willing to go along with you and to help bring other folks to the table.\nTo borrow a phrase from our President, let's all work together to make American health great again. Thank you very much. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-09-05", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President and the Surgeon General at a Swearing-in Ceremony"}

I'm pleased to be here with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the two leaders of our tax-writing committee, Chairman Orrin Hatch and Chairman Kevin Brady, who have been working on tax reform for months with our Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, our National Economic Council Director.\nSince the day I took office, we've added 1.2 million private sector jobs, and a lot more than that if you go from the time we actually got elected, November 8th, including 125,000 manufacturing jobs. And we just had another very good month for manufacturing and the jobs. You probably all saw that.\nBut if we're going to keep this momentum going and allow the economy to truly take off as it should, it is vital that we reduce the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. We pay the highest tax of any country in the world on businesses and we can't keep doing that.\nLast week, I repeated my principles for tax reform. First, we must make the tax code as simple as possible. It's extremely complex, it's not fair, and it's extremely hard to understand. So we want to make it as simple as possible.\nSecond, we must provide tax relief for middle-class workers and families.\nThird, we must restore our competitive edge, which we've lost. We're doing fine, but we lost the competitive edge; you see what's going on all over the world. So we can have real job growth throughout America -- we can't be the jobs magnet of the world if we continue to tax our industries at rates 60 percent higher than companies in other countries. Can't do it.\nAnd finally, we must bring back trillions of dollars that are currently parked overseas. We have, in my opinion, $4 trillion -- $4 trillion. Massive amounts of money that can't come back to our country because of our tax code and because of the rates.\nAnd this is more than just tax reform,; this is tax cutting, to put it in a very simple term. We're going to cut taxes. We're going to reduce taxes for people, for individuals, for middle-income families. We are going to reduce taxes for our companies. And those companies are going to produce jobs.\nTax reform that follows these principles will create millions of new jobs and ensure that more products are stamped with the very beautiful letters and words: Made in the USA. It's time to lower our taxes, bring back our wealth, and make America the jobs magnet that it can become, and pretty quickly. It's really, in other words, an expression -- I don't know if too many of you have heard it -- it's time to make America great again. Has anybody heard that expression? (Laughter.)\nSo that's what we're doing. We're making America great again. You see it in the numbers, you see it with jobs, you see it with companies moving back in. They're moving back in at very, very big numbers. They're coming back into our country, and you haven't seen that for a long time. So we're very proud of that.\nSo we're now going to discuss tax reform and tax cuts, and I appreciate you being here. Thank you everybody, very much. Thank you.\nQ: Mr. President, how is you DACA position treating DREAMers \"with heart\"?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I have a great heart for the folks we're talking about -- a great love for them. And people think in terms of children, but they're really young adults. I have a love for these people, and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.\nAnd I can tell you, in speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. And really, we have no choice. We have to be able to do something, and I think it's going to work out very well. And long-term, it's going to be the right solution.\nThank you very much everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-09-05", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Meeting on Tax Reform"}

Trump\nRESPONSIBLY ENDING UNLAWFUL IMMIGRATION POLICY: Today, the Trump Administration is rescinding the previous Administration's memorandum creating the unlawful Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and has begun to end the program responsibly.\n* Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security explaining that DACA was not statutorily authorized and was therefore an unconstitutional exercise of discretion by the executive branch.\n* Attorney General Sessions found that DACA, given pending litigation, would likely face the same outcome as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program, which was enjoined by the courts.\n* The Trump Administration is taking responsible action to wind down DACA in an orderly and minimally disruptive manner.\n* If President Trump allowed DACA to go to court, it is likely that the court would abruptly enjoin the program.\n* If President Trump had refused to act, many States were prepared to pursue litigation to end DACA by court order.\n* Under the change announced today, current DACA recipients generally will not be impacted until after March 5, 2018, six months from now. That period of time gives Congress the opportunity to consider appropriate legislative solutions.\n* DHS's enforcement priorities remain in place. However, absent a law enforcement interest—which is largely the standard that has been in place since the inception of the program—the Department will generally not take actions to remove active DACA recipients.\n* DACA recipients range from ages 15 to 36, with the overwhelming majority being of adult age.\n* Initial requests for Employment Authorization Documents under DACA properly filed and accepted through today will be processed.\n* Additional DACA initial applications filed after today will not be accepted.\n* Renewal applications for DACA Employment Authorization Documents properly filed and accepted by October 5, 2017, for people whose current Employment Authorization Documents expire between today and March 5, 2018, will be processed.\n* Any such requests filed after October 5, 2017 will not be accepted.\n* Currently approved applications for advance parole for DACA recipients will generally be honored, but new applications will not be approved.\n* All pending applications for advance parole by DACA recipients will be closed and associated fees will be refunded.\nRESTORING LAW AND ORDER TO OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM: The DACA program was never intended to be permanent—even President Obama admitted it was a temporary, extraordinary measure. And President Obama repeatedly recognized that such unilateral actions were in excess of the Executive's appropriate role.\n* President Obama admitted publicly on at least a 22 occasions that creating a DACA-like program was beyond his authority. President Obama said:\n* In 2011, that \"there are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through Executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President.\"\n* In 2010, that providing people in America illegally with legal status and ignoring the laws on the books \"would be both unwise and unfair.\"\n* President Obama admitted in 2012 that DACA, implemented in an election year, was \"a temporary stopgap measure.\"\n* Partly because of DACA, the United States saw a surge in illegal immigration by minors in 2013-2014, because they hoped to take advantage of the program.\n* President Obama knew this would be a problem, admitting in 2010 that a DACA-like policy \"could lead to a surge in illegal immigration.\"\n* President Trump refuses to allow criminal activity to dominate our immigration system, taking action to restore the law and protect all Americans.\n* One of President Trump's first Executive orders informed sanctuary jurisdictions that failure to fully abide by Federal immigration laws would jeopardize access to certain Federal grant money.\n* As a result, Miami-Dade County reversed its years-long sanctuary policy.\n* The DOJ issued new charging guidelines in April to bring to an end the previous Administration's catch-and-release policies by prioritizing criminal immigration enforcement.\n* Since President Trump's inauguration, illegal immigration on the southwest border is down by 47 percent compared to the same period last year.\n* Illegal alien removals resulting from to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have increased by over 32 percent.\n* So far in Fiscal Year 2017, ICE has arrested at least 3,641 criminal gang members compared to 2,057 criminal gang members in all of Fiscal Year 2016.\nREFORMING IMMIGRATION TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN: DACA made it impossible for President Trump to pursue the reforms needed to restore fairness to our immigration system and protect American workers.\n* President Trump's highest obligation is to uphold the laws of the United States. So long as the unlawful policies of the previous Administration remain—especially those that incentivize further illegal immigration—there is no realistic chance of achieving principled pro-worker immigration reform. His priorities include:\n* Controlling the Border: President Trump intends to secure the southwest border with a border wall and a robust law enforcement presence on the border.\n* Improving Vetting and Immigration Security: Our immigration system, including our asylum and refugee system, make the United States potentially exposed to terrorist and public safety threats. We need to improve vetting and set limits that allow for proper vetting.\n* Enforcing Our Laws: President Trump supports the swift removal of those who illegally enter the United States or violate the conditions of their visas.\n* Protecting Our Workers: President Trump is working to encourage companies to raise wages and recruit American workers. This means stopping the practice of hiring illegal workers who unlawfully deprive American workers of jobs and higher wages.\n* Establishing a Merit-Based System for Entry: President Trump supports efforts to prioritize immigrants based on skills and thereby prevent the displacement of American workers.", "timestamp": "2017-09-05", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to Immigration"}
{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128202", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:54 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. This morning, faced with the very real possibility of a potential immediate shutdown of the entire DACA program by a federal court, President Trump took the responsible and constitutional step of announcing that the administration will be phasing out the program over the next two years.\nToday's September 5th deadline was set by the plaintiffs presenting the administration with two, and only two, real options to choose from: the likely sudden cancellation of the program by a judge or an orderly wind-down that preserves the rule of law and returns the question to the legislative branch where it belongs. The President chose the latter of the two options.\nThe President made the best decision in light of the fact that the system was set up by the Obama administration, in clear violation of federal law. President Obama even admitted this himself when announcing the program, calling it a \"temporary stopgap measure\" and calling on Congress to act.\nDACA was initiated after Congress explicitly rejected the same proposal in legislative form. In other words, President Obama didn't just suspend federal law, but implemented a policy Congress had explicitly rejected.\nThere is a misconception that DACA primarily serves as a shield from deportation. This is misleading. DACA grants work authorization to nearly 800,000 individuals who are not legally authorized to work. DACA recipients, whose average age is in their 20s, were not an enforcement priority before, and they certainly won't become a priority now. The priorities remain the same: criminals, security threats, and those who repeatedly violate our immigration laws.\nThe main effect of today's announcement is that work permits and other government benefits are being gradually phased out. But rather than leave DACA recipients and men and women of immigration enforcement in confusing limbo, while the DACA program was challenged by states in the same court that struck down another of the previous administration's unlawful immigration orders earlier this year, President Obama [sic] is laying out a responsible 24-month phase-out -- sorry, President Trump. (Laughter.)\nNo permits will be expiring for another six months, and permits will remain active for up to two full years. The President was elected partly on his promise to deliver meaningful immigration reform that puts the jobs, wages, and security of the American people first. He is delivering on that promise every day, and he has put forward serious proposals to Congress that would responsibly end illegal immigration, prevent visa overstays, remove dangerous criminals, protect American jobs and wages, and create a merit-based system that grows our middle class.\nThese are not just President Trump's priorities; they are the American people's priorities. For decades now, the American people, immigrant and U.S.-born, have asked Congress to establish a lawful immigration system that protects our country. They've asked for strong, secure borders, they've asked us to protect American security and American jobs, and they've asked us to have compassion, not only for those who are here illegally, but for unemployed American citizens, including millions of unemployed African American and Hispanic citizens who continue to suffer under a broken system.\nThe President's DACA decision today brings us closer to a safer, fairer, and legal immigration system. Now that he has ended this unsustainable and unconstitutional program imposed by the previous administration, the President is calling on the men and women in Congress to fulfill their duty to the American people by truly reforming our immigration system for the good of all people.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. John.\nQ: Sarah, one question that went unanswered today was, some 359 members of the DACA program enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2016. Their tour of duty would run the standard four years, I would assume, but their DACA status would only last two years. If there's no fix by Congress before March the 5th, do you know what will happen to those people? Will they become ineligible to remain in the military, or will there be special dispensation? Has that been worked out?\nMS. SANDERS: We have confidence that Congress is going to step up and do their job. This is something that needs to be fixed legislatively, and we have confidence that they're going to do that. And we stand ready and willing to work with them in order to accomplish responsible immigration reform, and that would include -- DACA is certainly part of that process.\nQ: There are many Republicans who believe that getting something on the Republican side is not going to be easy; that the divisions that we see between the center and the right in the Republican Party will become only deeper. What gives you confidence that this will actually happen?\nMS. SANDERS: With all due respect, I don't think the American people elected Congress to do things that were easy. They elected them to make a government that works, to work properly, and to work for American people. And that's their job. And if they can't do it, then they need to get out of the way and let somebody else who can take on a heavy lift and get things accomplished.\nMajor.\nQ: Sarah, in the context of DACA as a piece of legislation, would the President be willing to sign only something that addresses that? Or would it also be to have components of the RAISE Act? Would there need to be funding for the border wall? Or would he be willing to sign something that simply addresses DACA legislatively?\nMS. SANDERS: The President wants to see responsible immigration reform, and he wants that to be part of it. But again, we can't take just a one-piece fix. We've got to do an overall immigration reform that's responsible and, frankly, that's lawful. And that's what the President wants to see Congress do.\nQ: What would be the priorities for him in a comprehensive reform package? It would be DACA and what else?\nMS. SANDERS: And certainly to control the border, to improve vetting and immigration security, enforce our laws, and do things that protect American workers.\nQ: Let me ask you a question on North Korea. In the President's mind, is it an option to simply contain a North Korea that possess nuclear weapons?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly the priority of the administration is to have denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and it's also to protect American citizens. But certainly the priority would be that.\nPhil.\nQ: Sarah, you're talking about a comprehensive immigration fix from Congress in a span of six months, and much to the President's frustration, Congress hasn't been able to really do much at all this year. What gives him confidence that they're going to be able to act on immigration? Has he spoken to any congressional leaders since making this DACA decision?\nMS. SANDERS: He's spoken to a number of leaders, but hopefully, as you guys all know, they just came back from a three-week vacation. I think that they should be rested and ready to take on some big challenges that America faces.\nQ: Why put the fate of the lives of 800,000 DREAMers, people --\nMS. SANDERS: Because it's Congress's job to legislate. It's not the President's job to create law. It's Congress's job to create legislation. I think that's something we all learned in 8th grade civics; I know I certainly did. And I think that every member of Congress should know that that is their duty, and we're asking them to fulfill it. It's pretty simple.\nQ: Do you think they'll be able to do it?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the American people elected them to do it. And again, if they can't, then they should get out of the way and let somebody else take their job that can actually get something done.\nSteve.\nQ: What consideration are you giving to negotiations with North Korea, over the nuclear program?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think in the terms of negotiations, we're looking at putting aggressive measures, both diplomatically, economically. And as we've said, all options are on the table and we're going to continue to push for a safer and denuclearized Korean Peninsula. And that's the priority here.\nJim.\nQ: It sounds the President is saying, and your saying, that if we're going to allow the DREAMers to stay in this country, we want a wall. Is that accurate?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that the President has been shy about the fact that he wants a wall, and certainly something that he feels is an important part of a responsible immigration reform package.\nQ: Can I ask you one follow-up question? Why did the President not come out and make this announcement himself today? Why did he leave it to his Attorney General? It's his decision. These kids -- their lives are on the line because of what he is doing. Why not have him come out and make this call?\nMS. SANDERS: It's in large part a big part of the legal process. This was deemed illegal by, I think, just about every legal expert that you can find in the country, including many of Obama's own attorneys said that this was not a lawful program. And therefore it would be the Department of Justice to make a legal recommendation, and that's what they did.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Quick question, yes or no, and then a follow-up. Would the President sign a standalone DACA extension?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I have addressed this. The President is hoping to work with Congress on responsible immigration reform, and I laid out the priorities that the administration has on that front.\nQ: So the President has voiced, and you've voiced, some objections to the constitutionality of DACA. Where does the President stand on the program itself?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that in the answers that I have given, is that the President has been -- and I think part of the reason that this is complicated, and one of the reasons he's wrestled with this back and forth, in large part is because this is not an easy one, and certainly something where he wants to be able to make a decision with compassion, but at the same time you can't allow emotion to govern. And this has to be something where the law is put in place and it's something that he would support if Congress puts it before him.\nQ: You would support it, if it came with -- I am just trying to get the specifics\nMS. SANDERS: Again, responsible immigration reform. We can't just have one tweet to the immigration system; we need really big fixes and big reform in this process. And we've laid out the principles that we feel are important in that.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Is this a position -- what?\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry, John Decker.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. The President had, recently as February, expressed sympathy for the DACA recipients. Today we heard in a statement from House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said that these so-called DREAMers have done nothing wrong. Was this a difficult decision for the President to take this drastic action, given what he's said as recently as February? And does he agree with House Speaker Paul Ryan that these individuals -- 800,000 individuals -- have done nothing wrong?\nMS. SANDERS: I think largely, yes, and that's why I said it was one of the things that the President wrestled with this decision all throughout the weekend. So I kind of addressed that, so I think that's pretty clear.\nQ: It was just this weekend that he wrestled with it? It wasn't leading up to it?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, no -- I mean, I think we've been clear throughout the process. There wasn't a final decision made until over the weekend because of the back-and-forth and the complexity of the issue, and the ability to make the right decision, and allow Congress to actually do their job and provide a fix, instead of just stopping the program. And that was a big point for the President.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I want to drill down a little more on what you mean when you say the President wants to act with heart and compassion in regard to these DACA recipients. Does that mean offering them a pathway to citizenship?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it means providing a more permanent solution that's done through the legislative process; done legally and responsibly, unlike the previous administration.\nQ: A permanent solution -- does that mean you're giving them legal status, legislatively? Like, what is the permanent solution that the President --\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's something we want to work with Congress to determine exactly what that looks like. But there has to be -- something needs to be done. It's Congress's job to do that, and we want to be part of that process. And make sure that there is a fix put in place and that this isn't ignored, like it has been for the last five years.\nQ: If Congress doesn't get it done by the March 5th deadline, considering the President's personal feelings about these DACA recipients, would he consider giving them additional time to get a solution passed?\nMS. SANDERS: We'd like to have confidence that Congress will actually do their job. We're going ask that they do that and that they allow us to work with them and be part of that process. But again, if Congress doesn't want to do the job that they were elected to do, then maybe they should get out of the way and let someone else do it.\nSteven.\nQ: Sarah, when we heard from the Attorney General this morning, he repeatedly referred to DACA recipients as illegal aliens. And at one point he intimated that hundreds of thousands of Americans did not get jobs that were taken by DACA recipients. Does the President share that view?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that it's a known fact that there are over 4 million unemployed Americans in the same age group as those that are DACA recipients; that over 950,000 of those are African Americans in the same age group; over 870,000 unemployed Hispanics in the same age group. Those are large groups of people that are unemployed that could possibly have those jobs.\nBut again, we're looking for fixes. We're not looking for complaints but we're looking for solutions. And that's our focus moving forward.\nQ: How do you reconcile those statistics with the idea that hundreds of thousands of people, if the President gets what he wants, could achieve legal status? How do you reconcile those two competing interests?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I think one of the first things is, the President is looking to create a whole lot more jobs in America so that it addresses both problems. There's a reason he's focused largely, since day one of taking office, in creating a better market for businesses to create jobs, to hire more people, higher wages.\nHe's gotten rid of over 800 regulations that have helped do just that. 1.2 million jobs have been created since he came into office, and every single day we're looking for more ways to grow that number. And so we're doing our part to address and create an environment that allows people to have more jobs. And we're going to continue doing that.\nKristen.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. The President vowed to treat DREAMers with \"great heart.\" How is this move treating them with great heart?\nMS. SANDERS: I think by allowing an orderly process to take place. You know, there's a lot of people that I've seen attacking the President for not showing the level of compassion that they feel like he should. To me, the most heartless thing that I've seen all day today is that Democrats, like Nancy Pelosi, are using this decision today for fundraising while the President is trying to fix this situation. They are politicizing an issue instead of actually doing their job.\nIf they would spend less time fundraising and more time focusing on solutions, we wouldn't even be in this problem in the first place.\nQ: But keeping it on the President's decision, where all of this stems from, the DREAMers, the supporters of DREAMers says this is cold-hearted; you're leaving the future of 800,000 people uncertain, up in the air. What's your message to them?\nMS. SANDERS: It's not cold-hearted for the President to uphold the law. We are a nation of law and order. And the day that we start to ignore the fact that we are that, then we throw away everything that gives these people a reason to want to come to our country. If we stop becoming the country that we were envisioned to be, then we throw away what makes us special, what makes America unique. This President is not willing to do that. The previous administration was; this one isn't.\nBut we want to have real solutions. We want to have laws that address these problems, but it's Congress's job to legislate, not the President's. And we actually want to uphold the Constitution, and I think people across this country should be celebrating the fact that they have a President that is standing up and upholding the Constitution as he was elected to do.\nMargaret.\nQ: I'd like to ask you about North Korea. But quickly on DACA, is the President committed to honoring the will of Congress, essentially whatever Congress passes on DACA? Or does he reserve the right to veto a DACA fix if he feels that it doesn't kind of holistically do what you're talking about -- a bigger-picture thing that touches on some of these things?\nMS. SANDERS: As I've said, we want responsible immigration reform, and that would be part of that package and part of that process.\nQ: And then on North Korea, if I could just ask. Vladimir Putin has said that he doesn't believe that sanctions are going to work at all against North Korea. And I'm wondering whether the President himself is coming around to that perspective, or whether he still believes sanctions can be effective, and if he has any plans that you could share with us to talk with the Chinese President or the Russian President himself.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we've been clear about what our priorities are; that now is not the time for us to spend a lot of time focused on talking with North Korea, but putting all measures of pressure that we can. And we're going to continue through that process.\nWe've also said that everybody, including Russia, including China, need to do more to address the threat. This is a global threat, and everybody needs to take part in putting pressure on North Korea. And as we've said many times before, both Secretary Mattis and the President, that all options are on the table, and we're going to continue to keep them on the table until we get the results that we're looking for.\nQ: Sarah, the President has said that the DACA recipient should \"rest easy.\" He's also said on several occasions that he loves them. Is he giving them his personal assurance that at the end of six months they will not be deported?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he is giving Congress the ability to do their job. I've said that earlier --\nQ: What does \"rest easy\" mean when he said they should rest easy?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President gave the ability for us to have a six-month process for Congress to actually step up and fix this problem. And they certainly have the ability to, and certainly should take that opportunity.\nQ: One other question about -- during the other immigration moves that the administration has made, you made the argument that the President's powers over immigration are very, very broad and unquestioned. Why in this case does he feel he can't do anything by himself and he has to turn it over to Congress?\nMS. SANDERS: That was a specific statute within the Constitution that allows the President to take action to protect Americans. These are two very different things and certainly not apples to apples.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions. On DACA --\nMS. SANDERS: Two-question Tuesday.\nQ: Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a close ally of the President's, denounced the decision because of the six-month delay in it, and said there should be no phase-out; it should have been implemented immediately. What's your response to that criticism from a strong supporter and ally of the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I think our response is pretty clear. The President made a decision, and we feel very much that it was the right one.\nQ: The other thing is that you talk about 4 million jobs that could go to other people. Has the President ever discussed this part of DACA with some of the leaders of organized labor to try to involve them in the process -- President Trumka of the AFL-CIO, President Hoffa of the Teamsters, and others that they work with?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about specific conversations on that exact figure, but I do know that he has had conversations with individuals and relevant stakeholders in this process on both sides that know that that is an issue.\nWhether DACA existed or not, the fact that there are 4 million people in this age group that are unemployed and certainly why creating a better job market is a priority for the administration.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I wanted to follow up on what Jim asked. I don't know that we heard back here the rest of your answer.\nYou said that the reason that Attorney General Jeff Sessions put out the earlier statement on camera was because it was a legal argument. But a lot of what we've been talking about in here is a legislative argument. Why have we not heard from the President directly on this day? And can we expect to hear from him later today on this?\nMS. SANDERS: You have heard directly from the President. He issued a pretty lengthy statement directly from the President.\nQ: Why was it Attorney General Jeff Sessions that went on camera when the President hasn't gone on camera to make this case today about what a big heart he has and how compassionate he is, and how he wants Congress to take legislative action on this to essentially save DACA?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has spoken about this numerous times in the past. But at the same time, this was a legal issue because there was a court decision that had to be made with a timeline not placed -- that the administration created, but a timeline that was created by the attorney generals in those states that were forcing this issue and this decision to take place by today. It was a legal decision, and that would fall to the Attorney General, and that's why he would be the one making the announcement.\nPeter.\nQ: Talking about stakeholders, has the President met any enrollees in the DACA program?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe he has had several conversations with enrollees and those that have been part of the program.\nQ: Can you tell us anything about that -- in what context, and what he got out of those conversations?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, again, I think that the President's goal was to talk to a lot of people on both sides of the issue, and, one, do what it takes to uphold the law, uphold the Constitution, but also allow Congress to create a permanent solution and fix the problem, which he's done by allowing for that six-month period.\nQ: He's had those conversations recently as part of this recent deliberation?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not sure on the exact timeline, but I know he has had many conversations with people on both sides of this issue, certainly people that support keeping it as is and those that support getting rid of it.\nQ: (Inaudible) people will be affected by it, though, right?\nMS. SANDERS: Right. Again, like I said, he's, I know, had conversations with people that have been part of the program.\nCatherine.\nQ: Sarah, you said the President wrestled with the decision all weekend. Can he walk us through any of the process he went through to get to this -- when did he make this decision, who was he consulting with, and how this came about?\nMS. SANDERS: He made the final decision over the weekend. And as I said, he spoke to many relevant stakeholders and individuals that support a variety of positions on this program.\nQ: Sarah, can you tell us anything about the meeting today -- the Big 6, what are you expecting out of that? Is there anything you're hoping to get out of that?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll continue to keep you guys posted. I think the ultimate goal is, as Congress is coming back into session, to talk about some of the big priorities -- certainly tax reform, immigration reform, among many other things that are going to be on the agenda for the fall.\nNoah. I'll go here, and then I'll come back to you.\nQ: The President has basically told Congress to do this, but he hasn't written any legislation, similar to how he approached --\nMS. SANDERS: I didn't know it was the President's job to write out specific details of legislation. (Laughter.) I think that's exactly what the --\nQ: Well, other Presidents with their major initiatives have taken a greater role in helping to craft that legislation. They found friendly allies in Congress to actually be the ones to propose it, but this President has not. Why hasn't he made that shift? And does he think it's -- is he reconsidering it in light of the fact that some of the other major pushes he's tried to make have not been successful legislatively?\nMS. SANDERS: We've laid out detailed principles, and we have worked with members of Congress on specific pieces of the legislation, and we'll continue to do that.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Quick international question. The situation in Myanmar is quickly escalating to a major humanitarian crisis. Has the President been briefed on the situation in Myanmar? If so, is he planning to speak to any of the leaders during the upcoming meeting about this situation?\nMS. SANDERS: I know this is something that we're monitoring closely, but I'm not aware of any specific conversations that are planned at this time. But as always, in calls like that, we will keep you guys posted and put a readout after.\nCecilia.\nQ: The President says that DREAMers won't be a priority for enforcement, but that's not a guarantee of protection. Is this White House willing to offer one?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, they're not a targeted priority. But the goal here is that Congress actually fixes the problem, and then that isn't an issue. And so that's the focus over the next six months, is making sure that something takes place, that Congress does their job, and a real solution is implemented.\nQ: But is there a way to put this in writing so that these 800,000 people who are very fearful of ending up in a country that they don't know have some guarantee that, in fact, they won't be deported in, say, 6 months?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the statement that the President put out earlier today lays out what the priorities are and lays out what the focus of the administration is, and that they are not targets -- they are certainly not priority targets of this administration. They weren't before, and they won't be now.\nAnd again, Congress has six months, which is a pretty long time to get something done. And we hope they do, and there's a solution in that so that this isn't a problem moving forward.\nAnita.\nQ: I was wondering -- you mentioned that the President had spoken over the weekend or in recent days to various stakeholders. We had talked to the attorney general's office in Texas and they had said that they did not get a heads up or nobody conferring with them about this. Did you all talk to the 10 states, and are you positive that they are not suing?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that various members of the administration have been in contact with individuals in those states.\nI'm going to wrap here, but I have one note -- I have one thing I'd like to just add. The President will be announcing the donations that he will be personally making to the various charities. And thank you to those who have submitted; we had several people put in submissions, and he'll be doing that tomorrow.\nAnd again, I know there were a lot of questions over the weekend. That will be a personal donation of $1 million from the President to various organizations and charities, many of which came from this room. So thank you again for that.\nHope you have a good day.\nEND 2:20 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-09-05", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

It lasted for about 45 minutes. He's very much in favor of the denuke of North Korea, and we're talking about different things. We have some things -- we're going to be talking again soon, and we'll see how that works out.\nWe had a very good meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. We agreed to a three-month extension on debt ceiling, which they consider to be sacred -- very important -- always we'll agree on debt ceiling automatically because of the importance of it.\nAlso on the CRs and also on Harvey, which now we're going to be adding something because of what's going on in Florida -- but we had a very good meeting. We essentially came to a deal, and I think the deal will be very good. We had a very, very cordial and professional meeting.\nSo we have an extension, which will go out to December 15th. That will include the debt ceiling, that will include the CRs, and it will include Harvey -- the amount of money to be determined, but it will include -- because everyone is in favor obviously of taking care of that situation. So we all very much agree.\nQ: Mr. President, what do you say to those who say there are mixed signals coming from the White House over DACA?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No mixed signal at all. Congress, I really believe, wants to take care of this situation. I really believe it -- even very conservative members of Congress. I've seen it firsthand. If they don't, we're going to see what we're going to do.\nBut I will tell you, I really believe Congress wants to take care of it. We discussed that also today, and Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I. And I said if we can get something to happen, we're going to sign it and we're going to make a lot of happy people.\nQ: Do you want a pathway to citizenship for those DACA recipients?\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's going to be discussed later, but we want to talk about legal right now. We haven't discussed that.\nQ: What did you mean when you said you wanted to revisit the issue in six months?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to see what happens. I want to see what happens in Congress. I have a feeling that's not going to be necessary. I think they're going to make a deal. I think Congress really wants to do this.\nQ: And what would you like to see, Mr. President, in legislation?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'd like to see something where we have good border security, and we have a great DACA transaction where everybody is happy and now they don't have to worry about it anymore because, obviously, as you know, before, it was not a legal deal. It was a deal that wouldn't have held up and didn't hold up. And even President Obama when he did it, when he signed it, he said this is obviously not something that's -- he called it short-term.\nI'd like to see a permanent deal, and I think it's going to happen. I think we're going to have great support from both sides of Congress, and I really believe that Congress is going to work very hard on the DACA agreement and come up with something.\nMS. WALTERS: I think we're about to takeoff, if you want to head back.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay. Sit down, don't get hurt anybody. Okay?

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128197", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Bismarck, North Dakota\n3:14 P.M. EDT\nMS. WALTERS: Good afternoon, everyone. We've had an eventful flight. We're almost in Bismarck, North Dakota. I wanted to start by giving you a brief hurricane update:\nWhile we continue to focus on the critical rebuilding and recovery efforts in Texas, we are closely monitoring Hurricane Irma. We urge all residents and tourists in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to listen to local authorities during this dangerous storm.\nThe White House, FEMA, and all federal agency partners stand ready to assist. I can tell you that, today, the President spoke to the governors of Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nSo, as you all know, tax reform is at the top. As we move to Bismarck, North Dakota, tax reform is at the top of the President's agenda. The President has been speaking about simplifying our tax code for the benefit of all Americans since the early days of the campaign. And here we are, on our way to North Dakota, to see him again demonstrate this commitment to the American people.\nFixing our broken tax code is the single-most important action that we can take to boost our economy and help the middle class get ahead. We must streamline in order to eliminate advantages for those who work the system. We must inspire job creation and wage growth. We must encourage multinational companies to invest their money in the United States. And we must provide tax relief for middle-income Americans.\nIn doing so, this tax reform will bring jobs, bring back wealth, and bring back hope. This will ultimately result in a better life for all Americans.\nFollowing the productive conversations that took place yesterday with key members of Congress and his administration, and again this morning with the bipartisan congressional leadership, the President is now on his way to Bismarck to address the issue with the American people at the Andeavor Refinery. This is the President's first trip to North Dakota and his fifth trip west of the Mississippi River since his inauguration.\nNorth Dakota has demonstrated history of bipartisan support for tax reform. In 1986, the last time Congress passed major tax reform, President Reagan's tax plan received support from a Democratic senator in North Dakota. The President is looking forward to a meaningful discussion today with Senator Heitkamp to continue this bipartisan legacy as he continues to encourage cooperation over congressional leaders across the aisle on such an important issue.\nOnly through such cooperation will productive work begin this fall to ensure this critical legislation makes its way through Congress and ends up on the President's desk.\nOne thing additionally to highlight today: The President will continue to contrast the offshoring model that has resulted from the current tax code with the American model that our reforms will implement. As you know, we have four principles: We need to cut the a tax code that is simple, fair, easy, and -- easy to understand. We will cut taxes for middle-class families. We will restore our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for all Americans. And we will bring back trillions of dollars currently parked overseas.\nTo give you three excerpts from today's speech -- excerpt number one: \"I want all Americans to be inspired by the North Dakota example. This state is a reminder of what can happen when we promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.\"\nSecond example: \"Both the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic Speaker, and the vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, including the Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota. If Democrats continue their obstruction, if they don't want to bring back your jobs, raise your pay, and help America win, voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America or find a new job.\"\nWith that, one other thing that has been on the top of a lot of your questions today has been the President and First Lady's personal donation to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. I'm proud to let you know that, today, President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump announced a personal donation of $1 million to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, and have designated 12 organizations to receive contributions.\nThe President and First Lady witnessed the work of some of these groups firsthand while visiting with hurricane survivors, first responders, volunteers, and federal, state, and local officials, and are proud to further assist the recovery efforts in Texas.\nSeveral of the following organizations were recommended at the invitation of the President by members of the White House Press Corps. He would like to thank those who made recommendations for their attention to this important cause. The President and First Lady continue to pray for the people of Texas and Louisiana. The organizations in which the President and First Lady will be donating to are: Reachout America, Red Cross, Salvation Army, Samaritan's Purse, ASPCA, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Habitat for Humanity, Houston Humane Society, Operation Blessing, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies, and Team Rubicon.\nWith that, I will take your questions.\nQ: Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, Stanley Fischer, resigned today. I'm wondering whether the White House has any reaction and if you can give us any insight into timing for filling some of the empty spots on the Fed.\nMS. WALTERS: I believe Mr. Fischer was going to put out a statement this afternoon, if he hasn't done so already. We have no announcement at this time, and we'll keep you abreast as we have a personnel announcement for that position.\nQ: The last time the President did a trip like this for tax reform, he called out the Democratic senator in Missouri by name. He was pretty tough on her. Senator Heitkamp, of course, traveled with him today. Is she going to get similar treatment or different treatment?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to get ahead of how the President -- what he's going to say in his speech. But as you saw, the President is committed to reaching across the aisle and having this be a bipartisan effort to pass tax reform. You mentioned the Senator is on board today with us.\nQ: I know the President came back and told us earlier about the three-month extension. Is that three months -- is that what he asked for, or was that a negotiation, a compromise with the Democrats? That three-month extension, did he want something longer?\nMS. WALTERS: There are a lot of items that are on the President's agenda this fall. Pushing this three months allows us to focus on tax reforms and those other issues that are important right now as we move forward.\nQ: They have the money for the hurricane relief. Is that coming from the Trump Foundation or from the President's personal bank account?\nMS. WALTERS: The President and First Lady are making this donation. I believe it is from them. I will confirm that for you, but I believe it is their personal account.\nQ: And then also, the tax reform bill that you guys are referring to as an example of bipartisan cooperation that Reagan signed into law, my understanding was that was a revenue-neutral piece of legislation. Is that something that the President is hoping to achieve with his tax reform bill?\nMS. WALTERS: The President is hoping to get a tax reform bill that works for all Americans. As we said, this is something that needs to build up the middle class.\nQ: Lindsay, one of the big questions around DACA is what will happen to those who are serving in the military. Has the White House considered what will happen in particular to these Americans, or these DREAMers specifically?\nMS. WALTERS: The White House is hopeful that Congress will do their job. We've called on Congress to take action. They have six months to put a bill on the President's desk to be signed, and we hope that Congress gets to work and does their job.\nQ: The President said that if they didn't, he would revisit the issue, suggesting that he'd take some kind unilateral action if they don't do anything in six months.\nMS. WALTERS: The President called on Congress to address DACA and other immigration reforms. If Congress does not take action on its own initiative, the President will make the case more directly to the American people to help ensure that Congress does its job.\nQ: Only at the end of six months he's going to make his case to the people?\nQ: What does that mean?\nMS. WALTERS: The President has called on Congress. Congress has six months to act, and that's what they need to do right now.\nQ: And if they fail, what happens? What does he do?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to speak to hypotheticals. Congress has six months to --\nQ: He raised the hypothetical, so --\nQ: He said he would revisit it.\nMS. WALTERS: The President addressed this earlier. As I said to you, the President has called on Congress. If Congress does not take action on its own initiative, the President will make his case more directly to the American people.\nBut right now, Congress needs to act. We need to be asking the question of Congress: Are you going to do your job? What are you going to do to ensure that in six months there is a bill on the President's desk?\nQ: What case is he going to make to the American people? Is it, you should provide protection for these DREAMers? Or should pass a border security bill? I mean, what is the case he is going to be making after that time?\nMS. WALTERS: I go back to what I said; why don't we ask Congress if they're going to do their job? Congress has six months to place a bill on the President's desk and to have real and responsible immigration reform. And that's what they need to do. They need to work on immigration reform, and let's look at Congress and see if they can get something done in the next six months.\nQ: Would the President sign a clean DACA bill just to do with the DREAMers and restoring their status?\nMS. WALTERS: Right now we're focused on Congress doing their job and passing a responsible and real immigration reform.\nWith that, because I know we're about to land, I'm going to let Marc Short take a few questions, since he's here with me, to speak this morning about the meeting that occurred with the Minority Leaders.\nMR. SHORT: And I just want to answer your questions. I think the President talked earlier about the cordial environment in the meeting and the need to have a bipartisan solution on several of the big issues we're facing. And as Lindsay mentioned to you, we believe that helping to clear the decks in September enables us to focus on tax reform for the American people. We need to get the economy growing again, and that's what the President is focused on.\nQ: Marc, on DACA, why couldn't you say what the White House is doing behind the scenes to get a deal on the President's desk six months from now? What will that deal look like? What will the White House --\nMR. SHORT: Well, behind the scenes, I wouldn't bring it out here in front of you. But I think that you'll see the administration looking forward to lay out its principles in a broad sense on what we would want to see done. I think the President has also made clear that he does believe that we need to help ensure border security.\nQ: And will the President be engaging now? Why wait six months from now to get engaged?\nMR. SHORT: I think the President has been engaged all along on these issues, and you'll continue to see him engaged.\nQ: Marc, on the debt ceiling, members of the Freedom Caucus and other members -- Republican members in the House -- were not thrilled with tying the debt ceiling to Harvey relief and the CR. Is the President going to be talking to them, reaching out to make his case of why to support that deal?\nMR. SHORT: I have a meeting with members of the Freedom Caucus tomorrow, and I've heard other Freedom Caucus members make the case for a shorter-term debt ceiling extension.\nQ: Tied to the Harvey relief?\nMR. SHORT: They made a case for a short-term extension. They're going to, it looks like, get a shorter-term extension.\nQ: Marc, how concerned is the White House, if at all, that having this three-month deal expire when it does in December puts extra pressure on tax reform? I mean, does it pose risk for messing that up in terms of the timing?\nMR. SHORT: I think it puts pressure on all of us to get tax reform done before December. I think that we know that the economy has struggled for too long, and we need to get it turned around.\nSo it does help to put it front and center for all of us, and that's what we need to be focused on for the next three months. Because you're right, December is going to have a lot on the plate.\nQ: On tax reform, is the President still committed to a 15 percent corporate rate? Or is he willing to negotiate on that at all?\nMR. SHORT: The President wants a 15 percent corporate rate.\nMS. WALTERS: Okay, I think we're going to head back, as you guys can feel the turbulence.\nThanks again.\nQ: Do you think you'll have something more on Fischer later then?\nMS. WALTERS: Not today. Fischer was putting out a statement, though -- which probably came out while we were in the air.\nQ: The White House isn't going to have a --\nMS. WALTERS: Let me get back to you on that. We don't have a personnel announcement at this time. So should there be --\nQ: And no reaction to him leaving, in the sense that he's a very senior guy --\nMS. WALTERS: Let me get back to you on that.\nQ: Yeah, yeah, okay. Thank you.\nMS. WALTERS: You're welcome.\nEND 3:26 P.M.

Trump\nTAX REFORM FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH: President Donald J. Trump's tax reform will revitalize the American economy and create millions of jobs.\n* Reforming our outdated tax system is critical to boosting economic growth from the recent annual average of 2 percent to 3 percent or more.\n* Over the next ten years this sustained increase in growth will create:\n* 12 million new jobs,\n* $10 trillion in additional economic activity, and\n* $3 trillion in budgetary savings.\nA RECORD OF ECONOMIC SUCCESS: President Donald J. Trump is following past successful tax reforms to jumpstart the economy, create jobs in America, and boost wages.\n* Under existing policies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects economic growth to be stuck at 2 percent for the next ten years. Tax relief and reform can boost economic growth, create jobs, and raise wages for working Americans.\n* Tax cuts, like those included in President' Trump's tax reform package, boost economic growth, according to the Tax Foundation.\n* President Bush's 2001 tax cuts contributed 2.3 percent to economic growth over ten years.\n* President Clinton's 1997 tax cut contributed 0.8 percent to economic growth over ten years.\n* President Reagan's 1986 corporate income tax cut contributed 3.3 percent to economic growth over ten years.\n* President Reagan's 1981 tax cuts contributed 8 percent to economic growth over ten years.\n* President Kennedy's 1962 and 1964 tax cuts contributed 6.2 percent to economic growth over ten years.\n* Tax reform, including tax cuts, encourages the investment needed to create jobs so Americans can get back to work at well-paying jobs, according to Freedom Partners.\n* After President Bush's 2003 tax cuts, the economy created 6.9 million new jobs over five years.\n* After President Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, the economy created 11.7 million new jobs over five years.\n* After President Kennedy's tax cuts, the economy created 9.3 million new jobs over five years.\n* A crushing tax burden on American companies is really a crushing tax burden on American workers.\n* Economists agree that America's corporate tax harms America's workers by keeping their wages low.\n* According to one study by the CBO, more than 70 percent of the corporate tax burden is put on American workers.\nAMERICAN ENERGY POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM TAX REFORM: President Trump has prioritized the energy sector to help create greater energy independence and is well-positioned to benefit from tax reform and bring back a Made-in-America economy.\n* President Trump and his Administration have acted aggressively to increase exports of our energy resources to the global market. The Trump Administration has:\n* Updated guidance from the Treasury Department to allow the United States to promote investments in overseas coal development in a meaningful way.\n* Expedited the permitting and approval processes of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals and exports, including the approval of the Lake Charles LNG terminal in Louisiana.\n* This regulatory streamlining will accelerate the rebuilding of the community around Lake Charles, an area that has been hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.\n* President Trump has unleashed oil and gas development in the United States by expanding access to resources and the infrastructure needed to get energy to market. President Trump has:\n* Approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, creating over 42,000 jobs and $2 billion in earnings.\n* Signed an Executive Order to help ensure that future pipeline work will be done by American workers and with American steel.\n* Expedited new pipeline approval and production, such as the New Burgos Pipeline to Mexico.\n* Signed an Executive Order to extend offshore oil and gas drilling and reissued a leasing program to develop offshore resources.\n* Boosted oil and gas development on Federal lands.\n* The Environmental Protection Agency is reconsidering an Obama-era rule on greenhouse gas emissions that is estimated to cost oil and natural gas operators as much as $530 million annually.\n* President Trump kept his campaign promise to coal miners and rolled back the previous administration's \"Stream Protection Rule,\" which targeted the beleaguered industry with estimated costs of at least $81 million per year.", "timestamp": "2017-09-06", "title": "Press Release - Tax Reform Unleashes America's Economic Potential"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128283", "text": "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I was just with our governor. He said, you know, Mr. President, we could have had 25 times the number of people, but for policy speeches, they like to keep them just like this. But I appreciate -- this is tremendous. And this is truly a tremendous state. And we appreciate it very much. We appreciate you being here. Thank you. (Applause.)\nAnd the policy we're talking about is cutting your taxes. Do you like that policy? (Applause.) Well, you're the hardworking people who provide the energy that makes this country run, and we are finally getting the government out of the way so you can do your jobs. Finally happening. (Applause.)\nPrior to leaving the White House, I had a great bipartisan meeting with Democrat and Republican leaders in Congress, and I'm committed to working with both parties to deliver for our wonderful, wonderful citizens. It's about time. We had a great meeting with Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the whole Republican leadership group. And I'll tell you what, we walked out of there -- Mitch and Paul, and everybody, Kevin -- and we walked out and everybody was happy. Not too happy -- because you can never be too happy -- but they were happy enough. And it was nice to see that happen for a change because that hasn't happened for a long time in this country -- for a very long time.\nI want to take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Texas and Louisiana who have truly suffered through a catastrophic hurricane. (Applause.) One of the worst hurricanes in our country's history. And guess what? We have another one coming. You see that.\nBut our hearts are heavy with sadness for those who have lost everything. They have also filled us with hope because you watched and you witnessed the unyielding strength and resilience of the American spirit. You looked at that in Texas. You looked at Louisiana. You saw the spirit; you saw the spirit of so many other people coming from all over. It was a great thing. I was there twice, and I will tell you the people were absolutely incredible. What they've gone through -- you would not believe this could have happened.\nAnd I know you have a little bit of a drought. They had the opposite. Believe me, you're better off. You are better off. They had the absolute opposite.\nThe compassion of our citizens and the courage of our first responders makes us all very proud to be an American. (Applause.) I can tell you that I was deeply inspired by the faith and perseverance of those who I met and by all of the people that were there -- so many people.\nAnd unfortunately, now we're getting ready to respond to Hurricane Irma. And these incredible people that we have at FEMA and the other groups, they thought they'd get a night of sleep -- one night, just one night. They're not getting anything. They're right now going to Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and they're already there. And they're being hit with some very, very strong and powerful winds. The winds coming now -- Irma, they're saying, is the largest one in recorded history in the Atlantic Ocean -- coming out of the Atlantic, which gets big ones.\nSo I just want to thank everybody and all of the people that are going down. And they're really now, again, in harm's way. We'll work together to help save lives, protect families, and support those in need. Together, we will recover and we will rebuild.\nI also want to tell the people of North Dakota and the Western states who are feeling the pain of the devastating drought that we are with you 100 percent -- 100 percent. (Applause.) And I've been in close touch, numerous times, with our Secretary of Agriculture, who is doing a fantastic job, Sonny Perdue, who has been working with your governor and your delegation to help provide relief. And we're doing everything we can, but you have a pretty serious drought.\nI just said to the governor, I didn't know you had droughts this far north. Guess what? You have them. But we're working hard on it and it'll disappear. It will all go away.\nI want you to know we'll always stand strong and unified with our farmers and our ranchers -- the backbone of America -- that I can tell you, 100 percent. (Applause.)\nSo we're here today to talk about our plan to create a new age of American prosperity by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. The taxes are crazy -- the highest-taxed nation in the world. We're going to turn that around very quickly. (Applause.)\nThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I mean that. I think this is one time you're going to get. And I'm honored to be joined by some of the fantastic leaders who share this goal with us.\nSenator Hoeven. Where is Senator? Senator, stand up, Senator. (Applause.) Doing a fantastic job. Come on up, Senator. Come on up here. Get up here. Fantastic job. Thank you, Senator.\nGovernor Burgum. (Applause.) Come on up, Governor. Beautiful job. Come on.\nLieutenant Governor Sanford. (Applause.) The Governor told me he's the best lieutenant governor in the country. So I don't know. We'll check it out.\nCongressman Cramer. (Applause.)\nSenator Heitkamp. Senator, come on up. (Applause.)\nAnd I have to say, they -- you are all in favor of tax cuts, aren't you? Come on up, Senator. These are great people. They work hard. They're for you 100 percent. And we just want their support because we need support. You see that with what's happening in Congress. Nobody can get anything through Congress. We need support.\nSo thank you, Senator. Senator Heitkamp. Everyone is saying, what's she doing up here? But I'll tell you what -- good woman, and I think we'll have your support. I hope we'll have your support. And thank you very much, Senator. Thank you for coming up. Senators, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)\nThey're all in good company together. By working together, we're going to restore America's competitive edge by passing tax cuts and reform that makes America the best place in the world to hire, invest, and to grow. We love our country, we love our people, and we want to create more jobs in America, for Americans.\nI want to welcome a great friend and a true American visionary who has created thousands of jobs in North Dakota and all around the country, and he's been a friend of mine right from the beginning. He said I should do this; absolutely you have to do it. A great, great American success story -- Harold Hamm. Where is Harold? Where is Harold? Come here, Harold. (Applause.) Thousands and thousands of jobs.\nYou know, Barry Switzer was up at my office. And I never heard this -- you probably have heard this, but Harold was a little bit late and Barry was talking to me. And Barry is a great guy, great football coach. I think he won a Super Bowl and a college number one, right?\nAnd we were talking about Harold, who is a great friend of his. And he said, \"You know that guy, Mr. Trump?\" That was before I was President. He said, \"That guy -- these companies spend billions of dollars and they're looking for oil and they don't find anything. Harold Hamm, he puts a straw in the ground and oil flies out.\" (Laughter.) That's why he's rich, I guess. Anyway, Harold, thank you very much.\nYou want to say something? Go ahead.\nMR. HAMM: You find oil in North Dakota, in the Bakken! (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Harold.\nNorth Dakota is an inspiring example of the amazing things that are possible when we unleash the genius of American innovators, unite the red tape, and I'll tell you -- and we have to unite everything. And all that red tape becomes beautiful when you get rid of it. And we're getting rid of -- are we getting rid of a lot of red tape, by the way? (Applause.) And we unlock the extraordinary potential of our great American workers.\nNorth Dakota chose to embrace American industry and the American worker even when many in Washington wanted to tax and regulate your industries totally out of existence. And you knew that. And you've seen what's happened over the last number of eight months. You've seen what's happened. Big difference.\nToday, families have new jobs and new hope because of the vast energy wealth that you brought to life right here. You understand the vital truth: Washington has no right to shut down energy production because America's energy wealth doesn't belong to the government, it belongs to the people. (Applause.)\nIt belongs to hardworking patriots like you because of the North Dakota energy miracle -- and I call it a miracle. Today, this state has the lowest unemployment rate of any state in America, nearly half the national average. (Applause.)\nI want all of America to be inspired by what's happened in North Dakota and the North Dakota example. This state is a reminder of what can happen when we promote American jobs instead of obstructing American jobs -- which has been happening, believe me. (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, Ivanka Trump -- everybody loves Ivanka. (Applause.) Come up, honey. Should I bring Ivanka up? (Applause.) Come up. Sometimes they'll say, \"You know, he can't be that bad a guy.\" Look at Ivanka. (Laughter.)\nNow, come on up, honey. She's so good. She wanted to make the trip. She said, Dad, can I go with you? She actually said, Daddy, can I go with you? I like that, right? Daddy, can I go with you? I said, yes, you can.\nWhere you going? North Dakota. Said, oh, I like North Dakota. Hi, honey. (Applause.) Say something, baby.\nMS. TRUMP: Hi, North Dakota. (Applause.) We love this state, so it's always a pleasure to be back here. And you treated us very, very well in November and have continued to, so we like sharing the love back. Thank you. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, honey. Thanks, baby. Come. (Applause.)\nAnd she means it, believe me.\nSince my very first day in office, I've moved at record pace -- and really we have gone at a record pace -- to eliminate the barriers that have been holding back our economy. You've seen it -- so many jobs, the stock market is at new highs. We're getting rid of one job-killing regulation after another. We've lifted the restrictions on shale oil. We've lifted those restrictions on energy of all types. We're putting our miners back to work. We've cancelled restrictions on oil and natural gas. We've ended the EPA intrusion into your jobs and into your lives. (Applause.) And we're refocusing the EPA on its core mission: clean air and clean water. (Applause.)\nThat's what I want -- clean air. Think of it. We talk about the -- I want beautiful clean air, and I want crystal-clean water, right? That's what we want.\nIn order to protect American industry and workers, we withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. Job killer. People have no idea. (Applause.) Many people have no idea how bad that was.\nAnd right here in North Dakota, the Dakota Access Pipeline is finally open for business. (Applause.) Now, what other politician, if elected President, would have done that one? They would have stayed so far away. And I did it immediately, and I didn't even do it in that case for jobs. It was the right thing to do. And that is flowing now beautifully. So it was the right thing to do. (Applause.)\nWe opened it despite so many people that were on the other side calling and asking for this not to happen: Please, we don't want it to happen. I said, why? They didn't know. There was no -- they just didn't want it to happen.\nSo I did that. I also did Keystone. You know about Keystone. (Applause.) Another other one, big one -- big. First couple of days in office, those two -- 48,000 jobs. Tremendous thing. I think environmentally better. I really believe that -- environmentally better.\nSo I'm keeping my promises to the American people. I do what's right. That's all. I just do what's right. I don't think about it. I do what's right. (Applause.)\nWe're seeing the results all across the country. Already, unemployment is near a 16-year low. African American unemployment is at its lowest point since almost the turn of the millennium. Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers is at an all-time high. That's something I'm very proud of. And they're moving back. (Applause.) I tell you, the companies are moving back. The car companies are coming back. They're going back into Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and lots of places -- Kentucky. Car companies -- they are moving back. They got to move back, because why should we be allowing other countries to make it -- sell their cars, no cost, just put them right through our borders, cause us unemployment? It's not happening that way, believe.\nAnd it's going to be more and more so, because, you know, like you have to cut through red tape to do things? Hard to believe, I have to cut through red tape to do things too. They have it set. And I'll tell you, America is back -- and it's back right on track, where it should be. And it's happening day after day after day.\nAnd we have certain areas where you have to give notice of 90 days before you can touch an act or before you can touch an executive order. Then you have to wait another 30 days, and then another 90 days. Well, believe me, all of those days are coming up and tremendous numbers of regulations have been cut.\nBut soon, you're going to see even more. And we're going to have regulation because regulation is not bad, but you don't need 25 times what you're supposed to have. So we're going to have sensible regulation. (Applause.)\nBut our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we reform America's outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome -- I mean, this is so complicated and so burdensome -- our tax code.\nOur painful tax system has become a massive barrier to America's economic comeback. It really is; we're penalized. It costs us millions of American jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and on compliance. Our tax code is a giant self-inflicted economic wound.\nIn the last 10 years, our economy has grown at an average of only around 2 percent, and some would say less than that. When I talk to the leaders of other countries -- I speak to them all the time -- they're unhappy about seven or eight points of growth -- GDP. I spoke to a leader of a major, major country recently --big, big, country -- they say our country is very big, it's hard to grow. Well, believe me, this country is very big.\n\"How are you doing,\" I said. Because I have very good relationships -- believe it or not -- with the leaders of these countries. I said, \"How are you doing?\" He said, \"Not good. Not good at all. Our GDP is 7 percent.\" I say, \"7 percent.\" Then I speak to another one, \"How are you doing?\" \"Not good. Not good. Our GDP is only 9 percent.\"\nOur -- if you look at our number when we first got in, we were hitting one-percent numbers and nobody even talks about it. Well, last quarter, we hit 3 percent GDP. (Applause.) And I'll tell you what, a lot of that had to do with the cutting of the regulation, and I think a lot of it had to do with optimism. There's a lot of optimism now. People are starting business that they had no idea they were going to start a year ago.\nIf we sustain 3 percent growth instead of 2 percent -- only one point; and I think we have a long way to grow; I know we have a long way to grow -- that means 12 -- think of it, one point -- 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion of new economic activity over the next decade. Think of it -- $10 trillion. (Applause.)\nAnd if we ever went to 4 percent, think of that, or 5 percent, or 6 percent -- let's see what happens. They were all sort of smiling when I said 3 percent. I must say, we came -- we hit the number faster than I thought, but we hit 3 percent last quarter.\nIf we want to renew our prosperity, restore our opportunity, and reestablish our economic dominance -- which is what we should be doing -- when we need tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, pro-American. (Applause.) And anybody that is going to vote against tax cuts and tax reforms -- whether it's in North Dakota or anybody else, or anyplace else -- you got to vote against them and get them out of office because it is so bad. (Applause.) This is not a close one.\nMy administration is working with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, lower taxes for businesses of all sizes and middle-class families all across the nation. So it's not only business taxes, it's middle-income families, it's families at every level -- every level, tax cuts.\nOur tax plan represents a sharp reversal from the failed policy of the past. America's high tax rates punish companies for doing business in America and encourages them to move to other countries. That's why you see in so many states, including here for a period of time -- now people are starting to stay and companies are staying -- they'd leave for Mexico and for other places, just routinely.\nWell, we've stopped it and we are stopping it. We're not going to let it happen. There has to be a price to pay when that happens; when they let our people go and that happens, and they think they can sell the product right back into the USA. There is going to be a big price to pay, and there has been, and that's why you're seeing a big change.\nThese Washington policies have pushed industries and companies offshore, who then import their goods back into America and lay off their workers in the process. We end up with nothing. Not going to happen.\nMy administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we've embraced a new model -- it's called the American model. Very simple: The American model. (Applause.)\nUnder the American model, we're reducing the burdens of our businesses -- as long as they do business in our country. We want them to do business -- made in the USA -- we want them to do business in our country. We want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and towns. That is how we will all succeed and grow together -- as one team, one people, and one American family. It's love. One American family. (Applause.)\nWe're going to go get into great detail over the next two weeks, but we're working on it with Congress now, and coming up with very exacting numbers. But here are my four basic principles for tax reform:\nFirst, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand -- unlike what we have. (Applause.) Our tax code has gotten ridiculously complex. This complexity leads to massive frustration, wasted time, and wasted money. Lots of wasted money.\nToday, the average taxpayer has to wade through 241 pages of instructions to file a basic tax form. Does anyone know that? Two hundred and forty-one pages. A staggering 94 percent of the families need professional help to do their taxes -- they have to get it -- which is why the tax preparation industry generated $10 billion in revenues last year. That's one business I want to drive down. Sorry. (Laughter and applause.) H&R Block will not be supporting Donald Trump, I can tell you. (Laughter.)\nTaxpayers spend 6 billion hours each year complying with the tax code. That's why we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. Under our plan, 95 percent of Americans will be able to file their tax returns on a single page without having to keep receipts, fill out schedules, or track endless paperwork. We're giving hardworking Americans their time back, and we're giving them their money back. (Applause.)\nSecond, we will cut taxes for middle-class families. This is a major, major tax cut -- the biggest since Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) The pipefitters and plumbers, and nurses, and police officers -- all the people like you who pour their hearts into every penny earned in both the offices and oilfields of America -- you're the ones who carry this nation on your back, and it's time for you to get the relief that you deserve. It's enough. It's enough. (Applause.)\nThat's why our tax plan will reduce taxes for our middle class, and allow them to keep more of their own money -- keep that hard-earned money where you can spend it the way you want to spend it, or guess what? You can also save it. Nothing wrong with that. But it's your money, not the government's money. (Applause.)\nSo we will provide tax relief to middle-income families through a combination of benefits, such as raising their standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit, and lowering tax rates substantially. (Applause.)\nThird, we need a tax code that restores our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Our plan will provide tax relief to businesses of all sizes. And we will cut the business tax rate as much as possible. Ideally, we would like to bring our business tax rate down to around 15 percent. That's a tremendous drop. (Applause.)\nAll told, it will be the greatest tax reduction in the history of our country. Greater than ever before. So that's going to be something. You'll see a rocket ship. You will see something happen like you've never seen.\nBut we'll also dramatically reduce the tax rate for America's small businesses which have created more than 60 percent of new private-sector jobs in the recent past. Tax relief is on the way for millions of sole proprietors, LLCs, and partnerships who report their income to their personal -- and they do this -- they put it on their personal tax returns. People think of it as a business, but it's on their personal tax returns. Those people, with those businesses, will be tremendous beneficiaries. (Applause.) Sounds like many of you have those businesses.\nTax reform will also benefit mid-sized businesses, like North Dakota Guaranty and Title Company in Mandan. You know that company, anybody? (Applause.) President Nick Hacker -- where's Nick Hacker? Hello, Nick. How are you, Nick? How's business? All right? Getting better all the time.\nHe says that he spends a fortune on accountants to navigate our complicated tax system. We know the feeling; everybody here knows the feeling. Like millions of other American businesses, he would much rather spend that money on higher wages for his 140 employees.\nWorkers in the energy sector -- thank you. You have a lot of friends here, Nick. (Laughter.) The workers in the energy sector will benefit enormously as well. North Dakota State Senator Jessica Unruh -- where's Jessica? Where's Jessica? (Applause.) Hello, Jessica. Congratulations. Doing a good job, right? That's what I hear -- who is also an environmental specialist says lower business taxes will be a catalyst for energy companies to hire countless of new American workers. So important.\nWe'll also protect small businesses and family farmers here in North Dakota and across the country by ending the death tax. (Applause.) Tremendous burden for the family farmer. Tremendous burden.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Donald Trump!\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, appreciate it. But a tremendous burden for small businesses and businesses that aren't necessarily liquid, but they're great businesses -- where you're forced to sell and terrible things happen.\nHere with us today is Julie Ellingson, a fourth-generation cattle rancher and a mother of five from Bismarck. Where is Julie? Hello, Julie. (Applause.)\nLike many family ranchers, Julie worries about the death tax shutting down her family business and keeping her from passing it on to her children. It's a devastating tax. Julie: We are not going to allow the death tax or the inheritance tax or the whatever-you-want-to-call-it to crush the American Dream. Not going to let it happen, so -- fighting hard. (Applause.) Thank you, Julie.\nRonald Reagan proved that cutting taxes on American businesses helps American workers win in the world marketplace. When President Reagan lowered taxes, American businesses beat out our foreign competition. Our economy boomed, the middle class thrived, and median family income increased.\nBut then Washington stood by while other countries adopted our playbook. But they did it even better than us. They lowered their tax rates and reformed their tax systems to be more competitive substantially than that of the United States of America. And America went from leading the pack to following way behind.\nNow our business tax rate is the highest in the developed world -- 60 percent higher than our foreign competitors. Pretty bad. Puts us at a big disadvantage. We're behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Japan, Ireland, Mexico, behind South Korea. We're dead last.\nOur high business tax is nothing more than a crushing tax on every product made in America. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. But we're not surrendering any more. (Applause.)\nWe're going to reduce the tax rate on American business so they can keep our jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America, meaning higher wages and greater profits for companies. (Applause.) It's finally time to give the American worker a pay raise. That's what we're going to do. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, we must bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas and just can't come back. Our tax system penalizes companies that bring wealth they have earned overseas back to America. As a result, corporations have parked trillions of dollars in foreign countries -- money that could be and should be brought back into the United States where it can be invested in America companies, in American jobs, and American workers.\nOur tax plan will give these companies a chance to bring back these funds -- and bring them back and spend it in cities and towns all across our country. The numbers you're talking about are staggering. (Applause.)\nThe numbers we're talking about are probably between $3.5 trillion and $5 trillion that cannot come back into our -- and think of it, the Democrats want it to come back. The Republicans want it to come back. They have for years, and nothing gets done. We're going to get it done. (Applause.)\nWe're going to be switching from a worldwide tax system that encourages companies to keep their funds offshore to a territorial system that encourages companies to bring their profits back home to America where that money belongs. It is our time to invest in our country. We want to build our communities, and we want to build beautiful new ones. And we want to rebuild the old ones. And we want to hire -- and you may have heard the term once or twice before -- the fact is we want to -- just like that beautiful man's hat -- we want to make America great again. Good hat. (Applause.)\nThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America's competitive edge. History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome and unstoppable than the will of the American people. You saw that on November 8th. Believe me, you saw that on November 8th. (Applause.)\nIf you demand it, and if you call up people in Congress -- good people, sometimes maybe not the right intention, but good people -- Congress will deliver on it because they have no choice. So you have to call your congressmen. You have to call your senators. You have to make sure that they do what they have to do. And believe me, we haven't given up on healthcare. We haven't given up on healthcare. We never give up. (Applause.)\nOne vote. One vote. Think of it -- one vote. Terrible. A terrible situation took place that night. We can't let that happen again. We cannot let that happen again. But we'll get it done one way or the other. But only if you demand it, only if you, the American people, tell Congress to stop putting party first and start putting America first. Only then will it happen. (Applause.)\nYou can remind them that both of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic Speaker, and a vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota. So it can happen. (Applause.)\nYou listening, Heidi? Yes, Heidi is listening. Yeah, she heard that. Thank you, Heidi. We're not going to put her on the spot. I'm not putting her on the spot. (Laughter.)\nIf Democrats don't want to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, raise your pay, and help America win, voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America, or find a new job. Do something else. Just do something else. (Applause.)\nI'm asking all Americans -- Republican, Democrat, and independent -- to join with me, with each other, to demand tax cuts and tax reform that will put America first. We're going to put America first. It's time. (Applause.)\nWe no longer have to accept a tax code that lets special interests win at the expense of the middle class. We no longer have to accept a rigged system -- you know all about rigged systems; we talked about that plenty of times in the campaign. You think anything is so different? But we're going to make it different. We're going to get that straightened out too -- that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas, and punishes them for investing in America. They actually get punished under the tax code for investing in our country.\nIt's going to all change. We can heal this self-inflicted wound and we can reestablish our economic dominance all over the world. We can give our workers the level playing field they deserve, and they will win. Because if the fight is fair, no one on Earth can beat the American worker or the American company -- nobody, nobody. (Applause.)\nWhen we do, store shelves all across the country -- those shelves, they're going to be so packed -- all around the world will be lined once again with products proudly bearing the words: Made in the USA.\nSo do you remember, when we were growing up, it was either \"Made in America\" or \"Made in the USA\"? What do you like better? Ready? \"Made in America.\" \"Made in the USA.\" What do you like? (Applause.)\nYou like \"Made in the USA\"? (Applause.) Seems to be. We should pick one or the other, probably. (Laughter.) But we want to have one or the other. I think \"Made in the USA,\" right? \"Made in the USA.\" (Applause.)\nThere was such pride in that label, such incredible pride. And it's coming back again. Believe me, it's coming, because the quality of what we do is second to none.\nIf America comes together, if the people speak with one voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across our great land, we will bring back the American Dream. Bring it back.\nI want to thank the people of North Dakota who have been so incredible to me. I have so many friends here. I have so many people that I respect from this incredible state. I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless the American worker, and God bless the United States of America. And I appreciate you being out here today. (Applause.) Thank you.

McCain, R-AZ)\nThe Administration appreciates the continued work by the Senate Armed Services Committee (Committee) on behalf of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 1519, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.\nThe bill supports key Administration priorities including ending the defense sequester, rebuilding our military readiness, and modernizing our Armed Forces for the future. It authorizes funding for our ongoing efforts to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to deter potential adversaries, and to bolster our allies. The bill also includes substantial reforms to Department of Defense (DOD) management and business practices, and the Administration looks forward to working with the Committee to continue finding efficiencies at DOD. In particular, the Administration is fully committed to DOD's full financial statement audit efforts starting in FY 2018 and shares the Committee's goal of achieving a positive audit opinion over time. The Administration will work closely with the Committee on language that facilitates this effort. The Administration also appreciates the bill's inclusion of the 2010 Compact Review Agreement with Palau and its related authorities.\nThe bill authorizes $692.1 billion in total discretionary funding for FY 2018, consisting of $631.9 billion of base national defense funding ($36.7 billion above the President's FY 2018 Budget request) and $60.2 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding ($4.4 billion below the President's FY 2018 Budget request). The previous Administration enacted harmful cuts to defense spending, and this Administration strongly supports eliminating them. To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration looks forward to enacting reductions to non-defense spending, including those proposed in its FY18 Budget.\nWhile the bill contains many promising reforms, it prohibits a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, which would produce substantial recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force structure.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex and working with the Congress to address its concerns about the bill provisions regarding classified programs.\nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure Round: The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges Congress to provide BRAC authorization, as requested, so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting resources on unneeded infrastructure. The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save an additional $2 billion or more annually, resources which could be devoted to higher priorities such as readiness and modernization.\nMixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility as directed in section 3112. While the Administration appreciates the waiver authority to terminate the MOX project provided to the Secretary of Energy, the project is unaffordable and risky. The most recent estimates, produced by the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers, project $12 billion in remaining costs and total construction costs of $17 billion. In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two decades. The alternative, known as dilute and dispose, is a proven approach that is significantly less risky and expensive, and it can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach.\nTRICARE Benefit Reform: The Administration appreciates the Committee's inclusion of meaningful TRICARE benefit reform proposals reflected in sections 706 and 707. Section 706 institutes reasonable pharmacy co-pays that will retain TRICARE as one of the most generous health benefits available while also making it sustainable in the long term. Section 707 eliminates confusion and reduces administrative costs by creating one generous, consistent health benefit that is equal for all members while making special accommodations for the most vulnerable populations, including medically retired members and their families and survivors of those who died on active duty.\nAuthority to Provide Assistance to Counter ISIS and to the Vetted Syrian Opposition: The Administration appreciates the expanded authority in sections 1231 and 1232 for small-scale construction of temporary facilities to meet operational needs and force protection requirements in both Iraq and Syria. The Administration objects, however, to language in section 1232 that requires the Secretary to provide a 30-day notice to Congress on new initiatives. This provision will hamper DOD's ability to respond rapidly to opportunities on the battlefield.\nModification of the President's Authority to Determine Alternative Pay Adjustment in Annual Basic Pay of Members of the Uniformed Services: The Administration strongly objects to section 604, which would place restrictions on the President's authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed services. This change would place more restrictions on the President's ability to set pay for members of the uniformed services than for the Federal workforce. Being able to adjust military compensation nimbly in response to serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare is not only essential to the Administration's responsibility to recruit and retain a ready and capable uniformed services, but it is also required to balance military compensation costs against other investments critical to readiness, equipment, and modernization.\nProvisions on the Organization and Structure of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD): The Administration is concerned with sections 901, 902, 910, and 921, which would significantly reorganize DOD and its components. In order to address those concerns, DOD hopes to work collaboratively with the Committee to better understand the justifications for these provisions. In their current form, these sections seem to hinder DOD's ability to stabilize its senior leadership team and manage the functions and capabilities needed to plan, execute, and oversee national security policies, capability development, and operations. Sections 901 and 902 would alter DOD's planning and would require adjustments before DOD is able to implement changes enacted last year. The Administration is also concerned with the creation of additional Executive Schedule Level II positions in OSD. This reporting structure could complicate the relationship between the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Defense. In addition, section 921 would eliminate each of the military department Assistant Secretaries charged with real property, installation, and facility management. Eliminating these three Assistant Secretary positions would jeopardize each military department Secretary's ability to comply with his or her title 10 responsibilities.\nPersonnel Limitations: The Administration strongly objects to section 912, which would modify the definition of personnel in section 143(b) of title 10, United States Code, by adding the contractor personnel counts against the statutory limitation of 3,767 for military, Government civilian, and detailed personnel in OSD and the OSD direct support activities of the Washington Headquarters Services. Management of the contractor personnel counts in OSD has been addressed through the funding ceiling imposed on all departmental headquarters by section 346(b). The Administration also strongly objects to section 931, which would further increase the Senior Executive Service (SES) reduction set forth in the FY 2017 NDAA by an additional 10 percent, because it would be detrimental to the overall DOD mission and, especially, the SES workforce. Requiring the Department to arbitrarily cut additional SES positions across-theboard would have long-term negative effects or likely effects for various DOD services and organizations. Any further reductions to SES positions in DOD should be made in a deliberate manner following a review and analysis of the impact of such reductions on the functioning of each component or agency.\nAdjustment to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) of Certain Members of the Uniformed Services: The Administration objects to section 603, which would make a military member who is married to another military member ineligible for a BAH at the \"with dependents\" rate. This section would inappropriately penalize military families in which both spouses have chosen to serve their country and, by providing a lesser compensation package than other members of equal grade, send a clear message that their service is not valued as highly.\nAviation Bonuses: The Administration strongly objects to sections 616 and 617, which would eliminate DOD's current flexibilities and impair DOD's ability to manage the payment of aviation bonuses for well-established reasons. Sections 616 and 617 would harm DOD's ability to respond to current heavy recruiting by the civilian airline industry from the military pilot community and would hamper DOD's ability to appropriately manage bonuses and to differentiate bonus levels for enlisted members who pilot remotely piloted aircraft.\nModification of Cost Limitation Baseline for CVN-78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program: The Administration strongly objects to section 125, which would limit the procurement cost for aircraft carriers after CVN-79 to $12 billion. The Administration shares the Committee's concern with the cost of the CVN-78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program and CVN-80 and beyond. The Navy's estimate for CVN-80, however, is $12.6 billion, not including class spares, which is approximately $900 million lower than CVN-79 in constant dollars. Reducing procurement cost for CVN-80 and follow-on ships to $12 billion cannot be achieved without a fundamental change in acquisition strategy (such as multi-year procurement or block-buy contracts that leverage economies of scale) and continuous construction efficiencies, along with significant design modifications that will reduce ship capability. Stability in ship design and funding is the most effective way to achieve significant cost reductions.\nDischarge in the Selected Reserve of the Commissioned Service Obligation of Military Service Academy Graduates who Participate in Professional Athletics: The Administration strongly objects to section 543, which would allow newly commissioned officers graduating from the military service academies, who obtain employment as professional athletes, to forego any active duty service and immediately serve in the Selected Reserve until the completion of their commissioned service obligation. The military service academies exist to develop future officers who enhance the readiness and lethality of the military services. Following graduation from a military service academy, individuals should serve as full-fledged military officers, carrying out the normal work and career expectations of an officer who has received the extraordinary benefits of a taxpayer-funded military academy education.\nTransfer of Lead of Guam Oversight Council (GOC) from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy: The Administration strongly objects to section 951, which would transfer lead of the GOC from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy. The GOC oversees more than just Navy and Marine Corps activities and, when led by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, is able to balance international commitments against various Service considerations in developing policy direction. In addition to the realignment of Marine forces from Okinawa to Guam, the GOC is monitoring U.S. Pacific Command's Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training proposal to develop live-fire ranges and training areas in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (the CNMI) (Tinian and Pagan), and U.S. Air Force Divert and Exercise Airfield for up to 12 tankers on the CNMI. The interagency coordination necessary to complete required environmental analyses for these complex initiatives is most effectively accomplished with direct oversight by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\nWorkforce Issues for Relocation of Marines to Guam: The Administration appreciates the inclusion of section 1264, which would authorize the admission before December 31, 2023, of H-2B workers coming to Guam to perform certain military-related work under modified admission requirements. The Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt the Administration's request, which would address specified needs in both Guam and the CNMI. The Department of the Navy's current workload projections indicate that approximately 2,300 H-2B workers would be required to supplement the Guam or CNMI workforce on military buildup construction projects. Without additional H-2B workers, limited access to construction workers would harm our ability to relocate Marines to Guam on planned timelines. This could be a factor in meeting the commitment of the United States to return land to Japan.\nPolicy of the United States on Cyberspace, Cybersecurity, and Cyberwarfare: The Administration strongly objects to section 1621, which would establish United States policy for deterring and responding to cyber-attacks or other malicious cyber-activities against United States interests. This section would enact certain foreign policy and military determinations that are traditionally within the purview of the President. Development of such policy decisions must necessarily take into account changing circumstances on a more rapid timeline than the proposed legislative process would allow. In particular, section 1621(f) would require the United States to notify and encourage the governments of countries whose computer networks are being used by malicious cyber actors to take action themselves to eliminate the threat, to the greatest extent practicable. This would severely constrain the President's decision space and undermine the ability of the Armed Forces to act rapidly and decisively, in accordance with applicable law, to neutralize threats and to defend United States national interests in cyberspace.\nReductions to Army Networking Programs: The Administration strongly objects to the severe funding reductions in sections 4101and 4201, and prohibitive language in sections 112 and 234, which would affect the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Distributed Common Ground System-Army, and Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense programs. These limitations would cripple the Army's efforts to provide commanders with a unified communications network while working on a solution to fill a critical capability gap regarding on-the-move communications. These constraints also would hamper the ability to provide reliable intelligence analysis down to the battalion level and to ensure that integrated sensors and weapons support current and future Air and Missile Defense systems. At this stage of development, limitations of this magnitude would delay delivery of critical capabilities to our soldiers by at least two years.\nDevelopment of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Range Ground-Launched Missile System: The Administration objects to section 1635, which would establish a program of record to develop a road-mobile, ground-launched missile system and would prohibit any authorization of funds for research and development until a detailed analysis of systems is delivered to defense committees. The Administration is currently developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy to maximize pressure on Russia. It is also evaluating those military capabilities that are needed to protect our national security. This provision unhelpfully ties the Administration to a specific type of missile system and funding requirements, which would limit potential military response options. The Administration would support broad authorization of research and development on missile systems, including those prohibited by the treaty, to determine candidate systems that could become programs of record.\nCounter Unmanned Aerial Systems: The Administration is disappointed that its proposal on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is not included in the bill. For multiple economic and national security reasons, the Administration supports the safe and secure integration of UAS into the national airspace, but that requires the development of a legal framework that protects the public from those who would misuse this technology, such as recklessly flying near major airports, intentionally conducting surveillance, or facilitating attacks. Under current law, the Government is unable to fully evaluate or use essential detection, tracking, and mitigation technologies to counter these rapidly advancing threats. The proposal would provide a tailored grant of authority within a framework for effective oversight and protections of privacy, civil liberties, and airspace safety.\nNext National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) West (N2W) Campus: The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's decision to reduce N2W by $331 million through an incremental funding approach and recommends that funding be provided at the President's FY 2018 Budget request level. The Administration objects to this type of incremental funding for military construction projects because it undermines program stability and cost discipline and could negatively impact other mission-critical priorities. In the case of this project, the NGA expects to obligate the full amount of the budget request in FY 2018.\nNavy Shipbuilding: The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for Navy shipbuilding; the Administration, however, objects to the authorization of funding for only one Littoral Combat Ship, one fewer than the Administration requested, as well as the authorization of partial funding for an additional amphibious ship LX(R). In addition, the Administration strongly objects to section 124, which provides permanent incremental funding authority for the procurement of the LX(R) ship class or the amphibious transport dock ship (LPD-30) class. Incremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.\nMissile Defense: The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for missile defense; the Administration, however, regards section 1653 as premature given that the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) is still underway. The provision would require the Secretary of Defense to deploy up to 14 additional ground-based interceptors (GBIs), store up to 14 GBIs, and complete any required supporting construction at Fort Greely, Alaska, no later than December 31, 2021. After the BMDR is completed, the Administration will provide recommendations on how best to strengthen our Nation's missile defense.\nExercise on Assessing Cybersecurity Support to Election Systems of States: The Administration strongly objects to section 1630, which would require DOD to exercise for a mission inconsistent with its statutory authority, as well as with democratic norms on the role of the military in American political affairs. The Department of Homeland Security is the Federal lead for critical infrastructure, including electoral infrastructure. In addition, section 1630 would direct the Secretary of Defense to intrude on the authority of State Governors to determine how to use their own State National Guard forces to carry out a State cybersecurity mission to protect State election systems.\nTRICARE Advantage Demonstration Program: The Administration objects to section 701, which would require the Secretary of Defense to establish a demonstration program to contract with and automatically enroll TRICARE beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans. Automatic enrollment of beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and TRICARE into a Medicare Advantage plan is undesirable and unworkable. In addition, there is existing demonstration project authority under both Medicare and TRICARE to evaluate any appropriate collaborative initiatives.\nForeign Military Sales: The Administration objects to section 1283, which would require the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to consult with United States commercial entities before delivering a formal pricing and availability response to a foreign customer. Section 1283 would significantly delay responses to a partner's request for price and availability data, and also could result in the United States not being able to respond in time for an international competition. Mandating such procedures would be inconsistent with existing federal procurement rules, could negatively affect open competition in the acquisition process, and slow it to the point of resulting in loss of sales.\nSpecial Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF): The Administration appreciates the Committee's willingness to revise changes made to the SDAF in the FY 2017 NDAA. The Administration objects, however, to section 1281 because it would preclude using available funding in the SDAF account to purchase defense articles and services other than precision guided munitions. The SDAF is a revolving fund and the available funding obligational authority amount fluctuates throughout the year. By mandating that 20 percent of the available obligation authority be used to purchase precision guided munitions every year, the Administration will not have sufficient funding available to purchase any other defense articles or services that will likely be urgently needed by our friends and allies, including those participating in coalition operations that directly support our national interests. SDAF is an important security cooperation authority, as it makes the United States more responsive to the military needs of our international partners, and enhances readiness of our Armed Forces by reducing the need to divert assets from them to support urgent foreign requirements.\nDefense Export Licensing: The Administration supports the goals in section 867 to use flexible comprehensive defense export authorizations, including for large international cooperation defense programs, but emphasizes that the Secretary of State already has the authority to undertake this effort. Since enactment of the Arms Exports Control Act (AECA) in 1976, the Secretary of State has had exclusive responsibility for defense sales and defense exports, including defense export licensing. Over the years, the State Department has always worked closely with its key partner agency, DOD, on these issues. Therefore, no additional authority is needed, and such authority could cause confusion. Should this section be retained, the authority should be vested in the Secretary of State so as to minimize overlapping, duplicative statutory authorities and frameworks. Further, the Administration objects to the mandate in subsection (b), since the longstanding practice is to permit industry to select which of the available licensing authorizations it wishes to use, and restricting this practice would likely create unnecessary regulatory burdens.\nDOD Support for Corporate Activities and Charitable Organizations: The Administration recognizes the value of United States charitable organizations and notes the existing mechanisms through which DOD supports State and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-led reconstruction, development, and stabilization efforts globally, including foreign disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. The Administration has not, however, assessed whether support to a particular organization, as outlined in section 1083, may be undertaken consistent with any other relevant law concerning the provision of non-reimbursable assistance such as military personnel and the use of DOD facilities and other assets by such organizations. The Administration is also concerned about the implications of having a private entity receive preferential support from DOD in security cooperation or operational efforts. Such preferential treatment would cause confusion among existing networks of non-governmental organizations supported by State and USAID in these programmatic areas regarding the recognized need for maintaining a distinction between military and civilian missions, actors, and activities in providing humanitarian assistance. The Administration also believes that section 1082, which facilitates foreign assistance, should be subject to foreign policy direction of the Secretary of State, with input from USAID. Section 1083 also appears premature, insofar as section 1082 directs the DOD to review its collaboration with charitable organizations. Therefore, the Administration objects to section 1083 pending further interagency coordination and internal DOD analysis.\nDefense Industrial Base: The Administration strongly objects to section 863, which would sunset certain procurement requirements related to sourcing goods exclusively from the national technology and industrial base. The existing procurement requirements act as a key guarantor of strategic supply chain security. They protect DOD's ability to reliably source goods such as chemical weapons antidotes and components for naval vessels, among others.\nExpanding Competition: The Administration objects to the breadth of section 811, which would grant waiver authority to the Secretary of Defense in expanding competition for DOD contracts where there is only one responsible bidder. In cases where only one bidder exists, DOD already possesses the necessary capabilities to ensure proper quality and quantity of procured goods, as well as the reasonableness of prices. This waiver authority, if used to override current Buy American laws, would result in further losses of existing American capabilities and jeopardize American jobs. To avoid unintended consequences, the Administration urges Congress to narrow the authority by authorizing its exercise only on a case-by-case basis approved by the Secretary and by exempting certain laws from waiver, including, at a minimum, those that impose domestic source restrictions.\nSimplified Acquisition Threshold: The Administration supports the increase in the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) that would be provided by section 812, but objects to expansion of the waiver to the Berry Amendment and Specialty Metals requirements whose thresholds are tied to the SAT and would automatically increase if the SAT is raised. These provisions provide vital protections for American manufacturing and American jobs. For this reason, the Administration urges Congress to maintain the current threshold for applicability of the Berry Amendment and Specialty Metals requirements. This would enable agencies and contractors to enjoy the benefits of simpler and less costly transactions made possible by an increase in the SAT without erosion of critical domestic source protections.\nWearable Electronics: The Administration objects to section 817, which would repeal domestic source restrictions related to wearable electronics. The Berry Amendment has protected American manufacturing and American jobs since its enactment in 1941. Wearable electronics are an emerging industry in the United States, and this legislation should not hamstring American capabilities in this young field by allowing it to be opened up for foreign bidding. The section also should provide a definition of \"wearable electronics.\" Congress should also consider whether less intrusive means, such as the availability subsection already encompassed in subsection (c) of the Berry Amendment, are sufficient for the acquisition of wearable electronics.\nBerry Amendment Exceptions: The Administration objects to section 865, which would create exceptions to the Berry Amendment under memoranda of agreement with foreign governments. Opening up the end-item market to foreign competitors could collapse upstream industries in the United States such as weaving, cloth-making, cotton growing, sheep herding, and many others. It is important to defend the Berry Amendment, which supports American jobs and protects American supply chains.\nCivilian Workforce Provisions: The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not include the Administration's proposals to provide for key workforce flexibilities to improve, expand, and harmonize the Federal Government's efforts to restructure and reshape the Federal workforce. Many of the proposals enacted in the FY 2017 NDAA, and the Administration's proposals seek to expand those flexibilities across the Federal Government so that the benefits and impacts of the flexibilities they provide can be used across the Federal civilian workforce. The proposals aim to improve the speed and precision with which the Government can hire temporary, term, and student employees; expand access to qualified talent; improve the attractiveness and utility of buyouts as a workforce reshaping tool; and allow for a broader exchange of ideas and talent between the Government and the private sector through industry exchange authority. We highly encourage Congress to include the Administration's five proposals because all Federal agencies would greatly benefit from these workforce flexibilities as they seek to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability to the American taxpayer.\nProcurement Standardization: The Administration urges inclusion of the Administration's proposals to expand to civilian agencies the procurement provisions applied to DOD by the last Congress to standardize basic acquisition procedures and flexibilities across the Federal Government. Consistent treatment of issues, including task order protests and use of purchase cards, will reduce unintended costs and complications associated with bifurcated acquisition processes.\nConstitutional Concerns: Certain provisions in this bill raise constitutional concerns. These include, for example, section 1242, which would interfere with the President's exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations; section 1265 and 1653, which would interfere with the President's authority to command the armed forces; and section 1241, which would interfere with the President's authorities to conduct diplomacy and command the armed forces. Section 901(e) would contravene the Appointments Clause by authorizing an incumbent official to serve in a new office without further appointment.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.", "timestamp": "2017-09-07", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 1519 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128277", "text": "North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum: \"North Dakota leaders have worked hard over the past 25 years to reduce individual and corporate income tax rates, pass sensible regulations and foster a business-friendly environment that stimulates investment and job creation, and we appreciate President Trump recognizing those continuing efforts. We share the president's goals for tax reform: simplify the tax code, lower rates to ease the burden on middle-class families and set corporate tax rates at levels that allow U.S. businesses to better compete in the global economy, bringing back jobs and wealth from overseas. And we urge Congress to work with the administration to achieve meaningful tax reform that encourages economic growth and saves taxpayers time and money.\"\nSenator John Hoeven (R-ND): \"We appreciate the president and members of his cabinet coming to North Dakota to discuss the importance of reforming the tax code for families and businesses across our state and nation. Today's speech highlighted North Dakota's role in powering our nation's economy and how tax reform will empower greater economic growth, job creation and help to increase wages for our workers, while also providing tax relief for individuals and families across the country. We need to get tax reform done for the American people.\"\nSenator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND): \"Every day in the U.S. Senate I wake up thinking about how I can fight better and harder for rural America – and as the heartbeat of rural communities, North Dakota workers must be at the forefront of any tax reform bill. When a sitting president visits North Dakota, that's a welcome opportunity for our state and a chance for us to highlight North Dakota's priorities. It was good for our state that President Trump came to Mandan today to hear those priorities firsthand. When I look to the future of North Dakota's economy, I think about the working families like mine in small, rural towns like Mantador where I grew up. Those working families and enterprising young kids need policies that encourage them to innovate, build, and grow businesses and jobs that our communities can take pride in and rely on. For families like mine who wear their blue collar roots proudly, we know these are the issues that can make all the difference for the folks who shower after work, for the businesses that need certainty to create good-paying jobs, and for middle-income families so they aren't saddled with more debt than they can handle. That's why I'm committed to fixing our broken tax code, and making sure it encourages workers, their families, and our businesses. Today President Trump spoke about his priorities for tax reform, and it's encouraging he committed to promoting American workers as key to any tax reform policy. But, as North Dakota's former Tax Commissioner, I know the devil is in the details of any reform plan as tax codes are complex, and we need to know what those details are. I've long said that I'm open to working with Republicans and Democrats on comprehensive, permanent tax reform that promotes North Dakotans during their working years as well as protects their dignity in their retirement, and I intend to keep working with both sides of the aisle to see if we can come up with a tax reform plan that works for North Dakota workers and retirees.\"\nRep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND): \"Tax reform is the single most important policy change we can make in this country to increase wages, boost economic growth, and make America the place for businesses to create jobs again. Failing to implement meaningful tax reform would be a failure to the American people and we must act now. It's no surprise President Trump used North Dakota as his backdrop for discussing the restoration of America's competitive edge through tax reform. With the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, North Dakota is the role model for what can happen when our government focuses on promoting job growth and reducing complex regulations that harm businesses. I'm honored to attend this event today with President Trump and look forward to getting tax reform done.\"\nSenator David Perdue (R-GA): \"President Trump is right that a top priority when it comes to fixing our tax system is to make American businesses more competitive with the rest of the world. We've got to lower our corporate tax rate. We also have several trillion dollars stuck overseas in U.S. profits because of our repatriation tax. Getting rid of that archaic tax in its entirety and lowering our corporate tax rate will put U.S. companies back on a level playing field. President Trump has my full support as he continues to make America more competitive and simplify our tax system for everyone.\"\nGreater North Dakota Chamber: \"The GNDC has long advocated for a tax, legal, and regulatory environment that allows businesses to thrive. In recent years, the GNDC has worked with state legislators and the administration to champion common sense tax policies that fosters, rather than stifles, economic growth. Our collective efforts and subsequent success in this regard have helped provide North Dakota with a critical competitive advantage. There is no question the current federal tax system is broken. The GNDC welcomes President Trump to our state as he campaigns for comprehensive tax reform and we are delighted to have a president who is making this policy initiative a central priority. While we are well aware that tax reform is a complicated and time-consuming process, we are of the strong opinion that there can be no turning back. Businesses and individual taxpayers deserve a federal tax system anchored in the principles of common sense and simplicity which will help ensure prosperity for all. Furthermore, if we can get real tax reform done, American business will be more globally competitive. We thank President Trump for his leadership and we urge the members of North Dakota's congressional delegation to work in a bipartisan fashion to make federal tax reform a reality.\"\nNorth Dakota Farm Bureau: \"NDFB is pleased to be a part of President Trump's visit to our state. The new administration has been a blessing to North Dakota's agriculture community, showing strong leadership by rejecting what the courts had set aside in the ill-advised Waters of the U.S. interpretation of the Clean Water Act. NDFB looks forward to President Trump's leadership on a variety of other priority issues for rural America, such as comprehensive tax reform. President Trump has made it clear he supports needed changes in the tax code. We are hopeful the administration and the American people can force action, particularly from Senate Leadership. Legitimate tax reform, which is good for main street rather than Wall Street, is a long time Farm Bureau priority and NDFB is excited to encourage the President in his efforts. We have the opportunity for real, lasting changes in many segments of the economy that impact agriculture — energy, taxes, EPA and regulatory reform, and trade. NDFB is supportive of the Trump administration as they make changes demanded by the voters in 2016, and we are eager to help the President fulfill his campaign promises.\"\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry: \"The Trump administration is committed to revitalizing the American economy and creating jobs, especially in the energy sector. Through a vigorous and fair tax reform that puts the American people first, we will unburden the economic constraints facing industry and unleash the power of American energy.\"\nSmall Business Administration Administrator Linda McMahon: \"I am very happy to see President Trump visiting North Dakota to speak on tax reform. The current tax system is a huge burden to Americans and directly impacts the success and advancement of our nation's small businesses. We will see a dramatic growth in the economy if we can lower our tax rate and simplify the tax code. More than 98% of businesses in North Dakota are small businesses! By cutting taxes, we are putting more money directly into the pockets of the hard-working American entrepreneur. Consistently, as I travel around the country meeting small business owners, they tell me that they will reinvest in their companies and hire more people if they can get a more favorable tax rate. We are looking for aggressive reductions and I have the utmost confidence in President Trump that he will not settle for anything less than that.\"\nTreasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin: \"President Trump made a forceful case for comprehensive tax reform to level the playing field for American job creators and spur economic growth that will yield millions of new jobs. Middle-income families in North Dakota and across the country deserve a tax cut, and the President is committed to simplifying the tax code to put more money in their pockets. During today's visit, the President put a personal face on the harmful impact the \"death tax\" has on farmers and ranchers in North Dakota. I look forward to working with Congress to provide relief from this and other onerous taxes, jumpstart our economy, increase wages, and create more opportunity for Americans.\"\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt: \"President Trump reminds Americans what we can accomplish when we work together. At EPA, we strive to protect human health and the environment, while also providing regulatory certainty in a way that allows businesses to innovate and grow.\"\nSecretary of Agriculture Perdue: \"Farming is a complicated operation, so to place more burdens on the people of agriculture through the tax code has never made any sense. Most agricultural enterprises are small businesses, and the costs and time required simply to comply with the tax code are impediments to what these folks really ought to be doing, and that's growing and producing food to feed the United States and the world. It's an old, not-so-funny joke that farmers live poor and die rich, because of the value of the land they own. It isn't right that a family's hard work will be punished by the Death Tax, through which many farms have to be broken up or sold off just to pay the tax bill. I urge Congress to take up the tax reform agenda to give American agriculture the best chance to succeed. That would be in line with our new motto here at USDA – 'Do right and feed everyone.'\"\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke: \"I applaud President Donald J. Trump's ambitious and determined work to deliver tax reform to America's energy workers. High taxes and over-regulation have discouraged development of our natural resources and job creation on federal lands for too long. Energy-rich states like North Dakota have proven the economic benefits that go hand-in-hand with harnessing these energy resources - including the over 5 million acres of federal mineral estate managed by the Department. North Dakota is the second highest producer of oil behind Texas - it is an energy powerhouse that will help lead our country to energy dominance. As global competition for investment increases and other countries seek to attract investment to their shores, we need to be ever vigilant that the United States maintains its competitive edge. The market for reliable and affordable energy is strong, but right now our high tax rate and over-regulation punishes companies for doing business in the U.S. Tax reform will restore our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for American energy workers on federal lands and waters, and it will help put us on track toward American Energy Dominance. Developing American energy and achieving American energy dominance has three major benefits to the environment, economy, and national security: First, it's better for the environment that the U.S. produces energy. I've spent a lot of time as a Navy SEAL in the Middle East, and I can tell you with 100 percent certainty it is better to develop our energy here under reasonable regulations rather than have it produced overseas with little or no regulation. Second, energy production is a boon to the economy, supporting more than 9.8 million jobs and supplying affordable power for homes, hospitals, manufacturing, and transportation. But for too many local communities, energy on public lands has been more of a missed opportunity and has failed to include local consultation and partnership. And, lastly, achieving American energy independence will strengthen our national security by reducing our reliance on foreign oil and allowing us to assist our allies. As a military commander, I saw how the power of the American economy and American energy defeated our adversaries around the world. Under President Trump's leadership, we will once again develop our resources and use them as a diplomatic force to keep prices low and Americans safe.\"\nSmall Business & Entrepreneurship Council President & CEO Karen Kerrigan: \"Small businesses are grateful that President Trump is using the bully pulpit to fuel momentum for tax reform. Entrepreneurs and small businesses need a tax system that supports their growth, encourages investment and capital formation, and allows them to operate competitively in the global economy. That means having access to more of their hard-earned profits to reinvest back into their businesses, employees and local communities. The economy will more grow more quickly, and Americans will have greater opportunities. A vibrant and growing economy will also fuel the confidence and resources that people need to take the risk of starting a business. With 3.4 million missing businesses in our economy, tax reform is a key policy solution that will encourage more entrepreneurship in America. Furthermore, encouraging all businesses to do more business in the U.S. and bring their profits back home means small business suppliers have expanded opportunities to grow their revenues and increase wages for their employees. It is very positive to see Senator Heidi Heitkamp alongside President Trump in support of tax reform. There is broad support across America for tax reform and Senator Heitkamp's colleagues need to follow her example and work across the aisle to find common ground. SBE Council and its members look forward to working with members of Congress from both political parties who want to provide entrepreneurs, small businesses and their employees with a simplified tax system that eases their burdens, and provides the tax relief they need and deserve.\"\nRATE Coalition: \"We are encouraged by the continued unity from leaders in the Administration and in Congress around the need to fix America's broken tax code. Today's meeting marks an important step towards fulfilling a critical goal to \"lower rates for all American businesses so they can compete with foreign ones. As President Trump noted in his remarks last week, \"we have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries\" with a corporate tax rate that is the highest in the industrialized world. Employing over thirty million Americans – one-third of America's private-sector workers across all fifty states – the RATE Coalition and our 33 members certainly understand the costly consequences of surrendering that competitive edge. More importantly, however, we also stand eager to assist President Trump, his Administration, and leaders in Congress to reduce the rate to a globally-competitive level. While much attention has been focused on a meeting at the White House regarding the tax rate, it is our hope that much consideration will also be given to meetings that are taking place across America because of the tax rate – from a Fortune 500 Company deciding to relocate overseas to a small business owner contemplating how to comply with a complex code. With a corporate tax rate that is a full 15 points higher than the OECD average, our government isn't just collecting taxes – it's also constricting businesses. The RATE Coalition applauds the 'Big Six' for recognizing the severity of that problem and urges them to utilize this once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix it.\"\nNorth Dakota Petroleum Council: \"The NDPC and its members support and welcome the President's commitment to pro-growth tax reform, an effort that is long overdue. For more than three decades, businesses and hard-working Americans have been overburdened by a complicated and bloated tax system that seems to punish rather than encourage success and reinvestment in our country. Today, we are excited that our government is taking steps toward comprehensive reform that will bring jobs and wealth back to the American economy. There is perhaps no better example of what a pro-growth tax plan can do for our economy than right here in North Dakota. Certainly, our state has been blessed with rich natural resources, but being able to harness those resources is what has set us apart from other energy-rich states. For the past decade, North Dakota has been a step ahead thanks to its efforts to enact an all-of-the-above energy policy, create a pro-growth business climate and encourage investments in the technologies that have since unlocked our energy resources. This has forever changed the way we develop our energy and helped reverse our dependence on foreign oil. Today we stand on the verge of energy independence, and domestic energy production has neutralized OPEC's control on our energy markets. Yet, to continue our progress, we must ensure that our country can continue to compete. The President's administration has made tremendous strides in helping alleviate many of the duplicative and burdensome regulations that have been obstructing continued investment by the industry. President Trump's commitment today to reform our tax code will boost our ability to further invest in our domestic resources, make both the U.S. and North Dakota more competitive, and benefit the more than 72,000 North Dakota workers whose jobs are supported by the industry, all while keeping energy affordable for all Americans. As this plan unfolds, we look forward to lending our guidance and support for a more simplified tax structure that will encourage job and business growth and put more money back in the pockets of hard-working families.\"\nLignite Energy Council: \"On behalf of the members of the Lignite Energy Council (LEC), I'd like to welcome President Donald Trump to Bismarck. President Trump knows that homegrown North Dakota energy like oil, gas, and lignite coal help drive the American economy. We are encouraged to hear the President's willingness to reform the tax system. The LEC will continue to advocate for tax policy like the 45Q: tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration.\"\nFreedom Partners Spokesman Bill Riggs: \"We continue to be encouraged to see the administration and Congress pushing ahead on bold tax reform that both restores fairness and provides real relief. The way to do that is by eliminating as many special-interest carve outs and loopholes as possible and lowering rates as low as they can go. The political favoritism and corporate welfare rampant throughout the tax code has been undermining fairness and eroding trust for years. Tax reform is Washington's best opportunity to un-rig this broken system, bring jobs and investment back to America, and level the playing field so Americans can compete and win. Delivering a tax code that is simple, fair, and lets Americans keep more of their hard-earned money shouldn't be a partisan issue. We urge Democrats and Republicans to work with the Trump administration to make this a reality.\"", "timestamp": "2017-09-07", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: Praise for President Donald J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128284", "text": "PRESIDENT TRUMP: Good afternoon, and thank you for all being here. It's my great honor to welcome His Highness the Emir of Kuwait to the White House.\nThe United States and Kuwait share a strong and enduring partnership. We recently commenced [commemorated] the 27th day of remembrance of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, which we all remember so well. The United States is proud to have contributed to the liberation of Kuwait and for the friendship we have built together in the years since.\nToday, we reaffirm our commitment to our shared security interests and recognize Kuwait's critical contributions to regional stability. We also thank Kuwait for its humanitarian leadership and for its partnership in the fight to destroy ISIS.\nDuring my trip to Saudi Arabia, I spoke to the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations about the need to confront our shared enemies -- murderous terror groups that threaten all civilized people. Every responsible nation must work together to strip these groups of their territory, their financing, and the false allure of their evil ideology.\nI applaud Kuwait for its role in this effort and encourage all nations in the region to do their fair share in defeating those who wage war on the innocent. Each nation in the region must decide what kind of future they want for their own children: one of violence or one of peace. That also means confronting those, such as the Iranian regime, who support terror groups and radical militias.\nCooperation between America and Kuwait has never been stronger -- never, ever. The FBI and the Kuwaiti government are expanding our counterterrorism and intelligence-sharing efforts. We are making progress on promoting Kuwaiti investments in the United States. They're making tremendous investments in our country. They have great confidence in our country. We're also entering a bilateral agreement with Kuwait regarding customs enforcement.\nDuring the same period, and the same trip to Saudi Arabia -- which was my great honor representing our incredible country -- His Highness personally asked me to expedite a $5 billion agreement for the sale of American F/A-18 Super Hornet fighting jets for Kuwait. I am pleased to report that the State Department has now authorized this transferred purchase, which will not only strengthen our mutual security, but will greatly benefit American workers.\nKuwaiti's investments in America through its sovereign wealth fund are profitable for Kuwaiti people and they create many, many jobs in the American workforce. I am pleased to report this year that Kuwait has taken delivery of 10 American-made Boeing 777 airliners. They're beauties. American workers build the best planes in the world, by far, and we want them to be made available for those countries that want them. And Kuwait has been a big buyer of commercial airliners made by Boeing and others.\nOur partnership extends beyond shared economic and security interests. We're signing a memorandum to deepen the close educational ties between our two countries, enhancing English language, and that's what we're going to be doing -- we're enhancing the whole relationship through the use of the English language. And that is something that's very exciting, I think, for both of us.\nI want to thank His Highness for his leadership role and the role he's playing to help the nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council follow through on their pledges from all over -- because we went to Saudi Arabia, and the pledges of ending terrorist financing came from every country in that magnificent room, on that magnificent day. And we are addressing the ongoing GCC dispute, and the Emir is leading those discussions and hopefully it will be resolved very soon.\nWe call on our GCC and Egyptian allies to focus on our commitments at that Saudi Arabia summit to continue our joint efforts to drive out and defeat terrorists. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt are all essential U.S. partners in this effort. We have great relationships with all of them right now; maybe better than we've ever had. We will be most successful with a united GCC.\nTomorrow, Secretary of State Tillerson and Foreign Minister Al-Sabah will chair the second U.S.-Kuwaiti Strategic Dialogue. By strengthening communications with allies like Kuwait, we send a strong message to both terrorist organizations and regional aggressors that they cannot win -- they will not win; they cannot win against us; and our military is getting stronger and stronger and stronger -- and that those who cherish and value human life will always prevail.\nI want to thank His Highness for joining us here today. The United States values its close friendship with Kuwait and its people, and we look forward to strengthening these bonds even further. Together, we will show the world that the forces of destruction and extremism are no match for the blessings of prosperity and peace.\nThank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nEMIR Al-SABAH: (As interpreted.) My dear President, Mr. President Donald Trump, Your Excellencies and Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted, and my delegation, to be here today in Washington, this great city, in response to the invitation that His Excellency, my friend President Trump, has extended to me.\nI would like at the outset to reaffirm and resend once again our condolences to the President and the American people about the victims of Harvey Hurricane that hit Texas. And we are deeply affected by the human losses and the huge destruction in public facilities and property.\nI pray to God almighty that he would make this, the coming hurricane that is about to hit Florida -- for it to be a harbinger of goodness, not evil. I wish and hope that the losses would not be harmful to the American people and would not cause further sadness and grief for those who will fall victim to this hurricane.\nOnce again, we reaffirm that we stand by our friends in the U.S. in fighting and confronting this issue. We have had deep and comprehensive discussions that reflect the depth of our bilateral and historic relationship, and advanced relationships in all levels -- at the political, economic, and military, and security levels -- in order to serve the mutual interests of our two countries and people.\nI here would like to commend the commitment that we have sensed here on the part of the U.S. about the security of the State of Kuwait. And within the framework of these relations, we remember with great gratitude the great role that the U.S. played when it assumed the leadership of the international coalition that liberated my country from the throes of the invading Iraqi forces and restored its freedom. And this memory will remain forever in the minds of the Kuwaiti people.\nWe also highly value the strategic relations between our two countries. We have discussed the situation in the country, foremost among which is the unfortunate dispute between our brothers in the Gulf region and our efforts to contain it, and the international support that we have received for these efforts.\nWe have also discussed our common efforts, in cooperation with the international community, in fighting terrorism and ending the sources of funding for it. And in this regard, I would like to commend the prominent role that the United States plays in combatting terrorism, especially the recent victories against terrorism. And we have also discussed the situation in Iraq, and the catastrophic situation in Syria, and Yemen, and Syria, and Libya. And we affirm the need to end their fighting there through dialogue between the various disputing parties.\nAnd we have affirmed the necessity of the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility in maintaining international peace and stability, because the continuation of those struggles continues to be a threat.\nWith respect to the Palestinian question, we have praised the recent U.S. efforts to move the peace process, and we affirmed the need to join efforts in order to reach a comprehensive and lasting solution to this problem on the basis of a two-state solution and in accordance with the international legitimacy resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative.\nOnce again, I thank His Excellency, the President, for his kind invitation to us and for his kind hospitality. And we look forward to meeting with His Excellency, the President, in the State of Kuwait within the framework of our efforts to further enhance our relations and build on our strategic relationship in the service of the interests of both countries and people.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: All right, we'll take a couple of questions. Go ahead. Yes.\nActually, we'll go to somebody else this time, John. (Laughter.) You've been doing enough, John. Go ahead, CBS.\nQ: Thanks. Mr. President, on the question of North Korea, the country feels that a crisis is coming. Some lawmakers, Lindsey Graham among them, have almost described the situation as inevitably leading to war. I don't want to ask you if you think it's inevitable. What I do want to ask you is, as President of the United States, would you tolerate a nuclearized North Korea that is contained and deterred but still nuclear? Or would it have to abandon nuclear weapons? And would military action on the part of the United States be one of the options necessary to achieve that goal?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable. It would be great if something else could be worked out. We would have to look at all of the details, all of the facts. But we've had Presidents for 25 years now -- they've been talking, talking, talking -- and the day after an agreement is reached, new work begins in North Korea, continuation on nuclear.\nSo I would prefer not going the route of the military, but it's something certainly that could happen. Our military has never been stronger. We are in a position now -- and you know the new orders. You see the new numbers just like I see the new numbers. It's been tens of billions of dollars more in investment. And each day new equipment is delivered -- new and beautiful equipment, the best in the world, the best anywhere in the world, by far.\nHopefully we're not going to have to use it on North Korea. If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.\nDo you have a question for the Emir?\nQ: Follow-up: Is it acceptable for you, as President, for North Korea to be nuclearized but contained and deterred? Is that a strategy you would like --\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: We're going to see what it is. I don't negotiate with you --\nQ: -- to prefer?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I'm not negotiating with you. Maybe we'll have a chance to negotiate with somebody else, but I don't put my negotiations on the table. Unlike past administrations, I don't talk about them. But I can tell you that North Korea is behaving badly, and it's got to stop.\nOkay, a question for the Emir?\nQ: Your Excellency, you mentioned in a general sense the situation with Qatar. How optimistic are you about it being resolved, and what role would you like the President of the United States to play in achieving a resolution?\nEMIR AL-SABAH: (As interpreted.) We hope -- we still have hope that the dispute will be resolved between Qatar and its neighborly countries in the GCC. Especially that our friends in the U.S. and our other friends are assisting us in resolving this issue, I am optimistic that the solution will come in the very near future, God willing.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Question for the -- yes, for the Emir first, yes.\nQ: My question is for you, Mr. President, first. Kuwait News Agency.\n(As interpreted.) Do you support the Kuwaiti mediation role between Qatar and the four countries? And do you support the holding of a conference that will include all parties in Kuwait? Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: While I do appreciate and respect the mediation, I would be willing to be the mediator. I was telling the Emir before that if I can help between UAE and Saudi Arabia, where I have a very great relationship -- I spoke with the King yesterday, King Salman, who is a friend of mine, and we spoke on unrelated subjects, but we had a long conversation. If I can help mediate between Qatar and, in particular, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, I would be willing to do so. And I think you'd have a deal worked out very quickly.\nI think it's something that's going to get solved fairly easily. Kuwait has been really the leader of getting it solved, and we appreciate that very much. But I do believe that we'll solve it. If we don't solve it, I will be a mediator right here in the White House. We'll come together. Very quickly, I think, we'll have something solved.\nQ: (As interpreted.) Emir, in light of the regional conditions in the region, has there been an assertion on the role of the U.S.'s commitment to the security of the State of Kuwait? Thank you.\nEMIR AL-SABAH: (As interpreted.) Thank you. And you have heard now what His Excellency, the President, has said about the relations between Kuwait and the U.S., and its assertion of its commitment to the security of Kuwait. And this is not something new.\nAnd don't forget that the United States has managed with its other allies when Kuwait was occupied; it liberated Kuwait from Iraq within a few months. And this is something that the Kuwaiti people remember very well and everybody also. And we here thank the United States and the American people for that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Go ahead.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Nadia Bilbassy with Al Arabiya Television. You dispatched a team to Israel and Palestine, and you're about to meet the leaders of both countries in the U.N. soon. Do we expect a new American initiative to move the process forward?\nAnd if I may, sir, the U.N. has just published a report about Syria's Assad regime using chemical weapons. They said they basically used it more than two dozen times. Does that mean that President Assad is immune now from any prosecution? And what can you do to stop the further use of chemical weapons? Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, first of all, the Palestinians and the Israelis -- we are discussing, we are working. They say it is the world's most complex and difficult deal. You know that. But it is something that could happen. I believe that the relationships that we have with both can help. It's an event that's just never taken place. Sometimes people think they're close and it never happens, or it never happens successfully.\nI think we have a chance of doing it. I think the Palestinians would like to see it happen. I think the Israelis would like to see it happen. And usually when you have two groups that would like to see something happen, good things can happen.\nSo I think there is a chance that there could be peace. But again, I say that a little bit reluctantly. We're going to give it our best. We have tremendous talent working on that particular transaction. As you know, David Friedman, the ambassador, is very much involved. We have a great group of people. We'll see what happens.\nAs far as the chemical weapons, I find it hard to believe that after what we did the last time, that Assad would do that again. I haven't heard what you just said, but I find that a little bit difficult to believe. But nothing would change. We would be extremely upset if he was using chemical weapons.\nAs far as Syria is concerned, we have very little to do with Syria other than killing ISIS. What we do is we kill ISIS. And we have succeeded in that respect. We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS. So ISIS is rapidly disappearing, as you know, and that's because of our great military. The military has been absolutely incredible in terms of what they've done with ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.\nDo you have a question for the Emir?\nQ: (As interpreted.) Yes. To the Emir, all the parties are holding onto their own positions with respect to Qatar. Where do you see a breakthrough in this dispute? Do you see any indications to make us believe that this crisis will come to an end?\nEMIR AL-SABAH: (As interpreted.) The hope has not ended yet. I would like to affirm that Qatar is ready to meet all the demands that were put -- the 13 demands that were presented, and is ready to sit at the table to negotiate and to discuss with us all everything related to the dispute between the parties -- the Gulf parties.\nAs you know, we have 13 demands that were presented, and we know that not all of these 13 demands are acceptable. But if we were to sit down together and discuss these 13 demands -- and we have indeed accepted them, and Qatar has accepted them -- we would be able to resolve all 13 demands -- all the issues and points that harm and relate to the dispute between the countries of the region and anything that harms the interests of our other friends.\nThank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: This all began because of the fact that there has been massive funding of terrorism by certain countries. And what I want is I want to stop the funding of terrorism, and we're going to stop the funding of terrorism. And if they don't stop the funding of terrorism, I don't want them to come together. But I think they will.\nYou have a question?\nQ: (As interpreted.) Your Highness, Said Saeed (ph) from Al Jazeera, Mr. President. We talk about Kuwaiti mediation and supporting Kuwaiti mediation. Are the talks and the meeting that happened in Kuwait, which received U.S. and international support -- is there, in reality, something clear and a breakthrough that has been accomplished in this crisis? Are we about to see at the beginning of a breakthrough? Or, Your Highness, are the things -- issues so complicated? We talked about a deep discussion about all the issues. What is the real issue and complicated issue at the heart of this dispute? We would like to find some information -- where is the problem here -- so that we can solve it. Thank you.\nEMIR AL-SABAH: (As interpreted.) First of all, I would like to say, there is no problem that cannot be resolved. True, it's complicated, but when we meet around one table -- and now we have an affirmation from the country to which some demands were presented by its brotherly nations in the Gulf region when we hear that it's ready to discuss all these demands. We are not among those countries, but we are guarantors, and we can guarantee that we will pressure Qatar because it's not in the interest of Qatar to remain outside the flock. Rather, it should join its brothers in the GCC.\nAs you know, thank God, the wisdom of our brothers in the Gulf region -- they should appreciate the situation we are in today -- the situation in Syria and Iraq, and in Syria and in Libya. Now is the time that we have to forget all these differences. It's true we have descended into some not very healthy issues, especially in the media, but in spite of all of that, we were one of the most people to be affected by this situation by what our brothers in Qatar have done.\nBut when that happened, and before this dispute came into existence, we met with our brothers in Qatar and put an end to this issue. And this is now a normal issue. We met in Riyadh, in the presence of President Trump, and there was no one to say that there was a dispute between us. But suddenly, this dispute came into existence. Thank God, now, what is important is that we have stopped any military action.\nAnd these disputes, as I said, they are complicated. And we have seen the media campaign that is totally unacceptable to the people because the media coming out of this country is against the people, not the rulers. And for that reasons, we have received from Qatar a letter in response to the letter I sent them, and they are willing to sit down at the table and discuss all these demands, which the other parties have put down.\nAnd we're talking about 13 demands, and I'm certain that all these certain demands, some of them -- a great part of them will be resolved and the other part -- and perhaps, we might not accept them because anything that effects sovereignty we would not accept.\nBut we are very hopeful. We have great hope in our friends in the U.S. that they will assist them to restore things to where they used to be.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, that is a problem that we will get resolved, and I'm very, very honored and happy to know that you have problems with the media also. (Laughter.)\nThank you everybody. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-09-07", "title": "The President's News Conference with Emir Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah of Kuwait"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128211", "text": "My fellow Americans,\nAs Hurricane Irma approaches, my Administration is working closely with our state and local partners to help save lives, protect families, and assist those in need. This is a storm of absolutely historic destructive potential. I ask everyone in the storm's path to be vigilant, and to heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement. Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our people. We are doing everything we can to help with disaster preparations and, when the time comes, we will restore, recover, and rebuild – together, as Americans. In times such as these, we see the strength and the resolve of the American Spirit – and we see the kindness and courage of our people. With gratitude for our first responders, and prayers for those in the storm's path, America stands united – and I mean totally united. From Texas to Louisiana, from Florida to Puerto Rico, and always the US Virgin Islands, and everywhere in between that has been affected by these terrible storms: we will endure and come back stronger than ever before.\nEarlier this week, I visited the hardworking citizens of North Dakota to promote our vision for tax cuts and tax reform that will create opportunity and prosperity for millions and millions of Americans. As President, I am committed to pursuing an economic policy that lifts up all of our citizens, provides hope for all of our communities, and generates wealth for everyday hardworking people and it's about time.\nSince January, we've already created 1.2 million jobs. Unemployment is near a 16-year low. Wages are rising. But for our economy to truly take off like it should, we must cut taxes and reform our badly-broken tax system.\nOur current burdensome tax code is a massive lead weight against the American economy. It costs us millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance.\nMy Administration is working closely with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for businesses of all sizes and most importantly for Middle Class families all across America.\nFirst, we are going to make filing taxes as simple as possible. If you're like most Americans, under our plan you will file your taxes on a single page. What a difference that will make – and you won't need to keep endless receipts and paperwork. We are freeing you from the horrible tax maze.\nSecondly, we will cut taxes for Middle Class families. We want you to keep more of your hard earned money. This way, you could spend it, you could save it, you could do whatever you want.\nThird, we will restore our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for the American worker.\nToday we have the highest business tax rate anywhere in the developed world – 60 percent higher on average than our major foreign competitors. It is a crushing tax on every product Made in America, and it encourages American businesses to ship jobs and factories overseas – something that I have been fighting long and hard and we are making tremendous head way. Believe me, they are starting to move back to our country and the jobs are coming with them.\nWe are going to cut taxes on American Industry so we can create more business in our country. We want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and towns.\nFinally, we will make it easier for companies to bring back trillions of dollars that they are now keeping overseas. And the reason is the tax is too high and the bureaucracy is too great. It is so complicated for them to bring back their money that they say \"let's just leave it over here, we won't bring it back to the United States.\" Terrible situation. We are going to take care of it. But this money should be brought back to American soil, where it can be invested in new factories and brand new beautiful jobs.\nOur plan is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-American.\nThis is our chance to give American workers a level playing field, to end the rigged system that lets special interests win at the expense of the middle class, and to reestablish our economic dominance for generations to come.\nThat is how we all succeed and grow together - as one team, one people, and one American family. Frankly, that is how we Make America Great Again.\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-09-08", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

As we reflect on our sorrow and our grief, we come together to pray for those who lost loved ones. As a Nation, we pray that the love of God and the comfort of knowing that those who perished are forever remembered brings them peace and gives them courage.\nWe pause to remember that tragic morning, when our homeland endured unprecedented attacks. As we watched smoke billow from the World Trade Center, we prayed for the safety of our fellow Americans, and we reached out to help, however we could. Now, during these days of prayer and remembrance, we remind ourselves of the lives -- mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters -- lost at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, and aboard United Flight 93 when it crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. We also honor the brave first responders who rushed into crumbling buildings, risking their own lives to rescue others. More than 400 first responders lost their lives in those efforts, so that others would not perish.\nToday, a single tree stands near the base of what was once the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, having survived that fateful day 16 years ago. This tree, the \"Survivor Tree,\" stands as a living testament to our national character of triumph. Like the Survivor Tree, we continue to stand tall and strong as one Nation.

As we reflect on our sorrow and our grief, we come together to pray for those who lost loved ones. As a Nation, we pray that the love of God and the comfort of knowing that those who perished are forever remembered brings them peace and gives them courage.\nWe pause to remember that tragic morning, when our homeland endured unprecedented attacks. As we watched smoke billow from the World Trade Center, we prayed for the safety of our fellow Americans, and we reached out to help, however we could. Now, during these days of prayer and remembrance, we remind ourselves of the lives -- mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters -- lost at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, and aboard United Flight 93 when it crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. We also honor the brave first responders who rushed into crumbling buildings, risking their own lives to rescue others. More than 400 first responders lost their lives in those efforts, so that others would not perish.\nToday, a single tree stands near the base of what was once the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, having survived that fateful day 16 years ago. This tree, the \"Survivor Tree,\" stands as a living testament to our national character of triumph. Like the Survivor Tree, we continue to stand tall and strong as one Nation. Try as they might, terrorists will never defeat our resilient American spirit.\nWe also pause to pray for those who fight today and every day to protect our country from terrorism.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128215", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nOn Patriot Day, we honor the nearly 3,000 innocent lives taken from us on September 11, 2001, and all of those who so nobly aided their fellow citizens in America's time of need. We rededicate ourselves to the ideals that define our country and unite us as one, as we commemorate all the heroes who lost their lives saving others.\nSeptember 11, 2001, will forever be one of the most tragic days in American history. Through the unimaginable despair, however, ordinary Americans etched into our history remarkable illustrations of bravery, of sacrifice for one another, and of dedication to our shared values. The shock from the indelible images of the smoke rising from the World Trade Center and Pentagon gave way to countless inspiring videos of co-workers helping one another to safety; of heroes running into collapsing buildings to save the innocent people trapped within; and to the unforgettable story of the patriots who charged the cockpit of Flight 93 to save untold numbers of lives. These heroes moved us with their bravery. They make us proud to be Americans.\nThroughout history, everyday Americans and first responders have done the extraordinary through selfless acts of patriotism, compassion, and uncommon courage. Not just in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, but across our great Nation, Americans on September 11, 2001, bound themselves together for the common good, saying with one voice that we will be neither scared nor defeated. The enemy attempted to tear at the fabric of our society by destroying our buildings and murdering our innocent, but our strength has not and will not waiver. Americans today remain steadfast in our commitment to liberty, to human dignity, and to one another.\nIt has been 16 years since the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Children who lost their parents on that day are now parents of their own, while many teenagers currently in high school learn about September 11th only from their history books. Yet all Americans are imbued with the same commitment to cause and love of their fellow citizens as everyone who lived through that dark day. We will never forget. The events of September 11, 2001, did not defeat us. They did not rattle us. They, instead, have rallied us, as leaders of the civilized world, to defeat an evil ideology that preys on innocents and knows nothing but violence and destruction.\nOn this anniversary, I invite all Americans to thank our Nation's incredible service members and first responders, who are on the front lines of our fight against terrorism. We will always remember the sacrifices made in defense of our people, our country, and our freedom. The spirit of service and self-sacrifice that Americans so nobly demonstrated on September 11, 2001, is evident in the incredible response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The same spirit of American patriotism we movingly witnessed on September 11th has filled our hearts as we again see the unflinching courage, compassion, and generosity of Americans for their neighbors and countrymen. The service members and first responders who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and in the years of service since would be proud of what we have all witnessed over these last three weeks and what will undoubtedly unfold in the coming months of recovery. By protecting those in need, by taking part in acts of charity, service, and compassion, and by giving back to our communities and country, we honor those who gave their lives on and after September 11, 2001.\nBy a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as \"Patriot Day.\"\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2017, as Patriot Day. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

The President is constantly monitoring Hurricane Irma, and the federal government is working closely with our state and local partners to ensure the safety of the coastal communities.\nIn his Weekly Address to the nation this morning, the President noted that this is a storm of historic destructive potential, and he's asking that everyone in the storm's path remain vigilant and heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement.\nOur message to the American people is this: With gratitude for our first responders, and prayers for those in the storm's path, we are behind you 100 percent.\nWith that, I'd like to bring up the President's Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, to discuss specifics on the federal government's ongoing preparedness and response efforts.\nAnd after, I'll be up to take further questions. Thanks.\nMR. BOSSERT: Thanks, Sarah. Thanks to each of you for being here. I can't add too much more to that, so let me see if I can just jump in a little bit to my thinking here. As you've heard me say before, I like to try to categorize my thoughts into informing, influencing, and inspiring, if I can.\nIn terms of informing, please recall the process here is that the federal government, under President Trump's leadership and the leadership of his Cabinet, is fully engaged, but they're fully engaged in support of the governors. Those governors at this point are engaged in various different forms and phases of what we consider incident management.\nSo as I walk through Irma, let me stop -- I'd be remiss if I didn't -- and talk about Texas and Harvey.\nSo, Governor Abbott and I have been in close contact and haven't stopped that contact, because his people in Texas and the people of Louisiana, under Governor Edwards, are involved in the early stages of what will be a long recovery effort.\nThe people in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the other Caribbean islands affected by Harvey [Irma] already are in the middle of acute lifesaving and life-sustaining response operations.\nAnd what we're seeing in Florida and South Carolina and Georgia are the final stages of preparation for the beginning of response operations.\nSo we're seeing all three play out for us at the same time. It requires us to juggle some of our thinking, but it doesn't require us to juggle our resources.\nSo, to be clear, the response operations have ceased lifesaving and life-sustaining in Harvey, and we had an opportunity to rest and refit our forces, move them out, and reposition them for Harvey [Irma]. We're right now employing them in the islands to save lives, and we will maintain a good footprint and posture to do the same in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia as the storm progresses.\nSo I'll come back to some of the path and the track and forecast here in a moment. I'd like to see if I could reinforce that by suggesting we take this very seriously. It's not only a dangerous storm; we've already seen loss of life. This storm has taken lives already. It's going to take more, unfortunately, if we're not prepared. So please take it seriously.\nI'd also suggest now, in terms of influencing, that people stop watching so carefully this track, and start thinking a little bit more seriously about getting themselves into a safe place and out of danger. Now, I don't want them to take that as a call for shadow evacuations. Please listen to your local authorities on evacuation orders. They're not only looking out for your best interest, but they're carefully coordinating. This is a peninsula, and so people need to evacuate from south to north, and that is a staggered and carefully thought-through process.\nBut what I am suggesting is, at this point this is a large storm. And whether it wobbles left or wobbles right, you need to at this point start thinking through your own personal accountability. So please make sure -- it's kind of an oxygen mask theory -- take care of yourself first so you can take care of others, take care of your loved ones. And if you're able, please take care of strangers and others in need. I think that's something that we've seen in Texas and I have every reason to believe that the people of Florida and South Carolina will show that same American spirit and value.\nLastly, if I can, there's been a lot of kind of coverage of Florida but not necessarily media coverage of the U.S. Virgin Islands. And if I can, I'll give you a brief update on where we stand there.\nWe are, as I just talked to Department of State and Department of Defense officials, engaging in this lifesaving, life-sustaining operation in the following way: Governor Mapp is experiencing loss of power; loss of water, as a result; loss of communications; and some other sheltering needs. And so what we're doing is sending in air operations and surface operations to evacuate citizens. We're also doing that in St. Martin and St. Maarten, the Dutch-French island that's been reported there are some American citizens there.\nWe are currently in the final stages of operations planning to evacuate those citizens. There are numbers ranging from 350 to 6,000. That was our planning assumption parameter. Those American citizens will be removed via surface and air means. We've had to do some kind of planning adjustment for surf conditions for wind and for Hurricane Jose as we look forward to that hopefully missing the United States. It's unfortunately still causing some havoc in the islands, in our response operations, our evacuation operations.\nSo that's where we stand on that. They'll begin executing those plans, if not already, at some point soon today. And we'll see some of those American citizens and other evacuated as necessary, to include anyone with critical or acute medical needs.\nSo that's where I would stop on the update, and I'll take your questions.\nQ: Tom, one of the big problems with the Florida evacuation is that so many gas stations are running out of gasoline. What, if anything, can the federal government do in the next 24 hours to assist in getting more fuel to the people in Florida?\nMR. BOSSERT: So there's a number of things that we've done. I should stop and mention by name, Governor Scott -- tremendous leadership, tremendous confidence. He and the President have spoken, and I have spoken. I've got every confidence in the governor and his emergency manager. They're demonstrating the same leadership resolve and skill and quality of effort that we saw in Texas a week ago.\nWhat we're seeing in Florida, though, are fuel shortages. We saw those same fuel shortages in Texas because people appropriately gas up their generators, their cars, their boats and so forth.\nSo what we'll see here now is a need to pull in additional fuel, and that need will run up against the onset of tropical storm force winds.\nSo what are we doing? We're bringing in as much supply of refined fuel as possible, and we've waived a particular statute that allows for foreign flag vessels to help in that effort. So it's little technical, but it's called the Jones Act. Some of you have reported on it. What happens is the Secretary of Homeland Security can waive that act. Until that's waived, only U.S. flag vessels can move fuel from point to point, domestically.\nWhat we've done now is we've freed up that prohibition, so now foreign flag vessels -- so as many ships, tanker ships as possible are now being brought to bear on the effort to bring as much fuel as possible and to help Floridians, regardless of their flag vessel status. And that's the best we can do. In addition, they're planning all the intermodal points to get trucks from those tanker ship port locations into the gas stations. So that's what we're doing.\nQ: The window is rapidly closing. How much more can you get in there?\nMR. BOSSERT: The conditions will dictate that. I don't think there will be too much more that we can get in. At some point here they'll have to stop those operations. And again, that's one of my messages here. It's not a tough love message, it's just a message of clarity and honesty.\nAt some point, people are going to be on their own, so to speak, for a period of time during which the flooding, the raining, and the wind bear down on them, and they need to be prepared if they are in that path and haven't taken some action to get themselves in a less dangerous position, to be ready for at least a 72-hour period. That would be my advice for them to have enough food, water, and shelter before the government can get back in.\nWe have pre-deployed and pre-staged, but we can't actually get to that final point of care until conditions permit.\nQ: One housekeeping question. For FEMA to have resources and no broken chain there, the President needs to sign legislation the House just passed this morning. Any indication of when that's going to happen?\nMR. BOSSERT: So I'd like to start by thanking Congress. They came in in a fast way to give us the emergency supplemental funding. I think that's what you're alluding to.\nFirst, FEMA still has the money that they need, so there's no break in operations -- I want to make sure to clarify on your question there -- but there will be a break in their operations if they run out of money. That's why that supplemental legislation was so necessary. Thank you to the House and Senate leadership for bringing everyone back in and passing that so quickly and responsibly.\nWe anticipate, honestly, this is a real-time event. The bill might be on its way up here right now, and requires signature by the Speaker, signature by the Senate leadership or the Vice President, and then a signature by the President of the United States. And so I think that will happen today, but as soon as we get it, the President will take that seriously.\nQ: Talk to us about the complication of a storm track -- and we don't know the wobbling nature of it, but it looks like it's going to cover the entire peninsula, running south to north. How does that complicate emergency management response as it moves up the state? And to Floridians who are veterans of hurricanes, there is sometimes a tendency to say, I can ride this one out, I've seen bad storms before. Could you address both of those?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yes, of course. Some people call it \"hurricane amnesia.\" Let's hope there's no hurricane amnesia, but I would start by saying there are some people -- probably some 20 percent of the population -- that might not remember or might not have gone through the last big hurricane in Florida. It was probably 2004 or 2005, right? There were four major hurricanes in 2004; Wilma in 2005, which was forgotten because of Katrina.\nIf you haven't experienced it, take it seriously and ask those who have. If you have experienced it, please recall that what I just described took place. You were without power, you were without comms, and you were without water, in some cases, or sewer treatment and so forth for a period of time afterwards. So plan for that.\nIn terms of the track, there's three considerations. The upper-right, northeast quadrant of the storm packs the most punch. The second consideration is, if the eyewall gets over land, it tends to lose steam a little faster; so if it stays over water, it tends to keep its strength a little longer. And so as this thing moves left and right, it can affect our operations because it can affect a different part of the state in a different way -- wind or flood.\nWhat we'll see here over the next 24 hours is going to tell us which one we're going to face. We're planning for all those eventualities. I guess maybe worst-case scenario is if it dips down, moves west, and curls around to the other side of the state. Because right now, it's my belief that people haven't been planning for that. I want to make sure -- I'm not suggesting that that's going to happen, but it seems to be within the cone of uncertainty.\nAnd so this storm, at this point, could do everything from Tampa to Jacksonville and a direct hit on Miami. So please plan for those things accordingly. Don't necessarily evacuate based on those eventualities. Listen to your local officials as they're tracking it most closely. But do prepare to be in the storm's path just in case. So that's how we're doing it.\nAnd then lastly, to answer your question, Major, what we're doing is instead of prepositioning all the commodities in places that might be affected by the storm, to continue support operations to the islands. The FEMA logistics team have thought through placing those supplies elsewhere, even up to Delaware and New York and elsewhere, so they continue barge operations and to support the islands, and that the next storm doesn't affect the storm before -- if that answers your question.\nSo I can go here.\nQ: The big question is, after the chemical fire that occurred in Texas, and the fact that you all are being taxed with a second storm, are there any extra precautions that are being taken from this time to ensure that that type of thing doesn't happen here? And how taxed is the system for this and for Jose coming in?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, the system can be taxed in different ways. I addressed already the lifesaving, life-sustaining operational capabilities that we have, all the USAR teams and so forth which are martialed by the federal government but provided by the states. They're all rested and refit and ready to come back into the fight. Same with the Coast Guard and United States Military National Guard and Title 10 forces.\nWe're preparing for environmental losses, as we should. I can't speak to each and every company's preparation efforts. As I stand here, we can continue to monitor that and follow up with you. There will be steps that are taken, from setting down the nuclear power facility to a position of safety. I think they take some kind of warm shutdown posture at some point, depending on the track. So we monitor those things. I was comfortable with the position of most of them. But also look at Okeechobee, because that's going to be a big flooding risk and an overflow risk.\nQ: Is there anything that you're not comfortable with right now that is an overriding concern?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, well, we're worried about the fuel shortages. We're worried about whatever worries the governor at this point. But no, to be honest with you, I am setting expectations appropriately here, because as we go through a storm, nobody is ever happy or completely safe. But I am extremely comfortable with the government efforts. Now I want to make sure that people understand that they have a part to play here as well.\nQ: I have two questions for you if you don't mind. Number one, taking a step back and looking a little more big picture, you've got wildfires out west, you've got the crisis in Texas that people are still recovering from, you have Irma, Jose on its heels. The resources of the federal government are not unlimited. At what point do you worry that the resources are being stretched too thin, if you're not at the point now?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, I don't -- as the Chief of Staff, General Kelly, says, the federal government should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. He's absolutely right. We've had Cabinet meetings here today, yesterday, and throughout these storm events focusing on efforts and national security matters around the globe.\nSo I'm pretty comfortable in our ability and our capacity as leaders, but also as institutions to handle the various different things that come our way. I'm extremely comfortable with President Trump's capacity to do so. He's demonstrated an ability to juggle these issues of complexity on a regular basis, including today.\nWhat I do worry about are the financial resources. Congress came and stepped up in a bipartisan way. I think President Trump deserves a lot of credit for putting that together over the last 48 hours. And they have done what the American people really want them to do, and that is act and do what's right instead of quibbling over things that tend to get in the way of efficient execution of services.\nAnd so in this particular case, we're going to have to go back, I'm sure, for additional resources as these storms continue to hurt our states and our citizens. But for now, we're taking a responsible course of action, asking for the money in the appropriate small tranches, and then reassessing and getting better estimates so that we don't overestimate. But we're not doing it in a way that's going to stop or slow down operations.\nQ: And my second question -- and actually, do you know what a number would be on that yet, or is it too early?\nMR. BOSSERT: On a subsequent request? No, a little too early. So as you know, the approximately $7.5 billion that came for FEMA on the supplemental was a calculated estimate. There's a $6.8 billion figure, roundabout, that would be a regular scheduled replenishment at the end of the month for FEMA's disaster relief fund. Those two together were contemplated. So we assume passage of both. The third, or future, request will be based on estimates of information as we refine them.\nQ: And while we have you here -- I know you're here to focus on Irma, but I've got to ask about DACA because there's still a question of what happens to DACA recipients currently serving in the military. There's still no decision. Can you explain why there's a delay in explaining to these folks what's going to happen and when they might be able to expect an answer?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, I can't. I can tell you that the President put it back on Congress and then asked for his priorities to be met and their solution.\nQ: But in the interim window?\nMR. BOSSERT: In the interim window, I'm not sure, to be honest with you, what the answer is on the military part of DACA. But I thought we were clear. I'll find and make sure I get back to you on that.\nQ: Tom, given Harvey and the flooding and the recovery efforts that you talked about, and then what may happen with Irma, there have been reports that you all are reconsidering the flood -- reversing the floodplain regulations that the Obama administration put in. Can you talk about whether you are, in fact, reconsidering that -- either putting back those regulations or drafting new regulations that would once again toughen back up the flood regulations given that we're going to facing a lot of those issues as both of these places recover?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, no, I won't necessarily accept the premise of the question, but I will answer the spirit of it. So it's not about tough or not tough, it's about smart or not smart. And I think the answer here -- I think I went out and did this in one of your publications -- the answer here is that we shouldn't use federal money to rebuild in ways that don't anticipate future flood risk. So we need to build back smarter and stronger against floodplain concerns when we use federal dollars.\nWhat happened in the President's infrastructure executive order was the rescission of an Obama-era order that had a broad-ranging and overreaching scope into construction permitting. And at the time that we rescinded it, we did so in the hope of expediting infrastructure development in this country, which I think was a smart move, for what it's worth. The President certainly did as well.\nBut now what we have to do is replace with thoughtful -- whether it's an executive order, regulations, or both -- building standards and practices for the expenditure of federal money that makes floodplain and risk-mitigation sense.\nQ: But there will be some kind of affirmative effort to --\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah. In the interim, I should point out two things here, right? Not to be defensive, but first, that Obama-era executive order had not turned into a regulation yet. So nothing in this storm would have changed, whether we acted or didn't act, if that makes sense. So this was not an immediate or poorly thought-through step.\nAnd then secondly, whether we put forward an executive order or not, we do have the latitude, under the current Stafford Act authorities and other laws to put into these rebuilding practices in Texas and Florida appropriate floodplain management practices. But we want to make sure we think through how to codify that for the future in the next month.\nMa'am.\nQ: Tom, on Monday, we're seeing an anniversary -- 9/11 -- and the nation right now is seeing a lot of vulnerabilities, speaking (inaudible). What is the threat level? And what is this administration doing as it relates to moving into this tragic anniversary -- remembering this tragic anniversary?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, I was kind of personally motivated into service on that day. And that's why I've come back to service here again. The counterterrorism mission is the one I take the most seriously. And President Trump will, as Presidents before him and since 9/11, receive a comprehensive picture of the terrorist threat environment and what we're doing to counter it from his senior officials on 9/11 -- or I think on Monday we'll do this; we'll get the timing of that to you and we'll give you a readout.\nHe'll do that; that's a practice that we've started since 9/11. And Presidents Bush and Obama maintained that practice. President Trump intends to do the same. And then I'll let the team announce his planned event for -- or scheduled events for attending any ceremonies and paying some respects. But for the most part, I'd encourage the administration -- who will, I'm sure, fan out and give appropriate speeches -- to show some solemnity that day and not talk too much about policy. It's a day of remembrance and respect.\nQ: What's the threat level right now as we go into 9/11 and with the vulnerabilities that we are seeing throughout this nation?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, no terrorist should view us as vulnerable right now -- farthest thing from the truth, okay? Second, there is no actionable credible threat to the United States right now. We've run those regular risk-posture meetings here at the White House, and we bring together the entirety of the intelligence community when we do so. There is no current, credible, actionable threat -- terrorist threat -- against the homeland. But we will continue to track that, and if we learn of such a thing, we communicate it to our law enforcement authorities and to the public as soon as we learn it.\nQ: In addition to the issue of supplies of oil and gas, there's the issue of price, and gasoline has jacked up about 70 cents a gallon. I remember in an earlier briefing, you said you would be monitoring to make sure there isn't gouging. Are you monitoring beyond the issue of supply and demand? It does seem to be a pretty bad excuse just to raise prices. And to make sure that it's data-based?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, so the idea is trying to determine -- it's a fact-based determination -- the difference between gouging and supply-and-demand price indicators. So I'd ask you to remember one thing: that refineries, at least five or six of them in Houston, are still down. So we've got a refinery issue on one side, and we've got an increased demand issue on the other side. And so that's necessarily, generally, going to raise prices, but it's a short-term price spike in our experience. We'll try to differentiate that from gouging as we examine any potential allegations of that practice.\nBut for right now, Floridians are pretty well used to this, and I think they're pretty well used to their Attorney General prosecuting them in Florida. So I'm not of the opinion that I have to issue too many warnings from this podium again, but in case anybody missed me last time, gouging won't be tolerated, period -- period. Okay?\nLet me see if I can come back real quickly, because I know Sarah is here and has a lot more to do. Governor Mapp, Governor Rosello, Governor McMaster of South Carolina, Scott of Florida, Deal of Georgia, and Abbott or Texas -- you're all on our minds. You're all our clients. You're our customer base right now. You're going to set the requirements, we're going to meet those requirements. And as Americans, we're going to get through this.\nSo remember, I started with inform, influence, and inspire. I'm pretty certain that the country saw the people of Texas show us what compassion is all about, and I'm pretty sure the Floridians and South Carolinians are going to step up and match that challenge in the next coming days. Let's say a little prayer for them, and I'll come back out and speak to you as the situation dictates.\nSo thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, Tom.\nAs you can see, the safety and security of the American people is the President's top priority, and we'll continue to work with our local partners to keep the public fully informed as the events unfold.\nLooking ahead to this weekend, the President and the First Lady will be hosting Cabinet members and their spouses at Camp David. This will be a working weekend, which will include the fourth Cabinet meeting since the President took office. That will take place on Saturday. The President will lead a discussion on the administration's priorities, in addition to receiving briefings on Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts and preparations for Hurricane Irma.\nSecretary Mattis will obviously be among the Cabinet members attending this weekend. And on a lighter note, today happens to be his birthday. So I'd like to wish Secretary Mattis a happy birthday on behalf of all of us here.\nEverybody knows I love a good birthday story. In a letter to his troops in the field in 2003, General Mattis encouraged them to fight with a happy heart and a strong spirit, and to demonstrate to the world that there is no better friend and no worse enemy than a U.S. Marine. I think it's safe to say that he has lived his own life by that advice. And, General, we hope you're 67th birthday is a good one.\nWith that, I'll take your questions. Cecilia.\nQ: Is this agreement with the Democrats that the President reached a one-off? Is this something we can expect to see more of -- bipartisanship from this White House?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly think that the goal is to have bipartisan efforts and certainly legislation where you've got Republicans and Democrats both working towards it. That was something that the President talked about during the campaign, and certainly something that I think the American people expect, and one of the reasons they voted for him. And I certainly would expect to continue to see that.\nQ: Does the President care at all that Republican leadership is annoyed with this deal that he reached?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the President's focus was doing what was best for the American people, and that's why he's the President. The people wanted somebody to be a leader, they wanted somebody that was going to step up and take action and get things done, and that's exactly what the President did.\nI think the last thing we want to do is play partisan politics when we have people in places like Texas and Louisiana that need financial support through the federal government. The President wanted to make sure that happened and that that got taken care, and that's what he did.\nJohn.\nQ: Sarah, what's the thinking behind the President working with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to eliminate the need to constantly go through this debt ceiling process?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that if you can take some of that partisan bickering out of the process, that's probably a good thing. This is a government that is always going to pay its debts and wants to make sure that our bills get paid and that we can support the needs that we have of our country, like we're having to do right now in a time of disaster relief efforts. And so that's certainly a priority moving forward.\nQ: But there's some conservatives in Congress who say taking away the battles over the debt ceiling just means that you're going to continue to add on debt, add on debt, add on debt, with no checks and balances.\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I think that's if you have your priorities wrong. The President is focused on, one, balancing the budget, bringing that debt down overall, but also making sure, again, that the citizens of our country, particularly those in a really desperate time of need, like we are seeing right now in Texas and Louisiana, are taken care of.\nMajor.\nQ: Sarah, about tomorrow -- you said it's important for the public to be fully informed. I would just suggest you take in due seriousness having the pool be able to cover some portion of that Cabinet meeting at Camp David tomorrow so the country can be fully informed.\nMS. SANDERS: We will be releasing some of the President's remarks from tomorrow and we'll keep you guys posted on that process and how that will work.\nQ: In this regard, you talked about eliminating partisan bickering from the debt-ceiling process. Is that a Republican problem?\nMS. SANDERS: Is that a -- I'm sorry?\nQ: A Republican problem. We had 90 Republicans in the House vote against this emergency relief package, in large measure because it was decoupled, or coupled in a way --\nMS. SANDERS: The majority of Republicans voted for it. Again, I think that the most important thing is that the deal got done, the President acted on it, and he worked with Democrats to get it done. And I think he's going to continue to work with whoever is interested in moving the ball forward to help the American people.\nQ: And to Republicans who are displeased with this, what is the White House message then? Just get over it? You're sore losers? What?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the biggest message is that we're a lot less focused on what makes Congress happy, and what makes Americans better and stronger. And that was the decision that the President made -- that this was something that was important to get done, and he was willing to work with Democrats to make sure it happened.\nQ: Sarah, I think you -- just to change subjects for a second. There's been estimates that a quarter-million of Rohingya Muslims have left -- fled from the violence in Burma perpetrated by the military portion of the Burmese government. And I think, last week, you said you would ask whether the President had been briefed, and you weren't sure.\nCan you give us an update as to whether the President has been briefed, made aware of it, if he has concerns about this because it could be regionally destabilizing? And also let us know whether the President, since taking office, has had any direct conversation with Aung San Suu Kyi, and would agree with some members of Congress who are now saying they would like her to take a stronger role in sort of denouncing this violence and trying to put an end to it.\nMS. SANDERS: I know that he's aware of the situation and we're monitoring. I'm not aware of if they've had specific conversations. So I would have to look into that.\nQ: Do they have a statement though, about -- have some concern about this?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're monitoring the situation and I would refer you to the State Department for specific details at this point.\nJeff.\nQ: Sarah, what specifically are some ideas that the President would like to work with Democrats next on? He's talked a lot about tax reform obviously, but is infrastructure also on the list here? Or when we will know if this new approach to bipartisanship is something that is his new plan versus just, as Cecilia asked, a one-off?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President is committed to moving legislation through, he wants Congress to act, and he's happy to have Democrats be part of that. Tax reform is a huge part of the agenda moving into the fall. Infrastructure is something, certainly, we'd love to see. He had meetings on that just yesterday, and we're going to continue to work with anyone willing to sit down at the table and focus on those pieces of legislation.\nQ: Has he given up on healthcare repeal?\nMS. SANDERS: No. And, you know, we're going to continue pushing and looking for new ways to improve the healthcare system. And certainly, the ultimate goal would be to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something that actually works.\nQ: Would he work with Democrats on that to try and find out a solution or a fix?\nMS. SANDERS: If Democrats are willing to work on an actual solution, sure.\nAdam.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. The President, this morning, talked about tax reform in a tweet, and he's focusing the country on tax reform after we get past the hurricanes and the immediate threats. Everyone in the administration says tax reform this year. One person, however -- that would be Leader McConnell -- keeps saying tax reform this Congress, which could be next year. Is the President willing to allow the focus on tax reform to move into 2018? And if not, what would he say to the Leader to get him onboard with everyone else in the administration to deliver tax reform to the American people by December 31st of this year?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the ultimate goal is certainly to get it done. Ideally, we get it done as soon as possible. The most important thing, though, is that we're providing tax relief for middle-class Americans. And so, ideally, we get that done -- if we could get it done tomorrow, I think everybody would be happy with that, but obviously it's going to be a process. As soon as we can, that would be our ultimate goal. But we want to make sure we get it done right. And that's important.\nQ: But Leader McConnell keeps saying \"this Congress\" as if to give them a backdoor excuse or option to go into next year. What does the President say to him about that?\nMS. SANDERS: I can only -- I certainly can't speak for Leader McConnell, but again, this administration -- our priority is to get this done and get it done as quickly as we can.\nCatherine.\nQ: Sarah, is Mar-a-Lago following evacuation orders in\nPalm Beach?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't speak for the Trump Organization. I'd direct you to them.\nQ: And do you know at all if Mar-a-Lago has survived a number of -- come through a number of hurricanes with very minimal damage, would the President consider evacuees or victims of the storm being housed there?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, that's something that you would have to talk to the Trump Organization, not something I can comment.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two for you. One, in regards to the deal reached with Democrats earlier this week, the President talked a lot on the campaign about how he cuts the best deals. What would the White House's message be to Republicans who, on the issue of the debt ceiling or on the CRs of the past, ultimately achieved better deficit deals under President Barack Obama?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that you could say that it's a better deal when you're helping people that are in a recovery effort. And that certainly was the priority of the President -- was making sure that we move things forward and quickly so that those people were taken care of. And that was the priority in that process.\nQ: There was a report earlier this week that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking to meet with or interview White House staff regarding the statement that was put out in early July about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russian (inaudible) and other individuals at Trump Tower. Has a formal request been made? And will White House staff be complying? And who was affected by that request?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm now aware of a specific request at this time, but certainly we've been very clear that the White House will be fully cooperative and transparent through this process.\nNoah.\nQ: Sarah, I have two questions -- one on DACA and one on the debt ceiling deal. On DACA, the President tweeted yesterday that DACA recipients have \"nothing to worry about\" over the next six months, and there would be no action. Can you definitively say that no DACA recipients will be deported in the next six months?\nMS. SANDERS: I would imagine, unless there was there was some sort of criminal activity, I think that would change the situation --\nQ: Why can't you definitively say that no DACA recipient will be deported?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I was about to, if you'd let me finish my sentence. But I was going to say that, outside of circumstances where there may be criminal activity or something along those lines, the President has been clear that that's not something that would take place or change over those six-month period.\nQ: I think what most DACA recipients are worried about is that their status is scheduled to lapse by 2020. Can you speak to that? I mean, when the President says they have nothing to worry about, they're all going to be --\nMS. SANDERS: During this six-month time, there are no changes that are being made to the program at this point. After that -- again, the goal is that Congress makes a permanent fix and that Congress actually does their job, and that we have responsible immigration reform that takes place over these six months, and those individuals won't be affected because they actually stepped up and did what they were asked to do by the American people.\nQ: On the debt ceiling deal -- when it comes to votes, is the President finding Schumer and Pelosi to be more reliable partners in getting votes than the Republican leaders?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President is committed to working with both Republicans and Democrats, and we're going to continue doing that and trying to get the best legislation we can for the American people.\nI hate to do this, but it's Friday and the President is departing, and I know several people have to step out for that. We'll be around the rest of the afternoon. If you guys have follow-up questions, we'll be happy to answer them.\nThanks, guys.\nEND 2:20 P.M.

And as the President has said, I say again, to those affected by Hurricane Irma: We are with you, we will stay with you, and we will be with you every day after this tempest passes -- to restore, recover, and rebuild. (Applause.)\nEveryone remembers where they were on this day 16 years ago -- a mom rousing her children to get ready for school; a farmer wrapping up the morning chores; a coal miner finishing the third shift and heading home. As a new member of Congress, I was going through my normal workday routine at the United States Capitol when I learned of the attacks in New York City and at the Pentagon.\nI will always remember the scenes of that day, watching the Capitol complex being evacuated. It was as though the building was literally hemorrhaging with people running in every direction.\nI found myself just across the street from the U.S. Capitol eventually, on the top floor of the headquarters of the Capitol Police Chief. I was there with leaders of the House and Senate.\nShortly I arrived, the chief of police set the phone back down and informed the leaders gathered there that there was a plane inbound to the Capitol, and he said it was \"12 minutes out.\"\nIn that moment, the room became silent. And as people began to make plans, I found myself looking out the window, where just across the street was the Capitol Dome with that majestic Statue of Freedom standing atop it; the dome that's a symbol of the ideals of this nation -- of freedom and democracy for all the world.\nSo we waited. It was the longest 12 minutes of my life. But it turned to 13 minutes, then 14, and then we were informed that the plane had gone down in a field in Pennsylvania.\nIn the days ahead like every American, we would learn the story of the 40 heroes of Flight 93 -- men and women who looked evil squarely in the eye and without regard to their personal safety, they rushed forward to save lives.\nThey were mothers and fathers. Your brothers and sisters, sons and daughters -- from every walk of life, of every background. Mark Bingham was on his way to be an usher in his college friend's wedding. CeeCee Lyles was living her childhood dream to be a flight attendant, in the wake of a career in law enforcement. Lauren Grandcolas carried the spark of life within her, an unborn child three months along. And Bill Cashman, himself a former Army paratrooper with the 101st Airborne, had actually helped build the World Trade Center with his own two hands. And there so many others whose names we just heard echo into the wind this morning.\nThey were ordinary people, but on that day, they became extraordinary. We all know the story. Flight 93 took off at 8:42 a.m., departing Newark to San Francisco, when 46 minutes later, terrorists seized control.\nAt 9:35 a.m., the plane diverted toward Washington, D.C.; the passengers called their loved only to find out what was happening across the country. They learned what the rest of America knew: The World Trade Center had been struck, the Pentagon had been hit only a few moments after they were hijacked. They figured out that the terrorists intended to use their plane for the same purpose.\nBut as Tom Burnett told his wife, on the phone, \"We're going to do something.\" And they did.\nThe men and women of Flight 93 began to join together. They devised a plan in those short moments. They knew their objective. And they not only planned, but history records that they prayed. Together with Lisa Jefferson, a phone operator on the ground below, we're told they prayed the Lord's Prayer, and recited those ancient words -- \"though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.\"\nAt 9:57 a.m., after only 29 minutes, Todd Beamer spoke those words that America and the world will never forget: \"Let's roll.\"\nThey charged the cockpit. They took hold of their fate, and six minutes later, at 10:03 a.m., Flight 93 plummeted here to the Earth. The brave men and women aboard sacrificed their lives for the country we call home.\nWe gather here today because the men and women of Flight 93 are heroes, and this beautiful memorial stands as a testament to the American people's undying reverence for their service and sacrifice.\nEach of their 40 names are etched into this marble. They're carved into the memory of the American people, as well, even as they're seared into the hearts of you that were left behind.\nThe Bible tells us that \"The Lord is close to the broken-hearted,\" and to the families of the fallen here, that will be our prayer for you today.\nYou honor us by your presence. And as the President said this morning, \"You honor our heroes, you renew our courage, and you strengthen us all.\"\nToday as a nation, we mourn with you. We remember with you. And we look forward to the day when we will hear the chimes in this place, in the Tower of Voices, that will turn the whisper of the wind into a heroic call-to-action. It will remember them and echo across this field and across America for generations to come.\nAt 93 feet, that Tower of Voices that will be completed by this time next year will honor the heroes of Flight 93, and that soaring structure will hold 40 chimes, each with a different musical note, to symbolize the voices of the 40 men and women we remember today.\nThe notes when played together, I'm told, will form a perfect harmony -- just as, in their final moments, the men and women of Flight 93 worked together to defend freedom.\nThe American people will forever be inspired by their courage and resolve. We honor them by remembering them. And we honor them by ensuring that we do all in our power as a nation to prevent such evil from ever reaching our shores again.\nAs President Trump has reminded us -- (applause) -- as the President has reminded us, we are in the midst of a war between good and evil. And the first battle in that war took place in the skies above us and ended in this grassy meadow.\nWe cannot hallow this place beyond what the heroes of Flight 93 have already done. When the plane went down, the heroes aboard it were the first of a new generation of Americans to rise up, as citizen soldiers, in what would come to be known as the Global War on Terror.\nIt is remarkable to think that, in the wake of their service and sacrifice, America itself experienced a rebirth -- a rebirth of unity, of purpose, and a rededication to our most sacred ideal of freedom.\nAnd every day, for 16 years, their actions have inspired many more of our fellow citizens to stand up, to step forward, and follow in their heroic service.\nThe President said today, \"America cannot be intimidated.\" And in the aftermath of September 11th, we've seen tens of thousands of Americans step forward to serve their communities and protect our families and defend our freedom.\nThey've donned the uniform of first responders, firefighters, police officers -- and more than 5 million Americans have stepped forward to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States of America since September 11th. (Applause.)\nThese men and women turned what was a day of tragedy into a triumph of freedom, as our nation rallied together and charged forward to meet the enemy on our terms, on their soil.\nAnd we will always cherish the memory of the nearly 7,000 Americans who have given their lives on the field of battle since that day 16 years ago, today. Like the heroes of Flight 93, we will never forget their service, their sacrifice, or the families they left behind.\nBut we must remind ourselves on this solemn day of remembrance that the threat remains. And even now, the menace of global terrorism brings violence across the wider world to places like London and Paris and Barcelona.\nIn Iraq and Syria, the barbarians known as ISIS continue to plot attacks against America, against our allies, and all who cherish freedom.\nBut under the leadership of President Donald Trump, as our Commander-in-Chief, our armed forces have ISIS on the run in Iraq and Syria, and we will not rest or relent until we hunt down and destroy them at their source. (Applause.)\nAnd we also do well to remember that the perpetrators of 9/11 organized and orchestrated their attacks from a safe haven of Afghanistan. And just a few short weeks ago, President Trump renewed our commitment to see the fight in Afghanistan through to an honorable and enduring outcome that will be worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made. (Applause.)\nSome four weeks ago, President Trump expressed the full commitment of the United States to, in his words, \"destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them.\" And so we will.\nAmerica will remain engaged in Afghanistan until we eliminate the terrorist threat to our homeland and our people once and for all. We have made great gains, our resolve is stronger than ever, and I promise you, together, as one nation and one people, we will drive the cancer of terrorism from the face of the Earth. (Applause.)\nWe fight because our families deserve to live in safety and security. We fight because our fallen heroes demand justice. And so long as we have strength, we will honor their memories and do right by the people and the nation they died to defend.\nSo I'm here on behalf of our President and all the American people to pay a debt of honor -- a debt of honor to the heroes of Flight 93, a debt of honor to a generation of heroes that have followed their inspiring example, in and out of uniform, at home and abroad.\nBut I'm also here to pay a debt of gratitude to the heroes of Flight 93 on a much more personal basis; for their actions, on that day, in these skies, saved American lives. And as my wife, Karen, who joins me here today knows, it's a debt I don't think I'll ever be able to repay. Because among the many lives that were saved by their selfless courage, they might well have saved my own life that day, 16 years ago.\nYou know, this isn't our first time standing in this field, here in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Not more than a year after that fateful day, Karen and I brought our three small children here -- to this hallowed ground -- on a drive back from Washington to Indiana.\nThat day, we did not find this extraordinary memorial. We found only a makeshift memorial; no more than a plywood wall, painted with the names of the fallen, a timeline, and a wooden cross out in the field.\nIt was that day, with the help of a park ranger that I learned personally of the sequence of events of that day. I asked her: If the U.S. Capitol was, in fact, the target, at what time would the plane have reached the Capitol building?\nAnd what she told me I'll never forget -- for at the time she said, standing with hundreds of others, I was standing near the East Front of the House of Representatives. I will always believe that I, and many others in our nation's capital, were able to go home that day to hug our families because of the courage and selflessness of the heroes of Flight 93.\nSo for me, it's personal. And I speak on behalf of a grateful nation. But thank you for giving me the privilege of speaking on behalf of my little family as well.\nWhen heroes fall, the nation mourns, for \"no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.\"\nTo the families of the fallen, as President Trump promised this morning I say now, the memory of your loved ones will never die. They will always be with us. Their heroic story in our minds, our hearts, enshrined in the memory of this country.\nAs long as America endures, we will tell their story and generations of Americans will ever be inspired by the faithful and courageous words and deeds of the heroes of Flight 93.\nMay God bless our beloved fallen. May God bless and comfort the families gathered here, and all those who suffered loss on this day 16 years ago. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\nI want to thank you, Secretary Mattis, General Dunford, members of the Cabinet, members of the Armed Forces, first responders, and most importantly, to the families and to the survivors: It's an honor to join you on this very, very solemn occasion. This is an occasion that is extraordinary, and it will always be extraordinary.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to send our nation's prayers to everyone in the path of Hurricane Irma and to everyone suffering through the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. These are storms of catastrophic severity, and we're marshaling the full resources of the federal government to help our fellow Americans in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and all of those wonderful places and states in harm's way.\nWhen Americans are in need, Americans pull together -- and we are one country. And when we face hardship, we emerge closer, stronger, and more determined than ever.\nWe're gathered here today to remember a morning that started very much like this one. Parents dropped off their children at school. Travelers stood in line at airports and getting ready to board flights. Here at the Pentagon and at offices all across the country, people began their early meetings.\nThen, our whole world changed. America was under attack. First at the World Trade Center, then here at the Pentagon, and then in Pennsylvania. The horror and anguish of that dark day were seared into our national memory forever. It was the worst attack on our country since Pearl Harbor and even worse because this was an attack on civilians -- innocent men, women, and children whose lives were taken so needlessly.\nFor the families with us on this anniversary, we know that not a single day goes by when you don't think about the loved ones stolen from your life. Today, our entire nation grieves with you and with every family of those 2,977 innocent souls who were murdered by terrorists 16 years ago.\nEach family here today represents a son or daughter, a sister or brother, a mother or father, who was taken from you on that terrible, terrible day. But no force on Earth can ever take away your memories, diminish your love, or break your will to endure and carry on and go forward. Though we can never erase your pain, or bring back those you lost, we can honor their sacrifice by pledging our resolve to do whatever we must to keep our people safe. (Applause.)\nOn that day, not only did the world change, but we all changed. Our eyes were opened to the depths of the evil we face. But in that hour of darkness, we also came together with renewed purpose. Our differences never looked so small, our common bonds never felt so strong.\nThe sacrificed [sanctified] grounds on which we stand today are a monument to our national unity and to our strength. For more than seven decades, the Pentagon has stood as a global symbol of American might. Not only because of the great power contained within these halls, but because of the incredible character of the people who fill them. They secure our freedom, they defend our flag, and they support our courageous troops all around the world.\nAmong the 184 brave Americans who perished on these grounds were young enlisted servicemembers, dedicated civil servants who had worked here for decades, and veterans who served our nation in Korea, in Vietnam, and in the Middle East. All of them loved this country and pledged their very lives to protect it.\nThat September morning, each of those brave Americans died as they had lived: as heroes doing their duty and protecting us and our country. We mourn them, we honor them, and we pledge to never, ever forget them. (Applause.)\nWe also remember and cherish the lives of the beloved Americans who boarded Flight 77 at Dulles Airport that morning. Every one of them had a family, a story, and beautiful dreams. Each of them had people they loved and who loved them back. And they all left behind a deep emptiness that their warmth and grace once filled so fully and so beautifully.\nThe living, breathing soul of America wept with grief for every life taken on that day. We shed our tears in their memory, pledged our devotion in their honor, and turned our sorrow into an unstoppable resolve to achieve justice in their name.\nThe terrorists who attacked us thought they could incite fear and weaken our spirit. But America cannot be intimidated, and those who try will soon join the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle. (Applause.)\nIn the years after September 11th, more than 5 million young men and women have joined the ranks of our great military to defend our country against barbaric forces of evil and destruction. American forces are relentlessly pursuing and destroying the enemies of all civilized people, ensuring -- and these are horrible, horrible enemies -- enemies like we've never seen before. But we're ensuring they never again have a safe haven to launch attacks against our country. We are making plain to these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large Earth.\nSince 9/11, nearly 7,000 servicemembers have given their lives fighting terrorists around the globe. Some of them rest just beyond this fence, in the shrine to our nation's heroes, on the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. They came from all backgrounds, all races, all faiths, but they were all there to dedicate their lives, and they defend our one great American flag. (Applause.)\nThey -- and every person who puts on the uniform -- has the love and gratitude of our entire nation.\nToday, as we stand on this hallowed ground, we are reminded of the timeless truth that when America is united, no force on Earth can break us apart -- no force.\nOn the morning of 9/11, Pentagon Police Officer Isaac Ho'opi'i and -- a special person -- was one of many heroes whose love for his fellow Americans knew no bounds. He was a mile away when he got the call over his radio that a plane had crashed into the Pentagon. He sped to the scene and raced into smoke and fire. Few people would have done it. He ducked under live electrical wires and trudged through puddles of jet fuel only steps away from sparks and from vicious flame.\nIn the pitch black, he began calling out people in need of help. Isaac heard faint voices and he wanted to answer those faint voices. One by one, he carried people out of the burning rubble. He kept going back into the smoldering darkness, calling out to anyone who could hear, anyone who was alive. He saved as many as 20 people who had followed his voice; he carried eight himself.\nFor nearly 36 hours, Isaac kept on saving lives, serving our nation, and protecting our safety in our hour of need. And today, Isaac continues to do exactly that. Isaac still works at the Pentagon, now as a sergeant. He's on duty right now, and he's joined us here today for the ceremony. And this morning, all of us -- and all of America -- thank Isaac for his service. Where is Isaac? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Isaac. Thank you.\nTo Isaac and to every first responder and survivor of the attack, you carry on the legacy of the friends you lost. You keep alive the memory of those who perished. And you make America proud -- very, very proud.\nTo the family members with us today, I know that it's with a pained and heavy heart that you come back to this place. But by doing so, by choosing to persevere through the grief, the sorrow, you honor your heroes, you renew our courage, and you strengthen all of us. You really do. You strengthen all of us.\nHere on the west side of the Pentagon, terrorists tried to break our resolve. It's not going to happen. But where they left a mark with fire and rubble, Americans defiantly raised the stars and stripes –- our beautiful flag that for more than two centuries has graced our ships, flown in our skies, and led our brave heroes to victory after victory in battle. The flag that binds us all together as Americans who cherish our values and protect our way of life. The flag that reminds us today of who we are, what we stand for, and why we fight.\nWoven into that beautiful flag is the story of our resolve. We have overcome every challenge -- every single challenge, every one of them -- we've triumphed over every evil, and remained united as one nation under God. America does not bend. We do not waver. And we will never, ever yield.\nSo here at this memorial, with hearts both sad and determined, we honor every hero who keeps us safe and free, and we pledge to work together, to fight together, and to overcome together every enemy and obstacle that's ever in our path.\nOur values will endure. Our people will thrive. Our nation will prevail. And the memory of our loved ones will never, ever die.\nThank you. May God bless you. May God forever bless the great United States of America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-09-11", "title": "Remarks at a 9/11 Memorial Observance in Arlington, Virginia"}
{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128287", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:45 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. This morning, we had the honor of joining of the President at the Pentagon to observe the anniversary of September 11th with the families and survivors of the horrific attack on our homeland that took the lives of 2,977 of their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, husbands, and wives 16 years ago. The lives of those survivors and families were changed forever on that day, and our country has never been the same since the unimaginable evil of terrorism reached our shores.\nIn response to the attacks we are memorializing today, the Department of Homeland Security was created and given a vital mission: securing our nation from the many threats we face, from counterterrorism and border security, to disaster preparedness and relief, which we know all too well in light of FEMA's work surrounding Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\nThe men and women, in responding to these storms, embody the spirit under which DHS was established. The President recognized a Pentagon police officer this morning who sped to the scene of the crash at the Pentagon as soon as he heard of the attack, and saved as many as 20 people. Like Isaac, the first responders to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey are running directly into danger to save lives and serve our nation. I hope that every American can take comfort in the fact that, in the face of unbelievable tragedy, this country has always come together to heal, protect, and save.\nFrom the firefighters and police officers who rushed into burning buildings on 9/11 to the first responders on the ground in Florida, the United States Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, FEMA, through its national and regional response coordination centers and liaisons to the National Hurricane Center, continues to actively monitor the track of Hurricane Irma and support local authorities responding to the damage the storm has already caused.\nI'd like to bring up Tom Bossert, the President's Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor to provide an update on issues related to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey before I take questions. As always, he'll make an opening statement and take questions, and then I'll be back up to answer further questions.\nMR. BOSSERT: Thanks, Sarah. Good afternoon. It's a somber day today. And I, and Sarah, and others were honored to join the President at the Pentagon in a moment of silence, on the South Lawn as well.\nIn addition, I would note that President Trump continued a long tradition of Presidents since 9/11 to receive a counterterrorism briefing this morning in the Oval Office from his intelligence community, from his Director of National Counterterrorism Center, from myself, and others on the team. The purpose of that is to give the President a sense of the terrorist threat that exists globally and to the homeland, and to give him a sense of what we're doing about it, and make sure that he's comfortable with our posture.\nAs I said the other day, we don't have any current, active threats against the homeland to our knowledge, and that's a good news story for today.\nLet me move into a quick thought. Before I do it though, Sarah noted that we created the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of 9/11. I would note that the government engaged in a massive reorganization of its structures and efforts to create a National Counterterrorism Center; to create a Department of Homeland Security; an Office of the Director of National Intelligence; a U.S. Northern Command, which you've seen now marshal resources in an expert fashion for this storm; a combatant command in the United States of America; and Cyber Command, which you've seen recently President Trump elevate to a full combatant command.\nAnd so we've marshaled our resources and we've organized them in a way to confront the threat of terrorism, but also to organize ourselves in a way that would allow us to respond to any event, from a manmade hazard to an unfortunate terrorist attack, but also to a hurricane.\nSo let me see if I can today talk to you about what we've done. I believe Harvey, as I said earlier, was the best integrated, unified, joint federal, local, state response effort that our country has seen in its history. I continue to stand by that. We've got roughly 700,000 registrants now for individual assistance in the greater Houston and South Texas area. Governor Abbott continues to demonstrate leadership, and President Trump continues to work with him and direct his Cabinet to not lose focus on the people of Texas.\nWith respect to Hurricane Irma, as you now know, it's a tropical depression. That does not mean it's not a dangerous storm. As you'll see from reporting, Jacksonville is suffering what has been called early some of the worst flooding it has seen in 100 years. And so the category might be reduced, but the effects on Jacksonville, for instance, when you combine storm surge and wind, might now replicate that of a Category 3 storm, even though it's a tropical depression.\nSo as that flooding is ongoing, we have lifesaving, life-sustaining operations underway, and we are prayerful that there are not people right now trapped by floodwaters.\nThe President spoke this morning to the Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Governor Mapp expressed -- and I joined that call -- his thankfulness to our administration's help, with the U.S. government providing such a rapid response and an ongoing response, I would add.\nSo if I could on that, I'll speak to it later. But the mobilization of our military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation. And we now have an Air Force aircraft carrier deployed in this effort; this was the first-ever as well.\nSo we have the largest flotilla operation in our nation's history to help not only the people of Puerto Rico, the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but also of St. Maarten and other non-U.S. islands affected, and the people of Florida.\nWith respect to Puerto Rico, the President spoke to the Governor of Puerto Rico this morning around 11:30 a.m. and they discussed similarly how happy they were with the federal response to their needs. The governor communicated to the President that they still have a large, island-wide power outage problem that we are addressing as soon as we can.\nAnd then Florida, if I can speak to Florida -- I think Governor Scott has been demonstrating an outstanding leadership instinct and pressing forward, continuing the message of getting people out of harm's way -- which, by the way, is an ongoing effort. The storm is still hitting the United States, in Georgia and South Carolina. It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress.\nGovernor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions.\nAnd then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that's kind of my lesson for today.\nI'd like to take questions now.\nJohn.\nQ: Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government?\nMR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now.\nBut what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively. What we have now is a large scale area of operations. So what we're trying to do is marshal the resources where they're needed, and so it's a prioritization effort.\nWe are worried about flooding, housing, debris, and power restoration. And power restoration is also a function of access to fuel -- refined fuel. So as you'll see the next days and week play out, we will have to clear debris from roadways so that people can gain reentry. Right now though, the message is not to rush reentry. There are still dangerous conditions, downed electric lines, flood conditions, problems that would be compounded by your reentry.\nAnd so listen to your local officials, not only about evacuation but then about when and how to stagger your reentry, for a reason. There's a life safety reason, a public safety reason.\nhere's our priority set. Eventually we'll move into issues about recovery and insurance and so forth.\nQ: Tom, what are you doing on the fuel front?\nMR. BOSSERT: On the fuel front, what the federal government is doing at this stage, and what we did in the three or four days building up to this event, was to get out of the way. And by that, I mean we waived regulations, we waived rules, we waived the Jones Act restrictions to free up additional capacity.\nFlorida is a uniquely postured state in the way it receives refined fuel. It's not part of the larger pipeline system throughout the country. It receives fuel by ship or tank -- by ship tanker. Those ship tankers then link into intermodal sites, where they fill up trucks and trucks distribute.\nAnd so what we'll do is clear those pathways, assess those three ports where those tankers dock, make sure they're not damaged, and we'll get things back up and running. Florida Power & Light and others, the nuclear power generation facilities, Duke Energy and others, they'll continue with their professionalism and they'll bring those facilities back up as soon as possible.\nQ: Tom -- yes, hi. Do we have any agreements in place with the private sector to contribute to the both response and recovery -- talking about Costco, Home Depot, Walmart -- so that we don't have to deplete the disaster relief fund? As a public service.\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, no, -- absolutely. So two things. First, there's a partnership in terms of coordination, where those private-sector entities are actually built into our coordinating centers so that they can understand what we're doing and how to prioritize their re-opening of facilities and the safety of their workforce.\nBut secondly, it is our absolutely baseline doctrine nowadays in the emergency management community that we would rather reopen those stores and continue providing food, water, and temporary shelter to people. It's just not within their regular course of operating business. It's not routine, and it's not something that we can easily sustain. So it's healthier, better, faster for us to reopen those stores as fast as possible. Thanks for that question.\nQ: Mr. Bossert, the previous administration saw a connection between climate change and homeland security in that the frequency and intensity of powerful storms, like Harvey and Irma, could pose a problem for future administrations. You could have a FEMA budget that can't keep up with the demand when you have powerful storms hitting the country. Is that something that you think this administration should take a look at? We know the President pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. Are these storms giving this administration some pause when it comes to the issue of climate change and homeland security?\nMR. BOSSERT: I was here in the 2004 cycle of hurricanes, four and six weeks that hit Florida. I think what's prudent for us right now is to make sure that those response capabilities are there. Causality is something outside of my ability to analyze right now.\nI will tell you that we continue to take seriously the climate change -- not the cause of it, but the things that we observe. And so there's rising flood waters -- I think one inch every 10 years in Tampa -- things that would require prudent mitigation measures. And what I said from the podium the other day, and what President Trump remains committed to, is making sure that federal dollars aren't used to rebuild things that will be in harm's way later or that won't be hardened against the future predicable floods that we see.\nAnd that has to do with engineering analysis and changing conditions along eroding shorelines, but also in inland water and flood control projects.\nQ: And just to follow up on that, when you see three Category 4 hurricanes all on the same map at the same time, does the thought occur to you, \"Geez, you know, maybe there is something to this climate change thing and its connection to powerful hurricanes\"? Or do you just separate the two and say, \"Boy, these are a lot of big hurricanes coming our way\"?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well I don't know if I say either, but I do know that there is a cyclical nature of a lot of these hurricane seasons. And I thank the scientists for their forecasts on this particular one. They were dead on that this would be a stronger and more powerful hurricane season, with slightly more-than-average large storms making landfall in the United States. So we'll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date.\nSir.\nQ: To follow up a little bit on just the budget. What kind of pressure -- you've had wildfires in the West, two major hurricane strikes -- but what pressure on the federal government's budget has these natural disasters put and how are we going to react to it? Are there going to be programs cut? Are there going to be reassessments of what goes on in order to rebuild the infrastructure? It's going to take several years.\nMR. BOSSERT: I think the President and Director Mulvaney and others started the process of a bipartisan discussion on this point. I think right now we have plenty of resources to get through this; that was the nature of the appropriation that we saw and the second appropriation that we will see at the end of this month subject to the regular course of order in the fiscal year.\nWe'll ask for a third, perhaps fourth supplemental appropriation for the purpose of rebuilding. We'll do it smartly, to the previous question -- but in terms of pressure on the budget, this is a disaster-relief-fund issue. It's funded a little bit differently, and I have every belief that this President will end up with proposals as he's started this administration with that will lead to a balanced budget.\nBut to get too far into how that works and the politics is way outside my lane, and I'll --\nQ: Just to follow up, at any point in time as you're taking a look at this issue, is there any chance that FEMA, the EPA, and some of the places that were cut will see more money go into their budget?\nMR. BOSSERT: I think that we'll put money in as money is needed to address the need. So I think what you'll see here is the same trend that I alluded to earlier. In 2004, we had a large spike in disaster-relief funding, but we also had to elevate the cap on flood insurance. And we'll probably end up having to do that again here.\nYou'll see, though, over a longer span of time even the flood insurance budget is red and black, red and black again based on claims and based on premiums. So we'll analyze it in that fashion, but I don't have any prediction for you on that.\nMa'am, in the middle.\nQ: Tom, I asked you two weeks ago about Harvey, and you said -- I asked you about housing. And I wanted to know if you had an update on the issues of housing, since now we've had Harvey and now Irma and what else is coming along the way. Can you give us an update as to locating housing for those who've been displaced?\nMR. BOSSERT: Locating housing in Texas?\nQ: Housing in Texas, housing -- I mean, for those who need housing, be it Texas, be it outside of the state, what have you come up with?\nMR. BOSSERT: So I'll answer both. So in Texas, again, going back to praising the Governor, he's done what we haven't seen done so well in the past, and that is he's owning the housing problem with a task force that he's initiated. He's also assigned a person to be in charge of long-term recovery.\nAnd there's four or five solutions to the housing problems in Texas. Of course, some of them are short lived, and what you'll have to do is find short-term solutions. People can stay in their home -- it's been flooded -- when the drywall is ripped out, when the repairs begin, they're going to have to find another place to live temporarily. So we try to find hotel solutions.\nIn some cases, FEMA has initiated a manufactured housing solution where they'll put a mobile home or travel trailer on your property that you can live in for a period of time while your home is being repaired. Those are the ideal solutions when there's enough acreage on your lot for that housing unit to sit. You can then move back into your home and we can remove that temporary unit. That's essentially the option that we have right now.\nThe third option, of course, is just distance. So there's available rental stock, but you have to draw a larger circumference as people move away from their homes and into rental stock available farther away. So we have some analysis done on the available rental stock and the available manufactured housing stock. We can get that to you after the podium brief here.\nIn Florida, we'll have a slightly different issue. But we haven't assessed yet entirely what the damage is. So that --\nQ: Will it be kind of like the same model?\nMR. BOSSERT: Florida will be the same model. But remember, it's a peninsula, and it's a wider scale problem, and it's been a larger swath storm.\nAnd so what we'll do there is assess whether those are the right models or whether we have to apply some different creative solutions. If we do, we have the authorities and we have the budget to do so, and we'll make sure people are taken care of.\nQ: And during the Bush years, there was a very big concern about the mobile homes -- and then they wound up having issues with formaldehyde. Is that all cleared up, all of that concern before? There was a big concern about mobile home communities just being in place after Katrina. Is that kind of out of the mindset now? Or is it still part of the mindset?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, the mindset of making sure that people have a safe place to live is still very much alive.\nWhat we do as a government is purchase available manufactured housing. We don't make it, and we purchase it off the open market. I think the open market has improved their building practices, and I think that we've improved through that experience in knowing who to buy from and who not to buy from.\nI also understand that problems of ambient air quality continue to persist in our everyday lives, so I don't know how much formaldehyde is in this room right now, but I do know that formaldehyde is a carcinogen at any level. (Laughter.) The point here is that we take it very seriously, and we'll make sure we message very seriously the importance of, basically, ventilation.\nBut to my knowledge, we buy off of a better market now, and we provide that solution in a more tailored and responsible manner.\nIf I could maybe come up front.\nQ: Tom, a couple of questions about the conditions in Florida. First of all, more than half of Floridians are now without power. It's usually a very local issue, but this is a catastrophe of a much greater scale. When is it your assessment that people in Florida can expect to get their power back? And what's the federal government's role in making that happen?\nMR. BOSSERT: So my numbers now are somewhere north of 5 million. If the number is higher, I don't know if that constitutes half the people on Florida, but I'll take your word for it.\nQ: It's 5 million households and businesses, so it's a lot more people.\nMR. BOSSERT: It's a significant -- it's a significant number. To the extent that a customer might have four people in the household, you'll see that number increase. The number of people then would be four in the home, the number of customers would be one. So that's the difference.\nThe idea here is, as I said earlier, we all have a joint role in this. Florida Power & Light, Duke Electric, others will all be bringing forces to bear here. The U.S. government brings to bear a number of forces that are imperative to the restoration effort, like pushing debris out of the road and clearing roadways.\nYesterday what we saw was not just the reports of, but the actual evidence of -- this will be the largest ever mobilization of line restoration workers in this country. Period. End of story. They were already mobilized yesterday. They were at the Daytona Speedway. We will have line restoration workers from every company in this country, from states all over this country, but also from Canada, coming to Florida to help restore the lines.\nAnd so in Florida, unlike in Houston, where they're buried power lines, in Florida they're all strung on poles. So we have to restore the poles, restring the lines. And the way that process works is they restore the plant, then the sub-plant, then line by line into each road, and then house by house. And you can't hook up each house until the homeowner makes sure that it's safe. You don't want to burn the house down with flood damage and corroded lines and so forth.\nSo it is a -- literally -- joint effort from federal clearing, to public and private partnerships, to line restoration efforts that are partnered in the for-profit and regulated world all the way through to the individual homeowner. So that's how that process works.\nQ: What's your assessment of how long that's going to take? How long are these people going to be in the dark?\nMR. BOSSERT: I would caution people to be very patient here. Between reentry and that process, we could have power down in homes for the coming weeks. Weeks.\nNow, I don't want to cause any panic in Florida -- and I'll come to a question here next -- there are hospitals and nursing homes and other facilities that have generator power to provide services that are necessary. And there, the concern is providing fuel to those generators should they run out. And from that perspective, the federal government provides a great deal of fuel, a great deal of transport assistance through TRANSCOM and other contracts. And we give that fuel to the state and locals, and they distribute it to those -- I say wholesale and retail distribution -- that's the best analogy. They distribute it to those facilities. And so that's our role there, as well. And we expect that to happen seamlessly.\nSir.\nQ: Thank you, Tom. Is preventing price gouging in the state of Florida a federal responsibility? Or is that up to state officials in Florida and local officials there?\nMR. BOSSERT: It can be both. And I think you'll hear from the Attorney General later, so I'll let him explain to you what he'll do to prevent fraud. I think he's going to announce an effort on that this week. And I think you've already heard Pam Bondi announce that she is conducting active gouging and anti-fraud practices when there are state and local laws at play.\nSo \"both\" is the answer, but I can tell you that neither officials -- the Attorney General of the United States or the attorney general or attorneys general of the states are going to tolerate gouging. I think that's something that people ought to think twice about.\nSir.\nQ: You raise the possibility of a third and fourth supplemental for disaster relief. Can you tell us how much money the administration wants included in the supplementals? And are you going to put language raising the cap for flood insurance in that legislation as well?\nMR. BOSSERT: So on the first point, no. The reason we pursued this approach is we're trying to make sure that we have responsible estimates as opposed to making wild guesses now. We're going for the amount of money we need to get through this response operation phase. And as we transition into recovery, we'll analyze the damage, figure out how much money we might need, and go up for another responsible request.\nIf we got that wrong, then we'd go for another if necessary. It's not necessarily wrong, but if we estimate a world and find actuals don't meet those estimates, then we'll go up and rectify.\nWith respect to flood insurance, we'll see how many claims come in. But the flood insurance program had $8.6 billion, roundabout, available to it. If claims exceed that amount, we'll go up and ask for the cap to be raised.\nSir.\nQ: I was hoping you could drill down a bit more on the efforts to evacuate Americans in the Caribbean. You described the military mobilization. I know the State Department task force, they're working around the clock in their operations. Can you assess those efforts? And can you give a message to Americans who are right now in dire straits in the Caribbean who might be listening to this? What should the expectation be for an evacuation? How soon can the Americans get the Americans out?\nMR. BOSSERT: While I'm preaching caution to make sure people understand that this is an ongoing effort and that there's still going to be long, painful days ahead, I am doubling down on my assertion that this is the best integrated, full-scale response effort in our nation's history. That includes the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and non-U.S. islands where we helped American citizens during a window of operational safety between Jose and Irma. This has been a large event, and you're going to see a lot of positive stories from it.\nNow, control expectations. You're on an island where we have to transport commodities -- food and water -- where we have a long road ahead of us to bring electric power back online. But we've assembled two of the most powerful naval relief flotillas in recent memory, a total of nine large ships. I'm going to just cut right to the Kearsarge, Oak Hill, Wasp, McLean, and the Abraham Lincoln, the Iwo Jima, the Farragut, and New York. That is an aircraft carrier, and large platforms for helicopters -- 80 or more helicopters flying sorties right now. That is an operation that for most Americans, if you can't picture, has never been mobilized for this type of emergency response effort in our history.\nAnd so to the extent that I can assess it, I'm pretty proud of that. To the extent that it meets the need, I'm going to hope it does because we're saving hundreds if not thousands of people off of these islands at this point collectively. And so if the burn rate is not fast enough, I would be surprised because we're mobilizing ourselves in ways that we've never mobilized before.\nAnd Governor Mapp, the President of the United States, and the Governor of Puerto Rico, Rosselló were all very pleased in their phone calls today. So I'm in no better position from this podium than they are from their locations to assess it as a positive outcome.\nSir.\nQ: Quick question on timing tomorrow. With so many people who evacuated from the Keys and given the level of destruction there, any time estimate on when people might be able to return to the Keys?\nMR. BOSSERT: They Keys are going to take a while. We have not assessed the structural integrity of the bridges there. There's some early reason to believe that some of the drawbridges that were up may or may not have been bent. So restoring those is going to take some time.\nThat Route 1 is a large, expansive bridge, essentially. All of the undergirding there has to be examined for structural integrity. I would expect that the Keys are not fit for reentry for regular citizenry for weeks. And if that's wrong and I'm wrong, then fine, then let the local officials bring you in. But I would set the expectation pretty broad right now.\nAnd I would say that for the people that choose to stay, they had every warning to leave, we hope that they took that warning. And those that didn't, we're going to get back down there as soon as we humanly can. And right now we don't know.\nWe had three or four overflights today. I talked to the FEMA administrator just before come out here, and he is not certain yet that we've had a good overflight assessment of where all those people might be. Neither of us would be surprised if lives were lost. But neither of us would be surprised if the responders are going to get down aggressively. So we're doing everything we can to help them.\nI see, Sarah. I'm going to actually end on that, if I could -- and end where I started. Today is the day of solemnity and remembrance for 9/11. It is why I got into this business, and it's why I believe our government is now organized for the level of response that we've seen. It just goes to kind of show what we've got if we want to bring ourselves together in helping our fellow humans. Under good leadership from President Trump, I think we've put forward a good effort.\nPlease, for the people in Florida, continue to follow the instructions of your first responders and your local authorities. This isn't over yet, and it's going to be a painful, slightly frustrating if not very frustrating week or two ahead.\nThank you all very much.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, Tom. As he wrapped up, he reiterated the need to listen to local authorities. I know that the Governor of Florida is getting ready to hold a press conference. I'm going to try to take as many questions as we can, but I also want to make sure that everyone is able to tune in for that and cover that extensively.\nFinally, before I take your questions, several of you have asked about the U.S. response to the ongoing violence in Burma, and I'd like to read part of a statement that will be coming out shortly on that topic.\n\"The United States is deeply troubled by the ongoing crisis in Burma where at least 300,000 people have fled their homes in the wake of attacks on a Burmese security post on August 25th. We reiterate our condemnation of those attacks and ensuing violence.\"\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nJeff.\nQ: Sarah, two questions. One, do you have a reaction to Steve Bannon's comments on \"60 Minutes,\" saying that the firing of James Comey was the \"biggest political mistake in modern history?\"\nAnd secondly, if you could look forward to tomorrow a little bit and the President's meeting with the Malaysian Prime Minister, what do you expect to achieve during that meeting? And will the President address or avoid the issue of the U.S. investigation into him?\nMS. SANDERS: Pretty wide-ranging topic, so I'll try to make sure I cover. First on the Comey firing, I think that we've been pretty clear what our position is. And certainly, I think that that has been shown in the days that followed, that the President was right in firing Director Comey. Since the director's firing, we've learned new information about his conduct that only provided further justification for that firing, including giving false testimony, leaking privileged information to journalists, he went outside of the chain of command, and politicized an investigation into a presidential candidate.\nI think the President has been very clear about his position on that front. He's very pleased with the new Director and has full confidence in him to fully restore and lead the FBI.\nIn terms of Malaysia and on that question -- hard transition, but I'll try to make sure we cover that -- the United States and Malaysia have had a 60-year relationship and partnership built on common economic and security interests, and that continues. And the President looks forward to discussing a wide variety and wide range of regional and security issues with the Prime Minister and talking about ways that they can strengthen counterterrorism cooperation, certainly the halt of ISIS, addressing North Korea and their continued actions, and making sure that we promote maritime security in the South China Sea.\nThose are certainly, I think, some of the priorities of tomorrow's meeting, but I'm not going to get ahead much further than that on any conversation that may take place.\nQ: (Inaudible) corruption probe?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we're not going to comment on an ongoing investigation being led by the Department of Justice, and that investigation is apolitical and certainly independent of anything taking place tomorrow.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I also have a question on Mr. Bannon's interview. During that he said, \"I think Mitch McConnell and, to a degree, Paul Ryan -- they do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic, nationalist agenda to be implemented. It's very obvious. It's as obvious as night follows day.\"\nFirst of all, does the President agree with that obvious characterization of McConnell and Ryan?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is committed to working with Congress to get some big things done. We've got a very big agenda. The President wants to work with all members of Congress. Obviously that includes Republican leadership, as well as Democrats. I think you saw some of the President's leadership last week when he helped strike a deal to make sure that we got the funding that was necessary.\nWe're focused on moving things forward, and certainly that's the goal and the priority of the administration.\nQ: So on that note, would he like to see -- given his past criticisms of Mr. McConnell and Ryan, would he like to see different leadership in the Republican Congress?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, right now, the President is committed to working with the leadership we have and nothing beyond that, at this point.\nJohn.\nQ: Sarah, just to follow up on Bannon's comments, he actually went and said all that about McConnell and Ryan, but also said that they were -- they wanted to nullify the 2016 election results. So just a simple yes or no question, does the President agree with that assessment?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. I haven't had that conversation with him, Jonathan.\nQ: Is he talking to Stave Bannon? Does he still seek his counsel on the outside?\nMS. SANDERS: I know they've had one conversation but I don't think anything beyond that since he left.\nJon Decker.\nQ: On Steve Bannon -- (laughter.)\nMS. SANDERS: Popular topic.\nQ: Yes, good topic. Did the President happen to watch --\nMS. SANDERS: I think we may be answering more questions on Steve Bannon now that he's not here then when he was, but go ahead.\nQ: You might be right about that. Did the President happen to watch the interview? Any reaction? Did you happen to watch the interview on 60 Minutes? And --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if he saw it in its entirety. I know he has seen clips of it but I don't know that he watched the entire thing. I did watch parts of it.\nQ: And what was your reaction to it? As a former colleague of yours -- he worked here at the White House -- were you disappointed with any of his comments? Were you surprised by any of his comments? Did you like the fact that a former staffer is speaking so openly about some of the inner workings of what happens here, at the White House, on a regular basis?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sure it made for great TV and I'm sure CBS will be happy to put those ratings out. As for me, I'm here to speak on behalf of the administration.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Why ruin a good thing, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS: Is that what this is -- a good thing? (Laughter.)\nQ: Staying on the topic of Steve Bannon, another comment he made with that, \"DREAMers should consider self-deporting when their work permits run out.\" Is that something that the White House thinks is realistic -- that the DREAMers would voluntarily leave the country when their work permits run out? And is that something the President thinks that they should do?\nMS. SANDERS: The administration has been clear what our position is. We're hoping that Congress will step up and do their job and fix this problem and implement responsible immigration reform, and addressing that problem would be part of it.\nQ: Last week, Nancy Pelosi told the Congress that the President would sign the DREAM Act. Is that accurate? And will the President sing the DREAM Act?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, the President and the administration are looking responsible immigration reform. And part of that would be part of that process, but we want to do something that addresses a multitude of issues. And again, Congress has six months to do their job. We're very hopeful and confident that they will.\nQ: In his 60 Minutes interview, Steve Bannon said that this discussion over DACA could lead to a civil war in the Republican Party. How and why is he wrong about that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that Steve always likes to speak in kind of, the most extreme measures. I'm not sure that I agree with that.\nJohn.\nQ: On a different topic --\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, wow.\nQ: In recent weeks --\nMS. SANDERS: Maybe you get two questions since --\nQ: In just a matter of weeks, two storms that have been categorized as \"once in 500 years\" or even longer -- major events -- have hit the United States. In light of that, has the President given any thought to reviewing his decision to leave the Paris Climate Accords?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure specifically on the Paris climate deal. But as he said at the time, the goal is to always do our very best when it comes to taking care of the environment and taking proper steps.\nThe United States is one of the best in the world at doing this. We want to continue to do that, but right now the administration is focused on the recovery and relief efforts. And as Tom said a few minutes ago, we'll look at that analysis once we get through the coming days, and focus on recovery and relief and saving-life effort taking place.\nHallie.\nQ: Two questions. To follow up on John's question a little bit here, and since you said you do speak for the administration, can you clarify whether the President believes human activity contributes to climate change?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has addressed this already.\nQ: But I'm asking you if that has changed given these storms?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that it's changed over the last several weeks. And again, he's addressed his opinion on that several times since.\nQ: So my second question is actually on something that happened back on August 10th, as you know -- which is the President declaring that he wanted to have a national emergency when it came to the opioid crisis. It has now been more than a month since he said that. That's a delay for a President who likes to do things quickly, as he has often said. Is the President taking this seriously enough? And when does he intend to declare this an emergency and actually get the ball rolling on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely -- taking it very seriously. The commission and members of the administration have continued to meet and work on the details of that national declaration. And that's certainly a big priority for the administration, and we'll continue to focus on pushing that through.\nQ: What's taking so long? You know, this is a President who likes to snap his fingers --\nMS. SANDERS: It's a much more involved process, and that's something that they're working through on the legal side, the administrative side, and making sure that it's done correctly.\nQ: I was going to ask about Steve Mnuchin -- (Laughter.)\nMS. SANDERS: Tricky, tricky, Bender.\nQ: He and Cohn are going up to the Senate tomorrow to talk to the budget committee. What do they want that budget resolution to look like? And does the administration support the House budget?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I don't want to get ahead of their conversations, and I'll let -- Secretary Mnuchin, I think, plans to address that in further detail tomorrow.\nJohn.\nQ: Another one on Steve Mnuchin real quickly. He took some criticism last week from Republicans for his handling of debt deal. What does the President think of Secretary Mnuchin's performance so far?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The President has confidence in Secretary Mnuchin and is glad that he is part of the effort, working with Gary Cohn, to get tax reform done this year.\nJohn.\nQ: Just to drill down a little bit on what you said a moment ago regarding James Comey. You said that he was responsible for giving false testimony. Do you believe that Comey either perjured himself before Congress or, at the very least, misled Congress in his testimony?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's something, probably, for DOJ to look at, not me. I'm not an attorney.\nJen.\nQ: Two questions, one of the Equifax leak and one on tax reform. If a big tax reform bill doesn't pass by December, would the President support adding middle-class tax cuts to the end of the year (inaudible) bill that the Congress has to pass?\nMS. SANDERS: We're focused on making sure we get a complete tax reform package. That's the goal.\nQ: (Inaudible) he would support --\nMS. SANDERS: Right now, that's the focus. And if that doesn't happen, we'll look at other options at that point.\nQ: And then on Americans' personal data security after the Equifax leak, is more regulation warranted for the handling of American's personal data?\nMS. SANDERS: I think this is something we have to look into extensively. Tom Bossert will be one of the primary people taking the lead on that front -- and certainly something we have to explore all the best ways to make sure that Americans are protected in that sense.\nQ: Was the President disappointed by Steve Bannon's comments on 60 Minutes?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if he was disappointed in the comments.\nQ: And secondly, did Steven Bannon warn the President that firing James Comey would be the biggest political mistake in modern history?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware that conversation ever took place.\nAs I mentioned when we started, the governor of Florida has a press conference that will be starting here in a few minutes. We want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to tune in.\nThe press team will be here, and we're happy to answer any questions, particularly if you have anything beyond Steve Bannon, we'd be even more than happy to answer.

It's great to have the Prime Minister of Malaysia and his very distinguished delegation with us today. We're talking about trade -- very large trade deals. We're working on one deal where between 10 and 20 billion dollars' worth of Boeing jets are going to be purchased, General Electric engines will be purchased, and many other things.\nAlso, Malaysia is a massive investor in the United States in the form of stocks and bonds, and the stock exchange. And they have to be very happy because we're hitting new highs on almost a weekly basis. And so we're very proud of our stock market and what's happened since I became President. So I congratulate you on those investments.\nBut I just want to say, it's an honor to have you here. It's an honor to have your delegation with us. I believe you'll be at the United Nations next week, and a lot of folks are going to be at the United Nations next week. It should be an exciting week, and we look very much forward to that.\nBut I want to thank you very much for all of the investment you've made in the United States. Also, the Prime Minister has a major role in not allowing ISIS -- or, as you say, Daesh -- and others to exist. And he's been very, very strong on terrorism in Malaysia, and a great supporter from that standpoint. So that's a very important thing to the United States.\nHe does not do business with North Korea any longer, and we find that to be very important. We had a vote yesterday on sanctions. We think it's just another very small step -- not a big deal. Rex and I were just discussing -- not big. I don't know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15-to-nothing vote. But those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.\nSo thank you everyone for being here, and we appreciate it. Mr. Prime Minister, it's a great honor to have you in the United States and in the White House. And thank you everyone for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nWould you like to say something?\nPRIME MINISTER RAZAK: Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your invitation for me and members of my delegation to meet with you at the White House. I want to say that we come here with a strong value proposition to put on the table.\nNumber one, we want to help you in terms of strengthening the U.S. economy. I come with three specific proposals. Number one, we intend to increase the number of Boeing planes to be purchased by MAS. We are committed to 25 planes of the 737 MAX 10, plus eight 787 Dreamliners. And there is a strong probability -- not possibility – probability that we will add 25 more 737 MAX 10 in the near future. So within five years, the deal will be worth beyond $10 billion. That's one. We will also try to persuade AirAsia to purchase GE engines.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Great.\nPRIME MINISTER RAZAK: Secondly, we have Employees Provident Fund, which is a major pension fund in Malaysia. They've got quite a big sum of capital to be exported. They have invested close to $7 billion, in terms of equity, in the United States. And they intend to invest three to four additional billion dollars to support your infrastructure redevelopment in the United States.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Great.\nPRIME MINISTER RAZAK: And thirdly, our sovereign fund, Khazanah, they have an office in Silicon Valley. They have invested about $400 million, in terms of high-tech companies, and they intend to increase that investment as well.\nSecondly, the other goal of your administration, Mr. President, which is to make the United States safe -- and with that, the world safe -- we are committed to fight Daesh, IS, Al-Qaeda, Abu Sayyaf -- you name it. They are the enemy of the United States, they are also the enemy of Malaysia, and we will do our part to make sure that our part of the world is safe.\nWe will also contribute in terms of the ideological warfare because you need to win the hearts and minds. And the key to it is to support moderate and progressive Muslim regimes and governments around the world, because that is the true face of Islam; that is the authentic face of Islam. The more you align with progressive and moderate regimes, the better it would be in terms of winning the hearts and minds of the Muslim world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Right.\nPRIME MINISTER RAZAK: So, Mr. President, thank you once again. The United States has always been our partner for a long, long time. And this year is our 60th anniversary of our relationship, and I hope that today's meeting will make it even stronger in the years to come.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much.

SANDERS: Good afternoon.\nQ: Good afternoon.\nMS. SANDERS: There's at least one person to say \"hi\" back. (Laughter.)\nThe President and the entire administration --\nQ: Good afternoon, Sarah.\nQ: Good afternoon, Sarah!\nQ: How are you? (Laughter.)\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, there we go. What a happy class, yeah. Now we're ready.\nThe President and the entire administration continue to monitor the situation in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas, and all areas affected by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.\nFEMA Administrator Long is traveling to the affected areas today, and the President will be making a trip to Florida on Thursday.\nThe President's action during these times demonstrate why he's a true leader who can bring the country together and get things done for the American people. He wants to continue building unity by working on more issues supported by both parties, especially restoring fairness to our broken tax code and cutting taxes for hardworking Americans.\nLast week in North Dakota, he invited Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp up on stage to welcome her during his tax reform event in her home state.\nTonight, he'll host Senator Heitkamp, along with colleagues of hers from both parties -- Senators Donnelly, Hatch, Manchin, Thune, and Toomey -- for a dinner at the White House to discuss working together to achieve real tax reform that allows Americans to keep more of their hard-earned dollars.\nAhead of the dinner this evening, Secretary Mnuchin and NEC Director Cohn are on the Hill this afternoon to continue their conversations with key members in this important policy push.\nThe Vice President also attended Senate Republicans' weekly policy lunch today and is meeting with House leaders on the upcoming legislative agenda.\nOn issues ranging from national security to hurricane relief, to keeping our government functioning, the President is reaching across the aisle and to cut deals that help the American people. The President truly believes, as he often says, that in order to succeed and grow, we must work as \"one team, one people, and one American family.\"\nFinally, speaking of family, I wanted to say a big congratulations to Eric and Lara Trump on the birth of their son, Eric Luke Trump, this morning. We all looking forward to meeting him soon.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. John.\nQ: Sarah, on tax reform. The Legislative Director, Marc Short, today, speaking to Christian Science Monitor breakfast, said that the one thing that you learn from Obamacare is that you can't even rely on your own party to bring the votes across the finish line. But then at the same time, you haven't really been able to get much bipartisan support either. So with that in mind, what is the President hoping to do tonight with this bipartisan dinner?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's start that conversation; start talking about things that we all agree on. As I've said many times, I think most everyone can agree that Americans should keep more of their money than the government. They spend it, certainly, far better than the government can. And I think that's something that is a common goal that a lot of people want to come together on.\nI think by nature of them sitting down with the President, that's a very good first start. I'm not going to get ahead of the dinner tonight, but I think that it shows and is a great indicator from both sides that we have a big agenda and a very ambitious agenda legislatively this fall. And we want to work together to make sure we can get as much of that done as possible.\nQ: It looks like you might be able to get some bipartisan buy-in on the idea of lowering the taxes for corporations, certainly middle-class tax cuts, but the Democrats are really drawing the line at tax cuts for the highest income earners. Can the President cut some sort of deal with them that sticks to his principles but then also satisfies them? Or is there an unbridgeable gulf there?\nMS. SANDERS: The President, I think, has demonstrated both in his business world and as President that he can make deals, and that's certainly what he's looking to do. And he's going to work hard to make sure that we get the best deal possible on tax reform. And I think that starts with things like tonight and having this conversation and moving that ball forward, working bipartisan support from both sides.\nSteven.\nQ: Sarah, the Treasury Secretary at another event this morning seemed to express an empathy for people who live in high-tax states like New York and California. If the administration goes forward and Congress approves a plan that eliminates the deductibility of state and local taxes, theoretically people in those states could see their taxes increase, not decrease. Is the administration committed to doing something to help people in those high-tax states?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, again, we're looking to work with Congress to make sure we get the best deal possible for all Americans across the board, and that includes people in high-tax states.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. It's being reported that the Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit here is staying at the Trump Hotel. Two questions on that. Did that come up at all in conversations with the President during their meetings? And is it problematic for someone under DOJ investigation to be supporting the President's for-profit company?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about -- if that came up. I'm not aware that that was ever discussed. And we certainly don't book their hotel accommodations, so I couldn't speak to the personal decision they made about where to stay here in D.C.\nQ: So you don't think that's in any way any sort of attempt to curry favor with the President?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I don't.\nCecilia.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Steve Bannon today apparently told a room full of people that he was speaking to that he talked to the President every two or three days. Yesterday you said you thought they had only spoken once. So do they speak more regularly than maybe you were led to believe? Or can you give us any insight to how often they're talking?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think they speak, certainly not that frequently. I'm aware of like two conversations that they've had, and nothing beyond that.\nQ: So it's not two to three days -- every two to three days, as far as you know?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. Again, I'm only aware of two conversations that have taken place.\nQ: I just want to get you quickly on one other topic. Why hasn't President Trump called the President of Mexico in the wake of that earthquake there to offer condolences? Why was it the Secretary of --\nMS. SANDERS: They actually have a call scheduled today. It's taking place, I believe, within this hour. And we'll have a readout for you on that this afternoon.\nMaggie.\nQ: Sarah, apologies if you answered this yesterday, but is the President aware --\nMS. SANDERS: It's okay, everybody here likes to ask the same question many times. (Laughter.)\nQ: Is the President aware that Steve Bannon described firing James Comey as the biggest mistake in modern political history?\nMS. SANDERS: Whether he is or not, I think that everybody knows exactly where the President stands on that issue. The President is proud of the decision that he made. The President was 100 percent right in firing James Comey. He knew at the time that it could be bad for him politically but he also knew and felt he had an obligation to do what was right, and do what was right for the American people and certainly the men and women at the FBI.\nI think there is no secret Comey, by his own self-admission, leaked privileged government information. Weeks before President Trump fired him, Comey testified that an FBI agent engaged in the same practice; they face serious repercussions. I think he set his own stage for himself on that front. His actions were improper and likely could have been illegal. Comey leaked memos to the New York Times, your own outlet. He politicized an investigation by signaling he would exonerate Hillary Clinton before he ever interviewed her or other key witnesses.\nHe is very happy with the decision he made, and I think he has been fully vindicated by a lot of those new things and knowing that it was the right one.\nDavid.\nQ: Where in Florida is the President going? And what's he going to be doing down there?\nMS. SANDERS: Those details are still being finalized. We hope to have some of that ironed out later today, and we'll certainly keep you guys posted on that travel.\nJonathan.\nMS. SANDERS: Sarah, two questions. First, a follow-up to the Malaysian Prime Minister's visit. Did the ongoing DOJ probe into corruption, did that come up in conversation with the President today? And then secondly, a different matter, next week of course the President is going to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. Past Presidents usually have a theme or a key idea they want to get across in their speech or some of their individual leader meetings. What will President Trump's be?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of the specific conversation coming up in today's meetings.\nIn terms of the U.N. General Assembly, I don't want to get ahead too far. We will plan to outline some of those plans and more details about that trip at the end of this week, as we have done in past practice on those types of meetings. And we'll certainly do that by the end of this week.\nHallie.\nQ: Thanks, I have two. Let me just follow up too. You said that the actions of James Comey could have been illegal. You, the other day, referred to potential false testimony. The DOJ is not commenting, but I would put to you, would the President encourage the DOJ to prosecute Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: That's not the President's role. That's the job of the Department of Justice, and something they should certainly look at.\nQ: Is that something you'd like to see?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about that specifically, but I think if there's ever a moment where we feel someone has broken the law, particularly if they're the head of the FBI, I think that's something that certainly should be looked at.\nQ: And on North Korea -- I'm sorry, Sarah, my second question on North Korea -- has this administration determined whether North Korea did test the hydrogen bomb?\nMS. SANDERS: We haven't released those details yet.\nQ: Has the assessment been made though?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, Hallie.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Yesterday, when you were talking about James Comey, you mentioned that he gave false testimony. I didn't hear you say that again today. Do you still stand by that?\nMS. SANDERS: I did say that actually today.\nQ: You did say --\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah.\nQ: Separately, when it comes to Steve Bannon, the Wall Street Journal reported that they spoke the other night. That's what Steve Bannon told the gathering in Hong Kong. Do you know if they discussed this \"60 Minutes\" interview? And has the President said that it's something he would like to discuss with Steve Bannon?\nMS. SANDERS: He hasn't said whether he would like to discuss that -- at least not to me -- on that front.\nJohn Gizzi.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions, if I may. First, going back to John's original question regarding the Christian Science Monitor breakfast this morning, Marc Short was also asked about whether the President still supports Senator Luther Strange. And when I asked you that question, you said legal constraints kept you from answering. He said this morning that he's standing by Senator Strange and he fully supports him in the runoff September 26th. Is that the White House's official position?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, the President has liberties that I don't, and legally I'm not allowed to comment on specific political elections that are ongoing. So I'm not going to weigh into that conversation.\nQ: But Marc Short can --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, I'm not in a place where I can comment directly from behind the podium about elections that are upcoming.\nQ: My other question is a political question as well. Two United States senators, Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona, face spirited primary challenges. State Representative Justin Simmons, a strong supporter of the President in Pennsylvania, declared his candidacy against Congressman Charlie Dent, who announced his retirement on Friday. Will the White House back challengers to sitting Republicans in primaries?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to weigh in on elections that are ongoing from the podium. That's something that the Hatch Act prohibits me from being able to do.\nJames.\nQ: Sarah, on North Korea, what did the President mean today when he said that the latest U.N. sanctions resolution was not a big deal?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he actually said this is a small step and part of the process. But, look, I think that the ultimate goal here is a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. That's what we have to push towards. We're going to continue taking those small steps, but at the same time we know that those very parties that voted to do this all have to do more. The President has called on them to do more, and we continue to hope that they will.\nQ: Is the President comfortable with his son, Donald Trump Jr., testifying publicly up on Capitol Hill?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, can you --\nQ: Is the President comfortable with his son, Donald Trump Jr., testifying publicly up on Capitol Hill? Senator Feinstein has indicated that she would like to see that happen. And separately, but on the same --\nMS. SANDERS: I think she said she'd just like to see him testify. Look, this administration has been very clear we're going to be transparent and cooperative with this process. We know that there was -- nothing improper took place, no wrongdoing. And we're ready to see this come to its full conclusion and everybody else to see that as well.\nQ: So the President would be comfortable -- judging by what you're saying, he'd be comfortable with his son testifying?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is comfortable with us being fully transparent and cooperating with this process, as we've done every day since it started and will continue to do as we move forward.\nQ: And finally, let me just ask a quick little follow-up question. Jared Kushner -- was there any discussion about him stepping aside earlier this year, leaving the administration?\nMS. SANDERS: No, no conversation that I'm aware of, and certainly no presentation as both the President's attorneys have gone on record to say.\nDavid.\nQ: Sarah, Marc Short also said today that the administration would not tie funding for a border wall --\nMS. SANDERS: I believe he actually said it would be premature to determine whether or not that would happen.\nQ: So I guess what I'm saying is, it seemed to leave the impression that the administration would be open maybe to a bill for the DACA recipients that would legalize them without any other strings. Is that what you're saying?\nMS. SANDERS: I think what we're saying is what we've been saying all along. We haven't mixed messages here. We want responsible immigration reform; that hasn't changed. The President is very much committed to the wall. We're also committed to some other principles that we've laid out, and none of those have changed.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Just a couple of questions, if I could, about the dinner tonight --\nMS. SANDERS: A couple?\nQ: -- on your efforts on tax reform. You mentioned guests this evening -- three Democratic senators -- Senator Donnelly, Senator Manchin, Senator Heitkamp, all up for reelection next year. Do you know how those particular guests were chosen, first of all?\nMS. SANDERS: I think just by their willingness to want to sit down and have these conversations with the President. Certainly something that we are looking forward to and hopefully will be very productive steps forward in the process of having a very ambitious legislative agenda for the fall.\nQ: Senator Jon Tester of Montana indicated today that he was not invited but is open to talking about tax reform. Does that mean that he perhaps could be a future guest of the President's for dinner? Will the President reach out to Senator Tester in that regard?\nMS. SANDERS: The administration has been clear we want to sit down with anybody who's willing to be serious about real tax reform for this country, about providing real relief for middle-class America, and actually looking to make bold changes. Those are the conversations we want to have. And I would imagine if Senator Tester wants to be involved in those and is serious about it, we'd certainly be willing to have that conversation with him.\nAlex.\nQ: Last year, on the campaign trail, the President said he wouldn't support amnesty. But last week he asked Congress to legalize DACA. So why the change of heart?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the President has spoken out very clearly that he wants us to make this decision based on a variety of factors. But the number-one thing is that he wants responsible immigration reform, and part of that is including that in the process.\nQ: But what convinced him to have -- to want responsible immigration reform?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: What convinced him to want responsible immigration reform now?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has always wanted responsible immigration reform -- something that is important for the country moving forward. But he also wants to make sure American jobs are protected, American citizens are protected, and that's why it can't be just one piece, but comprehensive.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Earlier, you referenced two things about the former FBI Director, James Comey. First you said, the leaking of information likely could have been illegal. You went on to say, something that could be looked at. Are you encouraging -- is this White House encouraging the Department of Justice to investigate the former FBI Director, James Comey, for leaking information?\nMS. SANDERS: No. As I told Hallie, this is anybody that breaks the law. Whatever that process is that needs to be followed should certainly be looked at. If they determine that that's the course of action to take, then they should certainly do that. But I'm not here to ever direct DOJ into actions that they should take.\nQ: And if I could follow on an earlier question, too. A lot of conversations here in Washington about the midterm elections in 2018. What role is the President looking to play in the 2018 elections? Will he be supporting specific candidates? And will he be using his support as leverage to have those members of Congress support his domestic agenda?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President is going to support the agenda and accomplishing things that help America. But in terms of specific elections and whether or not he's going to weigh in, as I've said to a couple of your colleagues already today, I'm not going to be able to weigh in from the podium on that.\nApril.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two topics. One, can you talk to us about the Tim Scott meeting tomorrow evening, and what's the crux of it? Also, it's supposed to be about Charlottesville, HBCUs, and just the African American perspective. What would you say is supposed to be taking place?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get ahead of their meeting. We'll certainly be happy to provide information after the meeting is over. But at this point, I think it's certainly a conversation that Senator Scott wanted to have with the President, and the President wanted to have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the Senator. I'm not going to get into anything beyond that at this point.\nQ: A clear understanding -- is the HBCU conference happening, or is it not -- the White House portion?\nMS. SANDERS: It is going forward. It is happening. It will take place here at the White House.\nQ: And last question. Just for an understanding, how does the President receive and give calls from his cellphone during work? I know it sounds very trite and small, but there's been a lot of controversy about how the President is being handled, I guess, by General Kelly and how he keeps certain people in, certain people out. And then you're hearing Steve Bannon say that he's had many calls, and you're saying -- or that he's talked to the President several times. And you're saying you're not aware of that.\nSo it leads us to believe that it's this conversation, this phone thing. Could you talk to us about the use of his cellphone? Is this like during the day, after hours, or what? Because there have been stories about this cellphone use and people calling --\nMS. SANDERS: There have been a lot of things that you guys have written that I've seen to be controversial. That one hasn't been something I've seen a whole lot about. But the President has access -- I mean, he can make calls from a landline, too. I'm not really sure what the question is here, whether or not he made a call from a cellphone or a landline.\nQ: But can you call from the White House? Those calls are more so logged. Do you have a log -- versus a cellphone. It's his personal phone, correct?\nMS. SANDERS: The President -- again, I don't sit in on every single call he makes. I'm telling you about what I'm aware of at this point. Certainly, we'll keep you posted, as we do with numerous calls that the President makes throughout the day and through the evening.\nKristen.\nQ: Sarah, on tax reform, two of the President's top advisors said that a 15 percent corporate tax rate at this point seems unlikely. Is the President prepared to back off of that demand for 15 percent?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is prepared to push for as low of a rate as we can get. We're going to continue to push for that and work with Congress to make sure we get the best deal possible.\nQ: Based on conversations, it seems like they're hovering around 20 percent. Would he accept a 20 percent corporate tax rate?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, the President is focused on getting the best deal possible. We're going to continue working to make sure we get that done.\nHunter.\nQ: Sarah, thank you.\nQ: Can I just ask you one on North Korea, Sarah? The President tweeted on January 2nd, \"It won't happen.\" He said, \"North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!\" Does he stand by that assessment, given everything that he has seen -- all of the nuclear provocations from North Korea?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, the President is committed to taking every step and keeping all options on the table in order to have a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you. Does the President believe that he needs to secure funding for a border wall before DACA? And I also have a second quick question.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think it would be -- as Marc Short said, and as your colleague pointed out, it would be premature for us to make those determinations at this point. But certainly something that we want to make sure happens is that there is a wall -- that's something the President is committed to -- but we also want comprehensive immigration reform.\nQ: And also, will the President be reading Hillary Clinton's book? (Laughter.) And what does he think about the excerpts that have gotten out so far?\nMS. SANDERS: Whether or not he's going to read Hillary Clinton's book, I am not sure. But I would think that he's pretty well-versed on \"what happened.\" And I think it's pretty clear to all of America. I think it's sad that after Hillary Clinton ran one of the most negative campaigns in history and lost, and the last chapter of her public life is going to be now defined by propping up book sales with false and reckless attacks. And I think that that's a sad way for her to continue this work.\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I have two questions. First, the Treasury Secretary said this morning that Janet Yellen is being considered for reappointment as Fed Chair. Is that something the President is considering? Is she on the short list? And how close is the President to making that decision?\nMS. SANDERS: When we have a personnel announcement, we'll certainly make sure everybody in the room knows.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about what the President said about North Korea earlier. He said that the U.N. Security Council resolution was \"nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.\" Is the President considering actions, including cutting off Chinese banks from the U.S. financial system?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, that all options on the table. That hasn't changed. The President has also said that he wants every country involved to step up and do more. This was a small step in that process, and we're hoping that they'll take a greater role and a more active role in putting pressure on North Korea.\nQ: A moment ago -- you've used the language \"responsible immigration reform\"; a moment ago you said \"comprehensive immigration reform.\"\nMS. SANDERS: I think the goal, again: responsible immigration reform; making sure that we have the principles that we've laid out and that I've laid out from up here accomplished in that package. So that's --\nQ: But not necessarily comprehensive as it had been talked about before?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, responsible immigration reform.\nBlake.\nQ: Sarah, you've talked a lot about cutting deals here with the President. Marc Short earlier today said that one of the lessons of the fall is you can't necessarily rely on 50 to 52 Republicans. And then he went on to say, \"We don't feel like we can assume that we can get tax reform done strictly on a partisan basis.\" So is it the belief of the White House that you are going to need Democrats in the Senate to get this across the finish line?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's the belief of the White House that we want to have bipartisan support. As I said several times earlier today, the goal is to have everybody come together and help provide tax relief for Americans across the board. We hope Democrats want to be part of that process. They certainly should.\nQ: Do you think you need them though? I mean, what Marc Short said is, what we learned from healthcare reform is, even though people have been talking since 2010 about doing one thing, that's not necessarily what they might do in 2017.\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's less about what we need and what the country deserves. The American people work hard every day. They should get to keep more of their money. That's what this President is focused on, and that's what we're focused on doing, is helping -- we'll work with Democrats and Republicans to make sure we get that accomplished.\nQ: Do you know of any Democrats that are close to supporting what the President and the Big 6 -- their framework?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we're in the beginning of those conversations, and hopefully, again, a lot of those people will come on board.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Let's drill down on that a little bit, on the idea of Democrats coming across the aisle to support the President's tax reform. The question is whether there's enough of a shared vision between Democrats and Republicans for what tax reform ought to look like. So can you give us one or two examples of things, elements of this deal that the President could put into the deal that would attract those Democratic votes, but that would not alienate any Republicans? What are the specific --\nMS. SANDERS: These are just the beginning conversations -- these conversations are just starting with the Democrats coming to the table. And as those take place, we'll certainly provide more information on that front. But this is just the very beginning, the first step in this process.\nThanks so much, guys. We'll be around the rest of the day to answer other questions if you have them. Thanks so much.\nEND 3:07 P.M.

Through bipartisan outreach efforts like this, President Trump is demonstrating his commitment to fulfilling his promises, and that includes producing tangible results on important issues like tax reform. The meeting was highly productive, and will spur constructive discussion moving forward.", "timestamp": "2017-09-13", "title": "Press Release - Readout of President Donald J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128247", "text": "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I am pleased to welcome this bipartisan group of Democrats and Republican lawmakers to the White House. More and more, we're trying to work things out together. That's a positive thing, and it's good for the Republicans and good for the Democrats. And this group knows that very well.\nWhether we can do the incredible things that we're doing -- and working in a bipartisan fashion, obviously, would be a positive and, I think, something, Tom, that we all feel good about.\nI want to thank Tom Reed. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He was there right at the beginning when it wasn't very fashionable. Right? And I really appreciate it.\nAnd Josh Gottheimer, for helping to organize this very important gathering. I think it's really -- the whole concept of what we're trying to do is very, very important.\nInspired by the example of our own citizens, we should be able to come together to make government work for the people -- that's why I was elected, that's why I ran -- and to provide jobs and opportunities to millions of struggling families. This includes tax reform that is pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-family, and pro-American. It's very simple. It's all pro-American.\nThere are four principles for tax reform: Make the tax code simple and fair; cut taxes substantially -- it will be the largest tax decree in the history of our country for the middle class; encourage companies to hire and grow in America.\nAnd by doing that, we're going to have to reduce the taxes for companies. Right now, we're at 35 percent and really much higher when you add state taxes in. And China is at 15 percent, and we wonder why are we not competing well against China. So they're at 15 percent and we're at 35 percent plus. And that doesn't work.\nAnd bring back trillions of dollars -- we have trillions of dollars overseas that we'll bring back, and we'll bring them back quickly.\nSo this is money that -- Josh and Tom and everybody in this room can tell you -- everybody has agreed to bring it back for years but it never gets done. So we're putting it down as part of our tax proposal.\nAnother bipartisan project that is urgently needed is infrastructure and infrastructure investment. For decades now, Washington has allowed our infrastructure to fall into a state of total decay and disrepair. And it's time now to build new roads, new bridges, airports, tunnels, highways, and railways all across our great land.\nWhen we set aside our differences -- and it's amazing how sometimes how little our differences are -- we put our country and we put the citizens of our country first. And that's what this is all about.\nSo we want to have a great new tax cut and tax reform, simplification, and massive cuts, and we want to get our country working again and competing again worldwide. And there will be nothing that can stop us.\nOn top of that, we'll be discussing probably a little bit of healthcare, because I know some information has come to light. So we'll be discussing -- because ultimately -- well, we have some Democrats, I won't speak -- I think I can speak for the Republicans, generally.\nBut we do want to do something very, very powerfully with respect to Obamacare. It has not worked; the rates are going through the roof. The numbers that you looked at -- no matter where you go, no matter where you look, healthcare is failing in our country. And we're going to get it changed, and we're going to get it changed fast.\nInfrastructure -- we'll be talking about. And we'll probably also be talking about DACA because we don't want to forget DACA. And it's already been a week and a half, and people don't talk about it as much.\nWe want to see if we can do something with regard to immigration, with regard to the 800,000 people that are now young people. They're not children anymore. They were children, now they're young people. But we want to see if we can do something in a bipartisan fashion so that we can solve the DACA problem and other immigration problems. So we'll be discussing that today.\nAnd then tonight, I'm having dinner with Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and we'll continue some discussions.\nSo we have a lot of things in the fire, but I think right now, first and foremost, so that we can compete again -- and especially in light of the fact that we had two massive hurricanes, the likes of which, I guess, our country has never seen. I don't think they have ever seen. One was the biggest ever in water and the other was the biggest ever in wind. And you put them together and we have devastation in Texas and in Florida, and we've done -- and other parts of our country, by the way.\nAnd I think we've gotten very high marks for the way we've handled them thus far, and we continue to handle them well. But they were very big and very powerful and it was very unfortunate.\nBut because of that, more than ever, we now need great tax reform and great tax cuts. So we are here as a group -- bipartisan -- to try and see what we can come up with.\nThank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nQ: Mr. President, some conservatives are skeptical of this new approach with Democrats. What would you tell them? Why have Leader Pelosi and Senator Schumer over tonight? What's your message for skeptical conservatives?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm conservative and, I will tell you, I'm not skeptical. And I think that if we can do things in a bipartisan manner, that will be great.\nNow, it might not work out, in which case, we'll try and do them without. But I think if we can do, in a bipartisan manner -- if you look at some of the greatest legislation ever passed, it was done on a bipartisan manner. And so that's why we're going to give it a shot. Right, Tom? And we'll see what we can do. And if it works out, great. And if it doesn't work out, great. Hopefully we'll be able to do it anyways -- Republicans.\nOkay? Thank you.\nQ: (Inaudible) 15 percent corporate tax rate with a bipartisan --\nTHE PRESIDENT: We're looking at a 15 percent rate. And we want a 15 percent rate because that would bring us low -- not by any means the lowest -- but it would bring us to a level where China and other countries are. And we will be able to compete with anybody. Nobody will be able to touch us. So we would like to see 15 percent.\nThank you very much everybody.\nAnd, by the way, lower for individuals -- much lower than that for individuals. And the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan. We're looking for the middle class, and we're looking for jobs. Jobs, meaning companies. So we're looking at the middle class and we're looking at jobs.\nQ: Will the wealthy have to accept higher taxes --\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty much where they are. If we can do that, we'd like it. If they have to go higher, they'll go higher, frankly. We're looking at the middle class and we're looking at jobs.\nOkay? Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-09-13", "title": "Remarks in a Bipartisan Meeting with Members of Congress"}

The two leaders underscored the importance of upholding and adhering to the rules-based maritime order. They called upon all disputing parties to implement their international legal obligations in good faith, and to avoid the threat or use of force, intimidation, or coercion. They further called on all disputing parties to exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities and refrain from action that erodes trust and confidence, and escalates tension, including the militarization of outposts. The two leaders reaffirmed that all maritime claims must be based on and resolved in accordance with international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nThe two sides reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the strategic partnership between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN) and to the continued implementation of the principles decided upon by the leaders of the United States and ASEAN in the 2016 Sunnylands Declaration.

The two leaders underscored the importance of expanding cooperation in priority areas, including maritime security, counterterrorism, and information sharing between our defense and security forces. They committed to pursue additional opportunities for joint exercises and training. The leaders also underscored the importance of enhancing maritime domain awareness through the development of maritime capabilities such as surveillance, communications, and information-sharing, and expressed their intent to continue discussions on funding of assets through the most effective mechanisms for developing these capabilities in order to advance regional security. President Trump welcomed Malaysia's intent to make an additional $60 million (USD) in defense procurements from the United States.\nThey discussed the need to end the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. Both leaders called for an end to the violence targeting civilian populations, and discussed the need for a strong international community response for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who have been victimized and displaced by violence, including those who have arrived in Bangladesh. Both sides urged the Myanmar government to end the violence against innocents and ensure that humanitarian relief reaches victims immediately.\nPresident Trump and Prime Minister Najib held a constructive discussion about the importance of good governance and the free flow of information to prosperity and a positive business environment.

They recognized the growing number of Malaysian undergraduate and graduate students studying in the United States, now numbering nearly eight thousand. They expressed anticipation for the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding sustaining the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program, one of the largest in the world, through 2020.\nThe two leaders discussed their commitment to further strengthening the Comprehensive Partnership to promote peace, stability, prosperity, and international consensus in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world.", "timestamp": "2017-09-13", "title": "Joint Statement for Enhancing the Comprehensive Partnership between the United States of America and Malaysia"}

Demonstrating a steadfast commitment to faith, family, and hard work, Hispanic Americans lift up our communities and our economy as entrepreneurs, executives, and small business owners, and make contributions in areas such as science, art, music, politics, academia, government, and sports. In fact, Hispanic-owned small businesses are the fastest growing businesses in America, starting at a pace 15 times the national average over the last decade. Hispanic Americans own more than three million American businesses and serve with honor in all branches of the Armed Forces, continuing a strong legacy of dedication to our country that has seen the Medal of Honor awarded to 60 Hispanic Americans.

We are united with them in hemispheric solidarity, based on a shared commitment to democratic principles. To secure a more prosperous, free Western Hemisphere, we are working to advance and maintain democracy in the region and secure free and fair trade among our regional partners. My Administration is dedicated to securing human rights in Cuba and Venezuela, and strengthening our cultural and philosophical ties with all our Latin American partners.\nThis month, we recognize the countless contributions of Hispanic Americans that help make our Nation a thriving and secure land of opportunity.

The members of our Armed Forces shine a light of freedom throughout the world, and as we celebrate our returning heroes, we also remember our heroes who never returned home. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, our Nation recognizes all American prisoners of war and service members missing in action who have valiantly honored their commitment to this great country.\nIt is our sacred obligation to pay tribute to the thousands of men and women of our Armed Forces who have been imprisoned while serving in conflicts and who have yet to return to American soil. We reflect on the brave Americans who, while guarding our freedom and our way of life, spent years of their youth imprisoned in distant lands. They paid an enormous price and remained dedicated to our sacred principles, even while under extreme duress.\nWe do not leave our fellow man or woman behind, and we do not rest until our mission is complete. For more than three decades, our country has conducted investigation and recovery operations in Southeast Asia with the help of the governments of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Whether in Southeast Asia, or in South Korea, Europe, the South Pacific, and in all other corners of the globe, we are committed to this most honorable mission of fully accounting for our missing personnel. We are encouraged by the progress made, but know our mission is ongoing until every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine missing in the line of duty is accounted for.\nAs Commander in Chief, it is my solemn duty to keep all Americans safe. I will never forget our heroes held prisoner or who have gone missing in action while serving their country. Today, we recognize not just the tremendous sacrifices of our service members, but also those of their families who still seek answers. We are steadfastly committed to bringing solace to those who wait for the fullest possible accounting of their loved ones.\nOn September 15, 2017, the stark black and white banner symbolizing America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over the White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; national cemeteries; and other locations across our country. We raise this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation to always remember the sacrifices made to defend our Nation.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

I want to start off by reiterating the messages that FEMA Administrator Brock Long and the President's Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Officer Tom Bossert made this morning regarding the ongoing relief efforts in the wakes of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.\nLife-sustaining operations are still underway, and we encourage everyone in the designated areas in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to register online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. That's the quickest way to register for federal assistance.\nAs I said yesterday, the President was pleased that members on all sides of the aisle came together last week under his leadership to deliver critical relief to those affected by the storms. And he has continued that spirit of bipartisanship and unity this week.\nLast night, he hosted Republican and Democrat senators to discuss advancing the administration's legislative priorities, particularly the importance of delivering tax cuts and reform for the middle class.\nToday, in addition to important meetings with Republican and Democrat House members and Senator Tim Scott, the President will also host Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi this evening for a bipartisan discussion on the upcoming legislative agenda, with a focus on tax reform. Historic tax reform is one of the most significant ways that we will jumpstart our economy, creating jobs and raising wages for all Americans.\nThe President and his team will continue to engage with all members of Congress who are willing to work with us to deliver this critical relief for the American people.\nFinally, on a slightly lighter note, I'd like to announce that Frank from Falls Church, Virginia, whose letter I read last month offering his services to mow the White House lawn, will be here on Friday. He'll work with the grounds-keeping crew here at the White House and will help cut the grass in the Rose Garden.\nThe President is committed to keeping the American Dream alive for kids like Frank, and we're all looking forward to having him here.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. John.\nQ: A couple of questions if I could, Sarah. First of all, can you give us a readout of the meeting that the President had with Senator Scott this morning?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. This was a very productive meeting that the President and the Senator both wanted to have; something to discuss potential solutions moving forward to bring the country together -- a focus on unity, also talking and touching on some of the priorities for the legislative agenda moving into the fall.\nQ: Did Senator Scott express his displeasure at all with the President's initial reaction to Charlottesville?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. They talked about it pretty in depth, but the focus was primarily on solutions moving forward. And that was what both people came to the meeting wanting to discuss, is what we can do to bring people together, not talk about divisions within the country.\nQ: Second question. Following the meeting that he had with the President last night, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said, in his perfect world you get 30 Democratic senators and 30 Republican senators agreeing on a plan for tax reform. Does the President believe he can get 30 Democratic senators and still stick to his principles for tax reform?\nMS. SANDERS: I think America hopes he can. I think for the sake of most Americans, the goal is -- I would actually set the sights much higher in that you have every member of the Senate come together to help pass massive tax cuts and bring tax reform to this country.\nQ: Thank you. Two questions if I can. The President's dinner tonight with Schumer and Pelosi -- they seem to be getting close -- but in the past, the President has called Chuck Schumer a \"clown,\" Pelosi a \"loser.\" But now he seems to recognize that he needs them. How does that work? What changed?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's less about him needing them but more about the President wanting to work with them and wanting to help move this country forward.\nAs we've said many times before, we've got a very ambitious legislative agenda for this fall, and the President wants to work with anybody that wants to move America forward. And if they're willing to do that -- sit down, be part of that conversation on both tax cuts and tax reform, responsible immigration reform -- then the President certainly welcomes those conversations.\nQ: But does he view Schumer and Pelosi as equal allies on the Hill for getting things done, on par with McConnell and Ryan?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President is a Republican, and certainly I think ideologically that's a much cleaner matchup. But again, if these people and these individuals, whether they're Democrats or Republicans, want to come together to push the President's agenda and the agenda that clearly the American people want to see, or they wouldn't have elected Donald Trump, then we're certainly happy to have that conversation and move that ball forward.\nNoah.\nQ: Hi. I know the President came out for Graham-Cassidy today, but a lot of people believe that may not come to pass. Senator Alexander has introduced a more incremental bill that would stabilize the insurance markets. Could the President support a bill like that, or does it have to be more of a full-scale repeal? And secondly, what does the President make of Democrats' efforts on single-payer?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the President, as well as the majority of the country, knows that the single-payer system that the Democrats are proposing is a horrible idea. I can't think of anything worse than having government be more involved in your healthcare instead of less involved.\nThe President is focused on looking at ways where government gets out of the way, people have more control over their own healthcare. And looking at ways to, again, fully repeal and replace would certainly be a priority, but we want to move the system forward and make sure that we're in a place that's actually sustainable and that we have a healthcare system that works; that people who are under that healthcare system actually have a say in.\nQ: But could he sign something that's not a full-scale repeal? Obviously, I'm not just saying single-payer, but something along the lines of what Senator Alexander --\nMS. SANDERS: We have to see the specific pieces of that legislation before we are going to weigh in on a hypothetical bill.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks. Two questions. First, is Vice President Pence going to be attending that dinner tonight?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe the Vice President is actually hosting another dinner at his residence with other members of Congress, and we'll make sure we get more details to you on that later today.\nQ: And on a different topic, I wanted to follow up on some statements you made yesterday about James Comey. You said some of his conduct likely could have been illegal. I was wondering what specifically you were referring to there, because the one thing you pointed out was those memos that were given to the Times, but those didn't contain any classified information and were handed over once he was a private citizen.\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, the memos that Comey leaked were created on an FBI computer while he was the director. He claims they were private property, but they clearly followed the protocol of an official FBI document. Leaking FBI memos on a sensitive case, regardless of classification, violates federal laws including the Privacy Act, Standard FBI Employment Agreement, and nondisclosure agreement all personnel must sign. I think that's pretty clean and clear that that would be a violation.\nQ: So what do you want to see happen?\nMS. SANDERS: That's not up to me to decide. I'm certainly not an attorney, but I think that the facts of the case are very clear.\nQ: And just following up on that a bit. So you're not saying that the Justice Department should look into this, but you do believe that Comey did -- that his act of leaking those memos was illegal?\nMS. SANDERS: The Department of Justice has to look into any allegations of whether or not something is illegal or not. That's not up to me to decide. What I've said and what I'm talking about are facts. James Comey leaking of information, questionable statements under oath, politicizing an investigation -- those are real reasons for why he was fired. And the President's decision was 100 percent right, which we've said multiple times, over and over. And, in fact, I think the more and more we learn, the more and more that's been vindicated.\nQ: Okay, and just on another topic. Do you have any details on where the President will be going tomorrow in Florida? Any details on that trip?\nMS. SANDERS: He will be in the Naples and Fort Myers area. And as soon as those final details about specific stops are locked in, we'll certainly keep you guys posted.\nSarah.\nQ: Two questions. The first one, after meeting with Senator Scott, has the President's mind changed at all about that initial statement? Should he have been more forceful? And will he sign this bipartisan resolution condemning the violence in Charlottesville as well as hate groups like the KKK and neo-Nazis?\nMS. SANDERS: The President was clear in his initial statement that he condemned hatred, bigotry, racism of all forms. He continues to stick to that message. He's been very consistent in that fact. He and the Senator talked about that and discussed that, and agreed that that was the appropriate place to be.\nIn terms of whether or not he'll sign the joint resolution, absolutely. And he looks forward to doing so as soon as he receives it, which he hasn't done as I came out here earlier.\nQ: And then one other topic -- his meeting with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tonight. This is the kind of thing that conservatives who ran against him in the presidential race warned about, that he would be cutting deals with Chuck and Nancy that would not uphold the ideals of conservatives. So why is he meeting with just the two of them this evening? And is he hoping to strike an immigration deal with Schumer and Pelosi?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's pretty disingenuous for people to say he's only meeting with Democrats. The President is the leader of the Republican Party and was elected by Republicans. He beat out 16 other candidates to take that mantle on, and certainly, I think, is one of the strongest voices. And so the idea that the Republican Party ideas are not represented in that room is just ridiculous.\nJill.\nQ: Two topics, just to follow up on that firstly. Is immigration going to come up? And would the President consider reaching some kind of deal similar to the three-month extension working with Democrats on the DREAMers issue?\nMS. SANDERS: I wouldn't be surprised if it came up tonight, but I'm not going to get ahead of the conversations that are going to take place later this evening. And as always, we'll certainly keep you guys posted on what those look like.\nQ: And I also want to ask about the number two at FEMA withdrawing his nomination for consideration. Did the White House know about that IG audit when the President decided to nominate Daniel Craig?\nMS. SANDERS: We're not going to get into the back-and-forth. Our focus, particularly at FEMA right now, is on the safety and security of those that have been affected by the hurricane. We're not going to go down rabbit holes on personnel. And our focus is on that, as of right now.\nSteve.\nQ: This morning on CBS, Senator Manchin said that last night, at dinner, the President was adamant that the tax reform would not be a tax cut for the rich. Do you know on what basis the President was able to make that promise? Is he pledging to hold the top tax rate at 39.6 percent? Are we not going to see a reduction in that rate? How can he assure Americans that the rich won't get a tax cut?\nMS. SANDERS: The President's priority, when it comes to tax cuts and tax reform, is on the middle class -- helping grow the middle class, helping create jobs, simplifying the system. He's laid out those principles and that's where his focus is, and that's what he's going to push for as we move into this process.\nQ: Just to follow up on the question that was asked about Bernie Sanders's health plan -- in January, the President gave an interview with the Washington Post where he said he wanted to see a program that would allow for insurance for everybody, and that would leverage Medicare and Medicaid's ability to control drug prices. Bernie Sanders seems to be offering a plan that would do that. Why is the President not supporting him**?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm pretty sure that it's -- not only does the President not support it, but America doesn't support it, or Bernie Sanders would be sitting in the Oval Office right now. He pushed these ideas forward during the campaign; they were rejected, not just by America but Democrats. He didn't make it through the primary, he didn't make it into the Oval. I think that's a pretty clear indication of what America wants to see, and it's not a single-payer system.\nAlexis.\nQ: I'd like to ask --\nMS. SANDERS: I'll come back.\nQ: Thank you. Go ahead.\nQ: Two quick questions on tax reform. There are some Democrats who are confused. If the President was serious about creating a bipartisan tax plan, their thinking is that the President would also be meeting with ranking members or the minority members on Ways and Means and on the Finance Committee in advance of the disclosure of the consensus outline that's going to come out at the end of September. Can you describe the President's view about how to create a bipartisan tax plan? And does he want to get ideas from Democrats, or does he just want Democrats to buy into the plan that Brady and Hatch will reveal?\nMS. SANDERS: I think just by mere fact that he's been sitting down both yesterday and today with multiple members of the Democrat Party shows that he wants to have that conversation with them. I don't think you can make that any more clear than to have those ongoing conversations with multiple members of the Democrat Party.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah.\nQ: I said I had two questions. A quick question on Florida. How soon will the federal government be able to estimate with any kind of precision what kind of additional aid might be necessary to address the destruction in Florida in terms of what Congress may be presenting by the end of the month?\nMS. SANDERS: We're still in the recovery efforts right now, and until we get a little bit further into the process, it would be premature to put those estimates out there, particularly with precision. I would imagine that that takes us a good bit more time. And once we have those numbers, we'll let you know.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I'd like to ask -- the United States is spearheading a meeting at the U.N., on Monday, on U.N. reform. Could you give me some specifics on what the United States hopes to accomplish in that meeting?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get ahead of the meetings that are going to take place, but I can tell you that, on Friday, General McMaster and Ambassador Haley will be here at the briefing to talk in more detail about the U.N. General Assembly events and meetings that will take place next week.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. Two questions on two different subjects. Just to follow up to the President's meeting that he had with Senator Scott this morning -- after the President's response to that white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Senator Scott said that President Trump's moral authority was compromised. In terms of the conversation that they had, does the President understand what troubled Senator Scott, in regards to his response?\nMS. SANDERS: They had a very open and honest conversation, and committed to continuing those conversations and making sure that today was just the first step of many of those meetings where I think that will be an ongoing process and ongoing conversation that they have.\nQ: And then on tax reform, with the meeting that's taking place this evening with Democratic leaders from Congress, what has been the reaction that you've seen from the supporters that were onboard sort of the Trump bandwagon from the start, this new tack that the President is taking in reaching out to Democrats?\nMS. SANDERS: This was something that the President talked about on the campaign trail, of being a good dealmaker and being able to sit down with members of both sides, and be able to bring a deal and bring good legislation for the American people. This isn't new, and people listened and heard the President, and certainly supported him, and that's why he's here today.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two different questions on two subjects. First, your earlier remarks about the nature of repeal-and-replace legislation would seem to rule out the White House support for a flat-out repeal, which is favored by many Republican House members. Are you ruling out or discouraging a flat-out repeal measure first?\nMS. SANDERS: We haven't ruled out anything that helps move this process forward. We're grateful for the efforts that are continuing in Congress, and we hope that they do what they campaigned on and what they promised the American people they would do, and that's not just repeal, but it's also replace. I think both of those parts are very important moving forward.\nQ: The other thing is, the President recently appointed 42 new U.S. attorneys, and it's been reported fairly widely that only one of them was a woman -- the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Joyce Vance, former Democratic-appointed U.S. attorney in Alabama, called this -- and I quote -- \"a slap in the face.\" What is the reaction of the White House to that comment on this wave of appointees of U.S. attorneys?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the President has certainly surrounded himself with a lot of strong women in various positions, including myself in a pretty high position and senior position in the administration, as well as Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway, a number of others. He's continuing to add women to his staff at senior levels every single day, and I think that's a very positive step forward, considering -- particularly on the communications side, this is the first time in history that's happened.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. It was reported today that Mike Flynn, Jr. is the subject of a federal investigation into election meddling. Is the President concerned that someone who served on his transition team is now the subject of a federal investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a conversation with him about that, but I'd refer you to outside counsel on that.\nQ: If I could follow up on a comment that Hillary Clinton made this morning. She said that she wished President Trump was the President for all Americans. Do you have any reaction to this characterization of the President's role in the White House?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that type of misunderstanding of who this President is and, frankly, a misunderstanding of what he's been doing is exactly one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton is not the President and is instead pushing a book with a lot of false narratives and a lot of, I think, false accusations, and placing blame on a lot of other people instead of accepting it herself.\nPhilip.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. A little over a week ago, the Canada, U.S., and Mexico closed the second round -- closed out the second round of negotiations on NAFTA. The next round in 10 days is in Ottawa. Has the President been briefed on the second round? Is he happy with the result, if he was briefed? And is he still considering cancelling the entire agreement?\nMS. SANDERS: Those negotiations are still ongoing, and a final decision hasn't been made. And they're going to continue to push forward and make sure that the best deal possible for Americans and American workers happens.\nHallie.\nQ: Two questions. Number one, when was the last time the President spoke with Mike Flynn?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'm not aware of any conversation that's taken place in quite a long time.\nQ: And I also want to ask about tonight's dinner. Why not also invite Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, you've got the leader of the Republican Party sitting at the table. This is the President's opportunity to have a very open and honest conversation with members of the Senate. And I think anybody that tries to distort it into something other than that is just misunderstanding what the purpose is.\nQ: Can I just clarify -- because I don't want to get it wrong either. Are you saying that if Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan were there, then that conversation would be distorted?\nMS. SANDERS: That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that if anybody thinks that a Republican viewpoint isn't being represented is completely misunderstanding that the President is the leader of the Republican Party.\nQ: So is the President negotiating on behalf of the Republican leadership on the Hill in this meeting?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is negotiating on behalf of the American people exactly what he was elected to do. And the idea that you guys keep trying to distort this into a bad thing is, I think, exactly why this President was elected. They were sick and tired of business as usual. They wanted somebody who would break up the status quo, that would bring people from both sides of the table together to have conversations. This President has done more for bipartisanship in the last eight days than Obama did in eight years.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, I want to go to the Tim Scott meeting. What other topics were on the table with the President, beyond Charlottesville, with Tim Scott?\nMS. SANDERS: They talked about tax reform. They talked about moving to a -- looking at different ways to bring the country together and about continuing ongoing conversations, making sure that they stayed in constant contact with one another, and having a pretty open and regular conversation.\nQ: Were there conversations about HBCUs in this meeting?\nMS. SANDERS: HBCUs were not discussed in the meeting today.\nQ: Okay. And what about -- and a source is saying that there was a conversation about a request from black Republicans to have a high-ranking black Republican within this administration who knows issues and understands how Washington up and down Pennsylvania Avenue works. Was that a conversation in this meeting?\nMS. SANDERS: There's certainly conversations about adding additional personnel that can tap into the African American community. That did come up, yes.\nQ: So where did that go? What did the President say about --\nMS. SANDERS: A commitment to absolutely work with Senator Scott to look -- to do exactly that. And for the two of them to continue to have those conversations; for his viewpoints to continue to be expressed directly to the President.\nQ: Did they speak of certain issues, of certain people as it related to that topic about bringing new --\nMS. SANDERS: Specific people didn't come up.\nBlake.\nQ: Let me ask -- bring you back to taxes and a couple questions there. The President campaigned on a corporate tax rate of 15 percent. However, Steve Mnuchin yesterday said, \"I don't know if we will be able to achieve that given the budget issues.\" You were asked about Mr. Mnuchin's comments, and you said, \"The President is prepared to push for as low a rate as we can get.\" However, Mick Mulvaney said today that he had spoken to the President, and the President was adamant about a 15 percent rate.\nSo is the official position from the administration that a 15 percent rate needs to happen? Or that all of this is subject to negotiation?\nMS. SANDERS: The 15 percent has been the goal. It's always been the goal. We're going to continue pushing for that. That certainly hasn't changed.\nQ: And secondly, with working with -- or at least talking tonight with Pelosi and Schumer, one of the things that they want is Not One Penny, their campaign to the wealthiest Americans. That is a marker that they have drawn in the sand. At this point, is the President open to not having tax cuts as deep as once were maybe thought for the wealthiest of Americans?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, the President's focus has never been on the wealthiest of Americans. It's been on tax cuts for the middle class and tax reform as a whole. That continues to be his priority and will in tonight's discussion come through.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions, if I may. One is, just since you raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton's book having a false narrative and false accusations, could you point us to a couple specific accusations in the book that you believe are factually incorrect?\nMS. SANDERS: I think probably the biggest one is anyplace within the book where she lays blame for the loss on anyone but herself.\nQ: Okay. Can I ask just a follow-up, separate topic? The President issued a strong statement the other day on Myanmar and the persecution of the minority Muslim population. I know that topic came up in his meeting yesterday with the Malaysian. I'm wondering whether the President feels that Aung San Suu Kyi, as a figure of great moral stature and the de-facto leader of that country, should be more forthright in condemning what's happening in that part of her country.\nMS. SANDERS: I think anytime anyone sees something like that taking place, public condemnation is certainly appropriate. We're going to continue working with our allies and partners to be part of the process in whatever way we can, moving forward.\nDavid.\nQ: Yes, you mentioned a couple times today -- you've sort of emphasized diversity in the West Wing. You talked about the President being very clear after Charlottesville in denouncing all hate. I just wanted to read a comment from an influential African American sportscaster from ESPN yesterday, who said, \"Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself with other white supremacists. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy, period. He's unqualified and unfit to be President.\"\nWhy do you think -- do you have a reaction to that? And is the President aware of that comment?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if he's aware, but I think that's one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something that I think is a fire-able offense by ESPN.\nQ: If the President was so clear, as you said, why do you think influential African American figures are saying things like this?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to speak for that individual. But I know that the President has met, again, with people like Senator Scott who are highly respected leaders in the African American community. He's committed to working with them to bring the country together. I think that's where we need to be focused -- not on outrageous statements like that one.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You said before that the President has done more for bipartisanship in the last eight days than President Obama did in eight years. Are you basing that off of meetings that he's held with Democrats here at the White House?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm basing that on the fact that he's actually willing to sit down with members of the opposite party, something that President Obama rarely did, and certainly didn't listen to members of the opposite party. I can't think of a single time where he made a deal with anybody from the opposite side of -- from anybody beyond the Democrat Party.\nAnd again, this President is committed to doing that. He hasn't just done it once, but he's continuing to do that as we move into one of the most ambitious legislative agendas that we've had in a long time. And we're committed to working with Democrats. He's both stated that publicly and in these meetings that he's going to continue to have.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. Does the President believe it was a mistake not to have invested more time and energy in the Schumer-Pelosi relationship at an earlier stage in his term?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so. I think that right now we're at a critical time where we have some big things on the agenda -- tax reform, responsible immigration reform. He's committed to working, again, with both Republicans and Democrats to push those through, and hopes that they'll come on board to do that.\nThanks so much, guys. The President will be having an event here just momentarily. Thank you.\nEND 2:38 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-09-13", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a government has carried out the most assiduous narcotics control law enforcement measures.\nPursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements, and to take the measures required by section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included with this determination are justifications for the designations of Bolivia and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA.\nIn addition, the United States Government seriously considered designating Colombia as a country that has failed demonstrably to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements due to the extraordinary growth of coca cultivation and cocaine production over the past 3 years, including record cultivation during the last 12 months. Ultimately, Colombia is not designated because the Colombian National Police and Armed Forces are close law enforcement and security partners of the United States in the Western Hemisphere, they are improving interdiction efforts, and have restarted some eradication that they had significantly curtailed beginning in 2013. I will, however, keep this designation under section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA as an option, and expect Colombia to make significant progress in reducing coca cultivation and production of cocaine.\nI have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid the people of Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.\nYou are hereby authorized and directed to submit this designation, with its Bolivia and Venezuela memoranda of justification, under section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

It's a very special evening.\nAnd I want to thank Melania for working with her friends in the room to make this so very, very unique and, again, very, very special.\nThis is a house like no other. It's a house that encumbers so many different titles, from beauty to warmth to power, sometimes to coldness -- I've heard that. (Laughter.) But it's an amazing, incredible place.\nAnd to have the White House Historical Association and all of our board members and everybody involved, and to raise all of the money that we've raised tonight, we just want to thank you very much.\nWe just got back from Florida. It's been a rough time for Florida. But the first responders and the Coast Guard, and to all of the people -- FEMA -- all of the people that worked so hard have done an A-plus job.\nYou know, we had -- as you know very well, some of you are from Texas and some of you are from Florida. And you both got hit. In Texas you got hit with the largest amount of water anybody has ever seen. I guess the largest ever recorded. And in Florida you got hit with the strongest winds ever recorded. It actually hit the Keys with a -- it was a Category 5. I never even knew a Category 5 existed. And they suffered greatly.\nBut in both bases, and in other cases such as Alabama, Louisiana, and plenty of others -- Puerto Rico; the Virgin Islands was hit brutally, brutally. It got hit dead center with a strong five. And it's almost not standing, but the people are standing. And some incredible things have happened.\nBut I just want to turn it over to Melania. This is, again, a place that I've grown to love and respect. You go to the Oval Office, and I've had the biggest men -- we have some of the biggest businesspeople, men and women. I must say, some of the women are bigger than the men -- (laughter) -- but I won't say it too loudly. I'm actually impressed with some of the women far more than some of the men, but that's okay.\nBut I've had the biggest men and women from business and other fields come into the Oval Office. And they have magnificent offices, they have beautiful offices on the best -- 5th Avenue and Park Avenue, the best locations. Most beautiful places you've ever seen. And they walk into that Oval Office and they think that there's nothing like it -- and there really is nothing like it.\nSo even Phil Ruffin and Richard LeFrak, and where's my Howard? Howard and -- there he is. And you're looking good, Howard. You had a rough bout, and now you're a thousand percent. So it's good to have you back with us. But we have so many friends.\nAnd again, thank you very much. Thank you for all you do. And I'm going to just turn this over to the star of the Trump family. She's become the big -- they love her out there, I'll tell you. I was -- we walked all over Florida, we walked all over Texas, and they're loving Melania. And she just enjoys helping out with what she's doing and working with you folks.\nSo thank you all very much. Fantastic honor.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128266", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Fort Myers, Florida\n10:10 A.M. EDT\nMS. WALTERS: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to quickly run through what the President will be doing on the ground in Florida when we arrive before I take your questions here.\nWhen we land in Fort Myers, the President will be greeted by FEMA Administrator Brock Long, Governor Rick Scott and his wife, Ann, Senator Marco Rubio, and Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nThe President will then receive a briefing on Hurricane Irma relief efforts by FEMA, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. National Guard, and local first responders and volunteers.\nHe will then lift to Naples where he, along with the Vice President, Secretary Perry, Acting Secretary Duke, Administrator Long, Senator Rubio, Representative Diaz-Balart, will visit a neighborhood that was devastated by the hurricane and meet with storm survivors.\nAfter that, he will return to Fort Myers and depart for Washington, D.C. And with that, I will take your questions.\nQ: So is there a deal or is there not a deal on DACA? Who's right here?\nMS. WALTERS: The President made that pretty clear this morning that there is no deal. There was a constructive conversation last night with the Democratic minority leaders, but there was no deal made.\nQ: Isn't this issue of \"agreement\" or \"deal\" semantics? Do you see a difference between \"agreement\" and \"deal\" if those words are used?\nMS. WALTERS: What I can tell you is that a deal was not reached. There was a conversation on the legislative priorities for the fall, which include tax reform, infrastructure, and DACA. But by no means was any deal ever reached last night.\nQ: So was an agreement reached?\nMS. WALTERS: There was, as I said, a constructive conversation to move forward. In terms of DACA, which is important to the minority leaders, this is something that Congress needs to work on. They need to continue to have constructive conversations amongst themselves to figure out what they're going to do to enable real and responsible immigration reform, and bring that to the President's desk before the six-month window expires.\nThe President has made it clear that he's willing to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats and Republicans alike. He wants to have bipartisan support. You saw that through the different various meetings and dinner this week. And he'll continue to do that. But this notion that a deal was made -- to have the minority leaders say that -- you've seen them have to go back and re-amend their statement from last night -- just shows that it's silly. There was no deal met, and they know that.\nQ: How do you respond to the criticism -- there's a lot of criticism coming that he's offering amnesty. You're seeing on Breitbart they're calling him \"Amnesty Don.\" How does he respond to those critiques from the right?\nMS. WALTERS: The President has been clear in the past that there will be no amnesty. The Trump administration will not be discussing amnesty. What the Trump administration will discuss is a responsible path forward in immigration reform. That could include legal citizenship over a period of time. But absolutely by no means will this White House discuss amnesty, and the President has made it clear how he feels about no amnesty.\nBut again, this is Congress. Congress needs to put together what they're going to do before the six-month window runs out and bring it to the President. And this falls back on Congress. The President has encouraged the Republicans and Democrats to come together to have real immigration reform that is legal and substantial.\nQ: How do you define amnesty?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to sit here and litigate what the definition of amnesty is. What I will tell you is the President has made it clear that he does not support amnesty. I think I was clear when I said that --\nQ: You weren't clear. You said that he could support a path forward to citizenship. That is the definition of amnesty to many, many Republicans, especially in the House.\nMS. WALTERS: Again, I'm not going sit here and litigate what the definition of amnesty is, what I will tell you is right now Congress needs to focus on getting real immigration reform to move forward so that there is a legal path forward instead of right now. DACA was illegal. The President took the responsible action, and now this is in the hands of Congress to put something on the President's desk.\nQ: Did the President agree not to push for border wall funding as part of a DACA deal?\nMS. WALTERS: The President made it very clear that we will need to have massive border security. You heard him say this again this morning. That was made clear in the meeting last night that there will be massive border security included in any agreement that is eventually met.\nQ: What does that include, Lindsay? If not a wall, what does massive border security include?\nMS. WALTERS: The President has been clear that there will be a wall. A wall is part of massive border security, but we need to ensure that we are having -- as he ran before that there will be border security. We need to secure our borders and protect the American people. The wall is very much still in play, and the President has been clear that we need to have massive border security. You heard him say that this morning; you heard the Democrats walk back their statement.\nQ: So why remove -- why separate the wall and DACA in the negotiations? A lot of people would say that taking the wall out really takes away a leverage point for him in terms of getting something from Democrats.\nMS. WALTERS: We haven't said yet where the wall funding is being tied to, what vehicle. It's too premature at this point to say where that funding vehicle will be tied in. Right now the President is focused on massive border security, as well as getting a wall.\nBut what we need to -- the Democrats are pushing DACA. They need to look at their colleagues in the Congress and work with them to put something in front of the President that's responsible immigration reform.\nQ: What is this -- what is this massive border security that the President is looking for immediately?\nMS. WALTERS: There are several ways you can have massive border security. I will let DHS speak more to that, but I can tell you that massive -- securing our borders is very important to this President. We will still have a wall. He has not backed down from that wall or a structure being on the southern border. And we'll continue to keep you abreast as developments --\nQ: Several Democrats in the meeting yesterday at the White House, the bipartisan meeting, came out in the White House driveway and said on the record that the President was very clear that the border wall would not need to be tied to the DACA bill, that they would be separate. And they made clear they would not tie those two together, and the President reiterated that he agreed. Is that true?\nMS. WALTERS: What I said to you earlier is it's too premature to say what vehicle the funding for the wall will be tied to at this time.\nQ: But the President made clear in the meeting, according to all these Democrats, not -- even before the Pelosi and Schumer meeting -- that it may be too early to tell where the border wall money would be, but it would in a separate bill from DACA. Are they wrong?\nMS. WALTERS: The President has made clear that we need to have massive border security in whatever deal is made regarding DACA, and that's what we will move forward on.\nQ: One more on the wall. Nancy Pelosi said in her statement that both sides agreed that the White House and Democratic leaders would work out a border security package. Is that your understanding that it's going to be the Democrats and the White House putting together the border security package and basically cutting out Republicans from the process?\nMS. WALTERS: Republicans will not be cut out from this process. The President said this morning that the Republican leaders are all aware. This is a process that will work through both Republicans and Democrats. The President wants this to be a bipartisan effort, and that's what we will focus on -- it being a bipartisan effort with both the Democrats and the Republicans.\nQ: Then why weren't Ryan and McConnell in the meeting last night to talk about DACA?\nMS. WALTERS: The President is leader of the Republican Party. He was having dinner with the minority leaders on the Democratic side. He speaks frequently to the other Republican leaders, and that doesn't -- I wouldn't look into who was and who wasn't. This is not a tit-for-tat on who attended the dinner last night.\nQ: How do you respond to Representative Steve King who said that the Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair and no promise is credible?\nMS. WALTERS: I can't speak -- I'll let Representative King speak for himself. What I can tell you is that the President has made it clear what his priorities are this fall. We need to get tax reform. We need to have real and responsible -- sensible immigration reform.\nAnd that's what he's focused on. He's focused on reaching across the aisle and working with both parties, both Republicans and Democrats, to get real solutions for the American people. The American people elected him to do this for our country, and that's what he's doing. He's working across the aisle and looking to cut deals with both parties in the benefit of the American people.\nQ: Can I ask about taxes? What did the President mean yesterday when he said taxes for the wealthy may have to go higher?\nMS. WALTERS: We're still in the early forms of tax reform. We've made it clear there are four principles in tax reform: We need to make it easier, make it fair, win again, and bring it home.\nThe President, as well as his senior principals, are continuing to meet with leaders on the Hill to discuss tax reform. This is a high priority. We need to be able to bring jobs back to the American shores and have a tax reform plan that works for the middle-class, working Americans.\nWith that, because we're about to land, I want to introduce --\nQ: The plans that we've seen so far from the White House would lower the rate for individuals. Is the President talking about raising rates for some income levels with his comments about the wealthy?\nMS. WALTERS: The President said his comments yesterday, he was clear in what he said about tax reform for the wealthy. What I can tell you is right now we're going through a process of determining what is the most reasonable tax reform for the American -- that will benefit the American people; that will grow the economy; put more money back in the pockets of everyday citizens and bring jobs back.\nQ: He won't rule out raising rates on the wealthy?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to commit to anything at this time. I do need to introduce John Daly, who is going to give an update on the hurricane as we're about to land here and what the recovery-relief efforts are.\nQ: Can I just clear up one thing you said earlier? Just I'm just trying to make sure I understand. You said at one point the words \"path the citizenship\" and indicated that this White House, this President will be open to some sort of path to citizenship. You weren't specific about for who or how many people. But is that true that this President would consider a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants?\nMS. WALTERS: You're parsing what I said. What I said is that the President does not support amnesty. This White House will -- the administration will not discuss amnesty, but that it's in the hands of Congress to come up with a real and responsible immigration reform and a path forward. And when you pushed on the amnesty and the definition of amnesty, what I was saying to you is that in a real and responsible path forward there are many different options. One, for example -- not committing to but as an example -- could be a program that over a set period of time through a certain -- through a program and a process that you could eventually.\nBut again, this is in Congress. They need to come back. The White House is not leading --\nQ: You could eventually have a path to citizenship --\nMS. WALTERS: You are parsing my words. The White House is not leading this effort. We need Congress to work together to come to the President to say what their immigration policy is moving forward, and we'll review it then. I'm not going into any further details.\nMR. DALY: Hi, I'm John Daly. I'm the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor.\nSince we're going to be landing here shortly, I want to give you a little bit more detail about today's trip with respect to the President's meeting with local officials, emergency responders, and survivors from Hurricane Irma.\nAs you know, our commitment right now is still on the life-sustaining activities and recovery operations. There are still some search-and-rescue efforts underway as well, particularly in areas of Florida that might see some flooding and the rivers that still have not crested.\nThe immediate threats from Irma with respect to heavy rains and flooding may have surpassed or passed us already, but there are still some concerns that we need to be thinking about with respect to the survivors that were left in the wake of the storm.\nThe President has made clear his commitment that the entire federal government is here to support the Governor of Florida, as well the Governors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as they execute their recovery efforts.\nWith respect to our priorities over the next couple of days, power is a significant issue, particularly in power restoration in Florida. The last three days have been an excellent response by the electricity subsector to get power back turned on.\nOn September 11th, at the peak of the power loss, there were about 7.8 million customers that did not have power. That number is down to 3.6 million in less than three days. So great effort by everybody involved to get power restored. That's an important step towards the recovery efforts.\nIn addition to power, there's a lot of discussions about fuel. The Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Duke extended the Jones Act waiver, which allows for fuel to be brought into the state of Florida more readily.\nOn Tuesday, 12 million gallons were actually delivered to the port of Tampa, 18 million gallons to Port Everglades, and those fuels will be actually trucked into key areas within the state that are currently short of fuel.\nAs far as Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, please keep in mind that they are still in the recovery mode as well. Ninety-two percent of the power in Puerto Rico has been restored. Governor Rossellт and Governor Mapp meet with FEMA Administrator Brock Long yesterday during his visits down to the islands, and Governor Rossellт is at the White House today meeting with officials, including Mr. Tom Bossert, the Homeland Security Advisor, to work through some recovery plans for the next few weeks.\nI'll stop there with any questions that you like.\nQ: Is there any value in the President going to the Virgin Islands?\nMR. DALY: Yeah I won't speak to the Virgin Islands opportunity. I think there's a -- the key thing today is for the President to meet and focus on the survivors here in Florida and meet with the emergency officials, the state officials, and the first responders and volunteers who have done amazing work to actually help our fellow citizens. That will be the focus today. We'll look at the Virgin Islands later and make that determination at that time.\nQ: We've heard in the Virgin Islands, that they're not going to have the sustained attention. Can you assure that the people there -- that the United States government is totally committed to helping with their recovery?\nMR. DALY: Absolutely, the President has been very clear that he is committed to expecting all the members of the Cabinet to provide all resources necessary to support all of the locations that have been impacted, including the territories. For example, Department of Defense has been -- and the State Department actively involved in getting resources down to the Caribbean, not only for the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, but also other foreign nations down there that need assistance.\nDOD has marshaled unprecedented levels of resources to provide that support, including evacuating people from the islands that needed it for medical reasons. So yes, the President is committed to providing the support to the Virgin Islands -- to the recovery efforts.\nQ: What specifically will the President see in the areas he's going to today?\nMR. DALY: So the first stop will actually be meeting with the state officials, local officials, the people who are really getting the job done, including the Governor and his team, and the first responders and the volunteers. After that, we'll make a trip down to Naples where the President will spend some time meeting with survivors -- a neighborhood that was directly impacted by the storm.\nUnfortunately, as we throw numbers around, we have to remember that every person that's impacted is just that, they're impacted. And it's important to them to see the President's support, to see the Cabinet's support, to see the federal government's support.\nWe have over 40,000 federal employees deployed to support Irma -- victims right now in the state of Florida. Over 7 million meals have been deployed, commodities have been deployed. And the President will have the opportunity to meet with some of those survivors and hear some of their personal stories.\nQ: The President proposed cuts to FEMA's grant programs. Do you think he's reconsidering that in the wake of what he's seeing in Texas and now here?\nMR. DALY: The good thing is that FEMA is in a good position right now to provide all the level of support that's needed for the request, not only from the governors of the impacted areas for Irma, but also the Governors of Texas and Louisiana.\nQ: Do you favor more money, though, and keep that money -- increase the budget?\nMR. DALY: (Inaudible) why I want to focus on the visit today, and the visit today is about the survivors and making sure that the folks are getting what they need in order to be able to get back on their feet. The President's message is going to be very clear today that the President of the United States, his entire federal workforce, all of his Cabinet are here to support the Governor, the state and local officials in order to be able to ensure that we recover appropriately and restore normalcy back to post-Irma.\nQ: (Inaudible) for the rest of it, when people will be able to get down to the Lower Keys?\nMR. DALY: So, the actual inspections were done on the actual roadways of the Keys, I'll leave it to the state and local officials to make a determination on that.\nThe bottom line is that, remember, there are still threats to individual safety. So the message that we need to give the American people, particularly the Floridians that are returning to their homes, is that they need to listen to their state and local officials, the local officials in particular, on when it's safe to return. It may look like there may not be threats, but in actuality with downed power lines, with standing water, there are still threats to people's safety. It's imperative people listen to the messages of their state and local officials.\nMS. WALTERS: Thank you, guys.\nEND 10:27 A.M.

Thank you for being the rock. (Applause.)\nThank you for bringing your faith and your love of your neighbors to this ministry. I want to -- join me in thanking Pastor Freddy Lagos for his wonderful ministry, his testimony. (Applause.) I think you can do better than that. (Applause.)\nThank you, Pastor. And thank you -- there's several ministries represented here. Join me in thanking all the churches that are involved here and involved in other places across Florida, and join me in thanking Feed the Hungry for being here. (Applause.)\nI just left President Donald Trump who sent me here to tell you a simple word, to the people of Collier County, to the people of Florida, we are with you. The American people are with you. We're with you today, we'll be with you tomorrow, and we'll be with you every day until this community recovers and rebuilds bigger and better than ever before. (Applause.)\nWe will be able to do that because of public support from great leaders like those you just heard from. Senator Marco Rubio, Congressman Diaz-Balart, and Congressman Rooney -- I know they are going to support efforts on an ongoing basis to make sure that Florida and the families of these communities have the resources and support that you need to rebuild. Join me in thanking them in advance for that support and for their great leadership. (Applause.)\nI'm confident, as well, because I must tell you -- and I know President Trump feels just the same way -- Florida has inspired the nation. Hurricane Irma did her worst and Florida brought her best. We commend Governor Rick Scott. We commend all the great first responders and law enforcement and public safety who've been there every step of the way. (Applause.)\nAnd we thank you for your courage and your service to this community. We're also proud of all the men and women in uniform and the Coast Guard and Homeland Security and in FEMA who've leaned into the effort to be there for your families.\nBut let me say to anyone that's looking on, to families that have been impacted by this storm. The American people have not only provided those at every level of government to come alongside, but there are resources available. And if your family has been impacted, or if you know a family that's been impacted, please make sure that they take the opportunity to sign-up at DisasterAssistance.gov.\nThe easiest way to do it is online or call FEMA's 1-800 number. We've already -- tens of thousands of people have begun to get signed up for the resources that are available.\nOur nation has made it possible to provide for families and communities in extraordinary events like Hurricane Irma. And we want you to encourage all of your neighbors and friends.\nThe need will be great. The support will be there. But it will ultimately -- I truly believe, and it's why the President wanted me to come here today before I return to Washington, D.C. -- the President and I know that ultimately these communities will be rebuilt on the generosity and the kindness of communities of faith and neighbors and friends like all of you that are gathered here today. And I want to thank you for that (Applause.)\nWe saw it in Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. The President and I have seen it today in the wake of Hurricane Irma, that many of you who -- I know your own homes and your own families have been effected by this storm, but, Pastor, they're still out here. They're still coming alongside neighbors and friends.\nThank you for being the hands and feet of my savior. Thank you for putting your faith into practice. And I just want to encourage you in the days ahead to continue to provide the time and the talent and the treasure necessary. Because I'm confident with the support of the great leadership that you have here in Florida, with the support that we'll all make sure that the American people provide from our nation's capital, with the great work of our law enforcement and public safety community, and with your help and with God's help, the best days for Collier County and all of Florida are yet to come.\nThank you very much for your work and your inspiring efforts.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128268", "text": "Q: What I'm wondering, Mr. President, is that Susan Rice has finally come out and said that she did unmask officials in your campaign, and I'm wondering what your reaction is.\nTHE PRESIDENT: She's not supposed to be doing that, and what she did was wrong. And we've been saying that, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. What she did was wrong. Not supposed to be doing that. You know it. The unmasking and the surveillance, and I heard she admitted that yesterday. Just not right.\nLet's go, folks. We'll go a few more. Go ahead. Anybody have any questions?\nQ: What did you think of the trip today -- handing out the sandwiches?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think the Governor has done a great job. I think the federal government, working with state and local, has really done a terrific job.\nNow, the Keys -- we've just gotten word on the Keys. That was just wiped out. That was a hurricane 5 hit it. But we're getting tremendous amounts of supplies, and medical, and a lot of other things out to the Keys.\nBut for the most part, the electric is going back on. It's already on in certain locations like Miami, but it's going back on on a daily basis. We have massive amounts of electricians, massive amounts of electrical workers all over the state. They came from all over the country. They came from Canada -- as far away as Canada.\nThere's never been a mobilization of electrical workers like we have in the state of Florida, and it's going on very rapidly. Much of it is already on.\nQ: Are you going to the Virgin Islands?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'll be going to the Virgin Islands. This next week, as you know, is United Nations. And I'm going to be going to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico sometime the end of next week or the following week.\nI spoke to both governors. We've got it very well covered. Virgin Islands was really hit. They were hit about as hard as I've ever seen. But the Virgin Islands were hit. But I'll be going there at the end of the week or the beginning of the following week.\nI'll also be going to Puerto Rico the same day.\nQ: You mentioned United Nations next week. Your administration has undertaken a review of the Iran deal. Will you be announcing --\nTHE PRESIDENT: A review of --\nQ: Of the Iran deal. I'm wondering if you will be announcing, or if you can tell us, give us a hint about whether you will make any decisions about adding more sanctions on Iran or even pulling out.\nTHE PRESIDENT: You'll see what I'm going to be doing very shortly in October. But I will say this: The Iran deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen. Certainly, at a minimum, the spirit of the deal is just atrociously kept, but the Iran deal is not a fair deal to this country. It's a deal that should have never, ever been made. And you'll see what we're doing in a couple of weeks. It's going to be in October.\nQ: Some major action, you think, by your administration?\nTHE PRESIDENT: You'll see. You're going to see. But we are not going to stand for what they're doing to this country. They have violated so many different elements, but they've also violated the spirit of that deal. And you will see what we'll be doing in October. It will be very evident.\nQ: What do you say to Republicans who are looking at your outreach to Democrats and saying, \"What's going on here\"?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, many Republicans really like it. As you know, I was with a great Republican representative just now, who you know very well -- two of them -- and they are very, very happy with what I'm doing. And I'm a Republican through and through, but I'm also finding that sometimes to get things through, it's not working that way.\nAnd, you know, we got very poorly treated on the healthcare plan, and now you see what's happening where people are going single-payer -- exactly what I said would happen. And single-payer would be a terrible thing for our country.\nSo my relationship with the Republicans is excellent. Many of them agree with what I'm doing. You just saw two -- Mario -- you know who I'm talking about -- we just met with two great Republican representatives who love what I'm doing.\nBut we have to get things passed, and if we can't get things passed then we have to go a different route. We have to get things passed.\nNow, you've covered my statement very accurately on the dinner last night, and they cannot obstruct for a wall because we definitely need a wall. I just spoke, by the way, to the President of Mexico, and, as you know, it's been impossible to reach him because he was in the mountains where they had the earthquake, and there was no cell.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And as you know, it's been impossible to reach him because of the -- he was in the mountains where they had the earth quack and there was no cell. We spoke yesterday but the phone, the connection never got put together because he had no access to cell. But we just had a good talk -- just got finished with him.\nAnd that whole earthquake is terrible, it's just terrible. So we paid our respects, and he, likewise, also paid his respects with respect to Irma and Harvey.\nQ: What is your response to Steven Mnuchin seeking a government plane, or looking into having a government plane take him --\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't know anything about it. I just heard about it.\nQ: Do you think it's inappropriate?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I doubt he would do it. I've known him a long time, he is a very straight shooter. So it could be that he used a plane and he's paying for it. I don't know anything about it, I really don't. I just heard about it a little while ago.\nQ: And do you have full confidence in Mnuchin and Cohn?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Total confidence. I've known him for a long time. He's a very honorable man.\nQ: How about Gary Cohn?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I have confidence in Gary, too.\nQ: You met yesterday with Senator Tim Scott. He seemed to go back to the Hill and suggest to reporters there that he expressed some frustration about the way you had handled the aftermath of Charlottesville and maybe even pressed to add some more African Americans in senior ranks in your administration -- African American Republicans. Were those things discussed? Can you tell us a little bit more about how you reacted?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Tim Scott has been a friend of mine for a long time. I've been a supporter of his when I was civilian. I was one of his earliest supporters, and I supported him when he ran.\nAnd we had a great talk yesterday. I think especially in light of the advent of Antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. And essentially that's what I said.\nNow because of what's happened since then, with Antifa, you look at, you know, really what's happened since Charlottesville -- a lot of people are saying -- in fact a lot of people have actually written, \"gee Trump might have a point.\" I said, you got some very bad people on the other side also, which is true.\nBut we had a great conversation and he also has legislation, which I actually like very much -- the concept of which, I support -- to get people going into certain areas and building and constructing and putting people to work. And I told him yesterday, that's a concept I could support very easily.\nQ: Did he ask you to make any additions to high-ranking diversity or African Americans to the inner circle and to the White House staff?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We did talk about that, yeah.\nQ: Did you make any promises? What do you think about it?\nTHE PRESIDENT: By the way, it's something I do. But it's something I certainly would continue to do, and we did talk about that.\nQ: Did you make some promises in that regard to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I would do it. I told him I would do it. He knows --\nQ: Did he give you a list of names?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me finish. He knows we've already done it. But I told Tim, and I told him very strongly, I like that and I also like very much legislation having to do with jobs, in certain areas.\nQ: Can I come back on making deals for a second? Come back on making deals?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.\nQ: Marc Short said the other day that you learned from the Obamacare process that you can't count on members of your own party to get your legislation across the goal line. Is that true? Do you share that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will give you a great example. So we had a surprise from John McCain, and we had the vote and then John McCain came out of nowhere. And we had a surprise. It was a very unpleasant surprise, and now what are we looking at?\nWe have people now talking about single-payer, and that's what we get. So the Republicans have to stick together better. They had the votes and then John McCain changed his mind, pure and simple.\nAnd if the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to do more and more. And by the way, the Republican Party agrees with me. The people out there definitely agree with me. If they're unable to stick together then I'm going to have to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.\nFor the tax bill, I would be very surprised if I don't have at least a few Democrats. I have states that I won by 30 points and more, where they have people running. And, frankly, I think and I get the impression that they very much like the ideas of this tax plan.\nWe'll be submitting on the week of the 25th, the detailed -- everything -- but most of -- most people know about the plan in terms of the details. But we'll actually be opening up the week of the 25th. And I think it's going to be something that's going to be very successful, and I do believe we'll have some Democratic votes.\nQ: Mr. President, on the tax plan, most Democrats have said that if the 1 percent gets a tax cut, they will be against it. Can you confirm whether or not the 1 percent will get a tax cut?\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is not a plan for the rich. This is a plan for the middle class, and this is a plan for jobs, and this is a plan to bring $4 trillion back into the United States that people have wanted to do for years, both Democrat and Republican. For years they've wanted to bring that money back into the United States.\nThis is a plan to bring -- it could be more than $4 trillion. Frankly, nobody really knows what the number is. They've been saying for years it's $2.5 trillion, but that was -- for four years I've been hearing that, so obviously it's much more.\nI think it's anywhere between $4 trillion and $5 trillion -- could even be more than that. We'll be bringing that back into the United States. I will have tremendous Democrat support and Republican support for that.\nQ: Will it be a revenue-neutral plan?\nTHE PRESIDENT: It will be revenue-neutral when you add growth because we're going to have magnificent growth. If you look at GDP for the last quarter, it was 3 percent. Everybody was shocked to see that. I think we would have had, I'm not going to use numbers, but I think we would have had substantially more than that for the next quarter in GDP. The problem is we just got hit with two massive hurricanes, the likes of which we essentially haven't seen before. So that will have a little bit of an impact and maybe more than a little bit of an impact.\nBut we have GDP -- if you raise -- if you go up one point in GDP, it takes care of many sins. If you go up two points, it takes care of everything. And I think we're going to rocket in terms of GDP.\nAnd don't forget, I've been saying for a long time that GDP is going to be higher than you thought, when GDP -- when it hit 3 percent this last quarter, people, including many of the people here, were very, very surprised because they thought it would be about 1.7 percent or 1.8 percent. A lot of it has to do with all of the regulations I've cut where people can actually now go out and build and farm and do all the things they want to do, at the same time being environmentally friendly and regulation friendly.\nSo I just want to say including growth -- because it's a very fair question, a good question -- if you want to include growth, because we're going to go like a rocket ship, we're going to more than make up the difference.\nQ: Mr. President, the severity of these storms -- the one in Florida, the one in Texas -- has that made you rethink your views of climate change?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we've had bigger storms than this. And if you go back into the 1930s and the 1940s, and you take a look, we've had storms over the years that have been bigger than this. If you go back into the Teens, you'll see storms that were as big or bigger. So we did have two horrific storms, epic storms. But if you go back into the '30s and '40s, and you go back into the Teens, you'll see storms that were very similar and even bigger, okay?\nQ: Speaking of growth, the Federal Reserve, are you thinking about the next chairman? Do you want to keep Chairman Yellen? Are you thinking Gary Cohn for that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I do respect Chairman Yellen a lot. I like her and I respect her, but I haven't made that decision yet. I do think this: The country is doing well. We got hurt by the two hurricanes, but the country is doing very well. The stock market has hit a new high, as you see. Jobs are at a 17-year low. Unemployment is at the highest number it's ever been -- if you look at the unemployment is low, and the employment in the country is just about at the highest point it's ever been. I mean, we're doing well.\nAnd very importantly just to finish, companies are starting to move back into our country. Expansion of auto firms and plants; expansion of different things -- even Foxconn. I'm looking at your iPhone. It's made by you know who -- Foxconn. And Foxconn is moving into the country for the first time. Apple is going to be building massive plants. And there's a big reason for that, and the reason happens to be Trump.\nHave a good time, everybody.\nQ: It looks like the bomb was bigger than initially thought --\nTHE PRESIDENT: What was?\nQ: The bomb that North Korea exploded might have been two or three times as big. It looks like they might be making preparations for another blast. You've been reaching out to Xi Jinping. Where are you now with North Korea?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We have a very good relationship with China and with the President of China. We are working on different things. I can't tell you, obviously, what I'm working on. But believe me, the people of this country will be very, very safe.\nI think that a lot of effort is being put into this. We're looking at what's going on. As we speak, we are literally at it right now, and you will be seeing what we'll be doing?\nQ: Are you going to visit China this fall in November in that Asia trip?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Probably be visiting. I was invited by the President. We'll probably all be going over as a group sometime in November.\nQ: You mean China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: And we'll be doing --\nQ: Japan.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Japan, South Korea, possibly Vietnam with a conference. Okay?\nQ: What about the Philippines for that ASEAN conference?\nTHE PRESIDENT: He invited us, we're going to see.\nQ: You mean South Korea, China, and Japan for sure?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right now definite. We've been invited by the Philippines. They want us to go -- Vietnam -- to the conference.\nQ: -- trade conference, you think?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We'll possibly do that. It will be a busy 10 days, okay? Keep you guys busy.\nQ: Back in time for Thanksgiving?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I hope so. (Laughter.) I don't know, but I hope so. Thank you. Thank you.

I came down to see FEMA, to see the Coast Guard, to see the Army, the Marines, everybody, the Navy. The job that everybody has done is incredible.\nAnd I know you're also in the process, but to think of the incredible power of that storm. And while people unfortunately passed, it was such a small number that nobody would have -- people thought thousands and thousands of people may have their lives ended. And the number is a very small number which is a great tribute to you.\nAlso with the fact that I know in the case of FEMA and the case of Coast Guard, the job you've done in saving people, saving lives. As an example, in Harvey in Texas, we talked -- over 16,000 lives. Nobody would even understand that, it's on you -- even imagine -- and down here the same thing.\nSo I want to thank everybody. You guys have been -- I don't want to see you next week in another disaster. (Laughter.) We've seen you enough.\nBut I just want to thank everybody, the first responders, on behalf of myself, our Vice President. Melania really wanted to be with us, she's really -- it has really touched her heart what's gone on.\nAnd we've seen the devastation. We're going to see some more of it now unfortunately, and I have to say that your Governor -- where is our Governor here? Rick Scott. (Applause.) The job he has done is incredible, and I guess I've been very lucky because you know you have a great Governor in Texas, you have a great Governor in Florida. The job that Rick has done is being talked about all over.\nAnd to think that -- and I must say, Florida Power & Light -- where's Eric? Eric. Where's Eric? Eric, great job. (Applause.) I will say they're way ahead of schedule. There are more electrical people in this state, I think, than ever accumulated anywhere in the world is what I read before. It's from all over the country they came and I've never seen -- you've never seen anything --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: No, we haven't.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Mobilized all over. I see Pam Bondi, who has done such an incredible job stopping certain little problems before they start and actually getting some of the companies to put up a lot of money. So the Attorney General, I want to thank you, Pam. Fantastic job. (Applause.)\nElaine -- where's Elaine Duke? Elaine Duke and -- where's our Brock? Don't lose him, okay, Elaine. (Laughter.) I have to say that Brock, working with your Governor, working with Pam, working with Elaine, working, by the way, with Marco Rubio, who is around here somewhere. (Applause.)\nIt's a team like very few people have seen, and I want to thank everybody. Marco, I want to thank you a lot, you were really helpful. And I just -- again I have to say that, what do I know? But I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate. I don't know what he's going to do. (Laughter) But I know that at a certain point it ends for you, and we can't let it end. So I hope he runs for Senate. (Applause.)\nAgain, I came down to say hello to you folks and to say hello to you folks. And the First Lady and myself, this is an honor for us to be here. We're now going to tour some of the areas.\nAnd, as Rick said, we have been very, very fast, and we had to be. We were signing papers as the storm was coming in, and that's never happened before. But Rick, thank you very much, really great job. And Brock, everybody, thank you very much. You have a great -- Rick Perry here. (Applause.)\nWe have Linda McMahon, we have so many people, so many of the Cabinet members because they're going to help. I want to thank Mike Pence. In fact, I'd like you to say a few words.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I would be happy to. Thank you, Mr. President, First Lady. It's an honor to be with you today just to pay a debt of gratitude for the great leadership here at the state and local level.\nI know the President directed the full resources of the federal government in support of Florida's effort to prepare for it, confront, and now recovery and rebuild from Hurricane Irma. The President's directive over this weekend was very clear: Wherever Hurricane Irma goes, we're going to be there first.\nAnd thanks to the great leadership of your Governor, and your emergency management team, and all the great first responders on the ground, that's exactly what Florida did.\nAnd as the President has said, we're with you today, we're going to be with you tomorrow, and we're going to be with you until Florida rebuilds bigger and better than ever before. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: One word on a very important subject, so your power is, I mean literally, Rick, it's going on as we speak. It's going way ahead of schedule -- weeks ahead of schedule. And most of it, I guess outside of the Keys, where we have a very special problem, but we're working hard on that. That's a very, very special problem. That was just dead-center, but we're working very hard on that. And we have a lot of goods out there, a lot of water, a lot of food, a lot of everything.\nBut I'd like to ask your Governor to say a few words. Again, he's been absolutely outstanding. Thank you. Rick.\nGOVERNOR SCOTT: Well first off, I want to thank everybody for their prayers. We've got prayers all over the world. I want to thank everybody for doing everything they can to get us back.\nI want to thank the President and the Vice President. What I can say is, they were always accessible. They made quick decisions. They surrounded themselves with outstanding people. They were constantly calling me to say what resources did we need.\nI want to thank basically the entire military. I want to thank the Coast Guard and the Navy. (Applause.)\nI want to thank Secretary Duke. I want to thank Administrator Long. They were always calling us saying, what resources can we bring to the table? As you know, our state has been devastated. I've been in the Keys. If you go to the Keys, there were nine-foot storm surges, their homes just toppled. We don't want to lose a life.\nDown here in this part of the state we got a lot of flooding, a lot of wind, a lot of rain. We got flooding up in the northeast.\nWe're working hard to get our power back on. Our utilities have restored over 4 million homes already. We're down to about 25 percent of our homes, and every person in our state wants their power back. We all want our power back. But I want to thank them for what they're doing so far. We have high expectations. We want our power back as fast as possible.\nI want to thank the federal government for all of their support. If ports reopen, we get our fuel back in our state. We're short of fuel. We got lines in our gas stations. We still have lines at our gas stations.\nThe federal government has been a partner to help us make sure our ports get open so we get the fuel back into the state. We've done law enforcement escorts of our tanker trucks to get back to the gas stations and make sure we have fuel.\nSo everybody has worked hard. I want to thank our National Guard. We've called up over 8,000 National Guard members. We've got National Guard members from other states down here making sure that shelters were open, people were comfortable. We opened almost 600 shelters in record time, and it wouldn't have happened but for the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the National Guard, but also the National Guard from other states.\nSo we have a lot of work to do. We're not done today. We're going to work hard. I know the federal government will continue to be a partner, our locals will, our state will. We're going to make sure -- we're going to continue to be a strong, resilient state.\nBut as I said, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart, everybody's prayers to help us get through this. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: So we are now going to be making a tour of the areas. We're going to see some of the folks and make sure they're happy because we're trying to keep it as happy as we can under the circumstances. In many cases they lost their homes, and it's a tough situation. So we're going to go see a lot of the folks.\nAnd I will tell you again, I want to thank you. I want to thank the military. So thank everybody, and we'll see you later.\nMedia, we appreciate you being so understanding. It's been a very tough period of time even for you folks, and we really do appreciate your understanding. This has been a difficult situation.\nAs Rick knows, almost all of the roads are now open, and the ports are just about open. What we had to do to get some of those ports open, people wouldn't even believe that we did it so quickly. So we're very proud of the job that everybody around here has done.\nThank you all. Thank you very much. We'll see you later. Thank you.

And they're under construction, and then we'll make -- then we'll make a decision as to which one we want to use. We pretty much have a pretty good idea. But we are looking for extreme border security and surveillance, everything else.\nWe also have to get the wall. It doesn't have to be here, but they can't obstruct the wall -- whether it's in a budget or something else -- when we're ready --\nQ: Are you open to citizenship for DREAMers over time?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, we're not looking at citizenship. We're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here. We're working with everybody -- Republican. We're working with Democrat. I just spoke with Paul Ryan, he's onboard. Everybody is onboard. They want to do something. We're not talking about amnesty. We're talking about -- we're talking about taking care of people, people that were brought here, people that have done a good job and were not brought here of their own volition.\nBut very importantly, what we want -- we have to have a wall. If the wall is going to be obstructed when we need the funds -- at a little bit later date, we'll be determining how much we need -- then we're not doing any --\nQ: What do you say, Mr. President, to Steve King who says that your promises can't be believed? And what do you say to Senator Charles Grassley who said you undercut what he's doing in the Judiciary Committee by talking with Pelosi and Schumer last night about all this?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, what we're doing is we're doing it in conjunction with the Republicans. We have a very, very good relationship with a lot of people. A lot of people want this to happen. They expect it to happen, and we'll see if it happens.\nBut we'll only do it if we get extreme security, if we get not only surveillance, but everything that goes along with surveillance. And ultimately we have to have the wall. If we don't have the wall, we're doing nothing.\nQ: Why did the Democrats say there was a deal at dinner?\nTHE PRESIDENT: There was no deal and they didn't say they had a deal. In fact, they just put out a statement they didn't say that at all.\nQ: Mr. President, if Republicans aren't able to get something in six months, will you continue the DACA program on your own?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We'll talk about that. But I think a deal will be made before six months.\nQ: So no relief for DACA recipients unless you get the wall, is that what you're saying?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The wall -- at some point, they're going to have to -- they cannot obstruct the wall. The wall, to me, is vital. If I don't get the wall, then we will become the obstructionists.\nQ: What has to come first -- wall, agreement on the wall?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We have to have an understanding that whether it's in the budget or some other vehicle in a fairly short period of time, the wall will be funded. Otherwise, we're not doing anything.\nQ: On tax reform, Mr. President, can you clarify what you said yesterday when you said that the wealthiest Americans will stay the same, maybe pay a little more? Some people interpreted that to say that you may actually raise rates on them.\nTHE PRESIDENT: So the wealthy Americans are not my priority. My priority are people in the middle class, and that's where we're giving the big tax reduction to. It's about the middle class, and it's about jobs. And it's about bringing jobs back to the country, bringing back -- the companies back so that companies can get a reduction.\nRight now we're paying the highest tax rate in the world. We want to bring that to around 15 percent. That would make us competitive with China and other countries. So my priority is bringing companies back, bringing money back into the country. There's trillions of dollars outside of our country that we could bring back, but the taxes don't allow it to happen.\nQ: But would you possibly --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Just so you understand, my priority is jobs -- very simple, it's jobs and it's the middle class. Taking care of both.\nQ: Would you possibly raise rates on the wealthiest Americans?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't think we'll have to do that, but this is not to benefit the wealthy. This is to benefit the middle class and to benefit companies where they're going to be producing jobs. We want to produce jobs in this country. We want factories coming back, and they're already coming back. But we want factories coming back into our country.\nRight now they're leaving our country. They've started since I've been in, as you know -- you look at Michigan, you look at Ohio, you look at -- they're starting to come back. But to really bring them back, we have to reduce our tax rate. So we're trying to bring it down to around 15 percent.\nQ: But if you reduce -- it will bring taxes down on the wealthy.\nTHE PRESIDENT: What's going to happen is the individual rate coming down will be substantial for the middle class. We want to take care of the middle class. We want to take care of jobs. The way we're going to get jobs is to make our companies more competitive. And don't forget, a lot of these companies are public companies owned by the public, owned by pension funds, owned by vehicles such as that, so they'll get a big benefit.\nOur priority is jobs and the middle class. Okay, now let's go and see how we're doing because I think we're doing a good job in Florida.\nQ: Thank you, sir.", "timestamp": "2017-09-14", "title": "Remarks to the Press in Fort Myers, Florida"}

Established by visionary leaders, America's HBCUs have long played an integral role in our Nation's history, providing Black Americans opportunities to learn and achieve their dreams.\nMany HBCUs were founded under the cold shadow of segregation and racial prejudice. Before the Civil War, most institutions of higher learning denied admittance to minority students. HBCUs formed to overcome such discrimination and prove to the Nation that all students deserve a high-quality education, and that all Americans can rise to great heights if given the opportunity. For more than 150 years, HBCUs have produced some of our Nation's leaders in business, government, academia, and the military, and they have helped create a thriving and important Black middle class. Today, they continue to provide a rigorous education to students, who are often from low-income backgrounds, who seek to advance themselves and give back to their Nation. We can see the influences of HBCUs in every sector of our economy, from medicine and law, to sports and journalism.\nToday, more than 100 HBCUs are thriving in 19 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, enrolling more than 300,000 students. This year, Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week coincides with the 150th anniversary of nine HBCUs: Alabama State University, Barber-Scotia College, Fayetteville State University, Howard University, Johnson C. Smith University, Morehouse College, Morgan State University, St. Augustine's University, and Talladega College. It is a great honor for our Nation to join in celebrating the achievements of these nine institutions, as well as those of every HBCU across the country.\nInvesting in HBCUs strengthens America's future, and my Administration will help ensure that HBCUs continue to be self-sustainable and viable institutions of higher education for generations to come. This week, we will also host the Annual White House Historically Black College and Universities Summit to provide a forum for HBCU presidents, faculty members, students, government partners, and other stakeholders to address the priorities set forth in my Executive Order to Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, signed February 28, 2017. This annual summit also serves to honor HBCU All-Star Students, who are appointed for 1 year to serve as ambassadors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black College and Universities.\nNational Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week serves to remind us of the historic and ongoing struggle for equal access that led to the establishment of HBCUs in our Nation. We use this week to recognize the importance of HBCUs in educating the leaders of tomorrow, and reaffirm our commitment to providing every student with the opportunity to learn, grow, and find success no matter his or her background.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through September 23, 2017, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I call upon educators, public officials, professional organizations, corporations and all Americans to observe this week with the appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the countless contributions these institutions and their alumni have made to our country.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we recognize the men and women of our great Nation who work the land, often times at their own risk, to supply the United States and the world with essential products while creating jobs, supporting the economy, and protecting our environment and natural resources for future generations.\nFarmers, ranchers, foresters, and their families play critical roles in meeting our Nation's needs for food, fiber, forestry, fuel, and jobs. Each day, they perform a range of physically demanding and potentially dangerous tasks. These tasks often involve long hours and are performed in high-risk settings, whether working in confined storage buildings, operating heavy machinery, or handling hazardous chemicals, sometimes in harsh weather conditions.\nAccording to the Department of Labor, agriculture has the highest fatality rate of any industry sector in America, and reported 570 fatalities in 2015. These fatalities frequently result from transportation incidents and the dangers of working with heavy machinery. As the fortunate beneficiaries of these workers' long hours of physically demanding and dangerous labor, it is incumbent upon us all to be mindful of the hazards of this industry. To eliminate or minimize the risks, we must emphasize \"safety first\" and support comprehensive farm-safety education and training initiatives.\nAmerican farmers, ranchers, and foresters uphold values at the heart of the American character, and as such, it is our duty to protect and promote their safety and health. This week we pay tribute to those who earn their living from the land and honor their resolute work ethic, steadfast concern for others, and a strong sense of community.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through September 23, 2017, as National Farm Safety and Health Week.

Older than any other written constitution in use today, our Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances designed to preserve liberty, promote prosperity, and ensure the security of our beloved country. On this day and during this week, we recall the people and the principles that made our Nation great and commit ourselves to restoring that greatness.\nOur Constitution is founded on a fundamental trust in America's citizens. \"We the People,\" the Constitution proclaims, are the source of all governmental authority. We are, as President Lincoln declared in the war-torn fields of Gettysburg, a \"Government of the People, by the People, for the People.\" That is why we must be particularly mindful of a would-be ruling class that has lost sight of this foundational truth. In the drive for progressive reform, our Federal Government has grown beyond belief and has layered regulation on top of burdensome regulation. American citizens and businesses face an unrelenting onslaught of rules and regulations adopted by an army of regulators unaccountable to the citizens they seek to control.\nMy solemn promise as President is to return power to the American People -- to the workers and the warriors who made this Nation great and will make it great again. Restoring this founding principle of accountability requires us to once again respect the structural safeguards of our great Constitution. The Framers of our Constitution sought to preserve liberty by separating government power. In our constitutional system, the Congress is charged with authoring and amending the laws, in accordance with its beliefs about what will benefit our country. The President's duty is to execute those laws and protect the Nation, consistent with the Constitution. And the Judiciary's role is to faithfully apply the Constitution and the laws to resolve specific cases and controversies. Modern government, however, has rebelled against the constraints inherent in these defined roles, abandoning that original design in favor of a centralized system of out-of-control agencies that claim independence from elected leaders and demand deference from the courts.\nOn this day and during this week, I call on all citizens and all branches of government to reflect on the original meaning of our Constitution, and to recall the founding principles we too frequently forget: Our government exists to preserve freedom and to serve its citizens. We are accountable to the People. And the public deserves clear, intelligible laws that are enacted through an open, Constitutional process.\nAs the elected head of the Executive Branch, I call on Federal agencies to reduce the crushing burdens of the regulatory state and to restore fairness, transparency, and due process in all regulatory matters. We are here to enable the greatness of our Nation, not to restrain it. I call on the Congress to take up critical legislative measures, and to work together to set free the full potential of our People. I call on Federal judges to apply the law as it exists, not as they wish it to be -- to exercise, in the words of our Founders, \"neither force nor will, but merely judgment.\" And I call on all American citizens to pursue greatness in their lives through hard work and the insistence that their government exists only by the people, and for the people, of this great land.\nThe Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as \"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,\" and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as \"Constitution Week.\"\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2017, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17, 2017, through September 23, 2017, as Constitution Week. On this day and during this week, we celebrate the citizens and the Constitution that has made America the greatest Nation this world has ever known. In doing so, we recommit ourselves to the enduring principles of the Constitution and thereby \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\"\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

At the top I'd like to read a statement on the recent attacks in the UK and France:\nThe United States strongly condemns the cowardly terrorist attack in London today that targeted innocent civilians during their commute on the subway. We are grateful that no one was killed in this horrific incident. And our thoughts and prayers are with those injured, and we wish them a speedy and full recovery.\nWe are aware of the arrest that took place in Paris following the attack on a counterterrorism soldier, and we are thankful that the soldier was not seriously injured.\nWe are also aware of the attack in Burgundy, and our thoughts are with those wounded in that incident. France is our oldest and one of our closest allies, and we will certainly provide any support to their investigations that they request.\nLooking ahead to next week, the President and key members of his foreign policy team will be in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly.\nHere today are National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and United States Representative to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who will walk you through the meetings and other events of next week and then take some of your questions.\nAs always I'll be up afterwards to answer questions, unless of course you guys want to give me a free pass since it's Friday. (Laughter.)\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over. Thanks.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Good afternoon, everyone. I also want to begin by acknowledging the horrific attacks in Europe. The United States, of course, stands in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom and France. We will continue to work tirelessly with our partners to prevent attacks. And, of course, the United States remains committed to defeating terrorist organizations, as well as their evil ideology.\nThe President has been unambiguous here, energizing our defeat-ISIS campaign, and calling on Muslim-majority nations to combat extremism and to end financing of terrorist organizations. We will defend our people and our values against these cowardly attacks, and we will always stand with countries around the world to do the same.\nNow, I want to turn to President Trump's trip next week to attend the 72nd United Nations General Assembly. The President's consistent message across all of his engagements throughout the week will emphasize three goals common to all nations who will be gathered there: First, to promote peace. Second, to promote prosperity. And third, to uphold sovereignty and accountability.\nA peaceful world depends on the contributions of all nations. We must share responsibility for international security, while each country protects the security of its own people.\nProsperity is also a shared responsibility. The President looks forward to furthering economic cooperation, investment opportunities, and new business ties with other governments and businesses across the world. As always, this administration's ironclad commitment to free, fair, and reciprocal trade and access to markets will be the bedrock of our economic talks.\nSovereignty and accountability are the essential foundations of peace and prosperity. America respects the sovereignty of other countries, expects other nations to do the same, and urges all governments to be accountable to their citizens. That accountability is broken down in places such as Venezuela and Syria. And we also see, today, revisionist powers who are threatening the sovereignty in the greater Middle East, Eastern and Southern Europe, and in East Asia.\nNow, let me quickly run through the President's schedule. On Monday, the President will join senior U.N. leadership and the leaders of more than 120 other nations to discuss reforming the institution. The President will express support for Secretary General Guterres's reform efforts. The United Nations, of course, holds tremendous potential to realize its founding ideals, but only if it's run more efficiently and effectively.\nThat day, the President will also meet with the leaders of France and Israel, two of America's closest allies. While their conversations will be wide-ranging, we expect that Iran's destabilizing behavior, including its violation of the sovereignty of nations across the Middle East, to be a major focus.\nMonday evening, the President will host a working dinner with Latin American leaders. He's looking forward to discussing the crisis in Venezuela, as well as our increasingly strong economic ties, shared goals for elevating the prosperity of our peoples, and the extraordinary success of likeminded Latin American nations in recent decades.\nThe President's Tuesday morning speech to the General Assembly will emphasize the need for states to promote peace and prosperity, while upholding sovereignty and accountability as indispensable foundations of international order. He will urge all states to come together to address grave dangers that threaten us all. If nations meet these challenges, immense opportunity lies before us.\nLater that day, the President will have lunch with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, meet with this year's General Assembly President, Mr. Miroslav Laj?бk of Slovakia, and meet with the Emir of Qatar. In the evening, he will host a traditional diplomatic reception.\nOn Wednesday, the President will meet with the leaders of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, the United Kingdom, and Egypt. He will host a working luncheon with African leaders to discuss how the United States can help African nations develop their economies, address urgent challenges, and strengthen security relationships and economic relationships between our nations.\nFinally, on Thursday, the President will meet with the leaders of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. The latter two countries in particular have suffered direct and persistent attacks on their sovereignty in recent years.\nHe will also host a lunch with the leaders of South Korea and Japan. As Kim Jong-un's most recent missile launch demonstrates, North Korea remains one of the world's most urgent and dangerous security problems. It is vital that all nations work together to do our utmost to solve that problem.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ambassador Haley.\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Thank you very much. And I will tell you that next week is not going to be short on topics. I think, first of all, we can all say it is a new day at the U.N. The U.N. has shifted over the past several months. It's not just about talking, it's about action.\nThe members are starting to get used to act, whether it's Security Council resolutions, whether it's with U.N. reform, whether it's with peacekeeping. We're starting to see a lot of changes at the U.N. They are all anxious to see what the U.S. delegation looks like next week, and I think they will be heavily impressed with the fact that we have the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and many members of the National Security Council coming to really show the U.S. strength that we have in the world.\nAnd I think -- obviously this will be the first time that the President has addressed the General Assembly. They are all very anxious to hear what he has to say. And I think that he will make quite an impact in terms of all of the issues that we're dealing with.\nWe have three events that will be extremely important. First, the President will highlight the U.N. reform event. It is very, very important. We've got a massive reform package being led by the Secretary General that really streamlines not just the processes, but also the budget as it goes forward, and makes the U.N. much more effective. We basically have the President headlining a U.N. reform effort, which would really support the Secretary General. But the impressive part is, we asked other countries to sign on to their support of reform, and 120 countries have signed on and will be in attendance. That's a miraculous number.\nThe Vice President will be doing two very important briefings. He's going to do one on Human Rights Council. Now more than ever, human rights matters. We say all the time that if the government doesn't take care of its people, bad things will happen. And I think we're seeing that in multiple places, and that's all the reason why the Human Rights Council really needs to be effective. We have offered reform. I think the Vice President will go in and not only support the reform, but talk about why it's needed and the areas that are really needing to be addressed when it comes to human rights.\nThe second one he's going to do is on peacekeeping. And in the last several months, we have taken every peacekeeping mandate and changed it. Basically, we have saved half a billion dollars in peacekeeping. But before anyone thinks that's a travesty, basically the way they handled peacekeeping in the past was, if there was a challenged area they would throw more troops at it. But they didn't see if the troops were trained or give them the equipment to do their job. Now we're going towards the political solution, making sure the troops are trained and armed, making sure that we're more effective. So it's smarter and it cut half a billion, and in some cases we're having to increase, and in some cases we're having to decrease.\nSo having the Vice President talk about the importance of the peacekeeping being effective is going to be very important.\nAnd then, as I said, there are no shortage of issues, with North Korea being front and center. Iran will be an issue. Syria will certainly be talked about. Terrorism efforts and how we counter that is a huge topic on what we're dealing with. And obviously the humanitarian issues that we face around the world.\nSo, with that, I think the General Assembly is going to be quite active next week, and I think the U.S. is going to be very strong next week. And we look forward to a very good week.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Gentleman in the center.\nQ: Thank you, General. My question is about North Korea, which is perhaps the biggest foreign policy challenge for President Trump right now. About a month ago, the President issued a threat to North Korea; he warned of \"fire and fury.\" And as you know, Ambassador, at the U.N. Security Council you've imposed tougher sanctions on North Korea. Both of these efforts do not seem to be changing their behavior. Is it time for the U.S. to change its approach to North Korea? Is that something that you're contemplating? And, General, if you could weigh on this well. I appreciate it.\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: I think what was really important with North Korea was that we try and push through as many diplomatic options as we have. If you look at the resolutions that have passed in the last month, the two of them, they cut 30 percent of the oil. They banned all the laborers. They banned 90 percent of the exports. They banned joint ventures. We've basically taken and, in the words of North Korea, we have strangled their economic situation at this point. That's going to take a little bit of time, but it has already started to take effect.\nWhat we are seeing is they continue to be provocative, they continue to be reckless. And at that point, there's not a whole lot the Security Council is going to be able to do from here when you've cut 90 percent of the trade and 30 percent of the oil.\nSo, having said that, I have no problem kicking it to General Mattis, because I think he has plenty of options.\nQ: General, can you weigh on that too?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I'd just emphasize the point that Ambassador Haley made. These sanctions are just now taking effect. What's really important is rigorous enforcement of those sanctions so that we can really let the economic actions and diplomacy progress as best we can. But I think we ought to make clear what's different about this approach is, is that we're out of time, right? As Ambassador Haley said before, we've been kicking the can down the road, and we're out of road.\nAnd so for those who have said and have been commenting about the lack of a military option, there is a military option. Now, it's not what we would prefer to do, so what we have to do is call on all nations, call on everyone to do everything we can to address this global problem short of war.\nSo that is implementing now these significant sanctions that have just now gone into place, and it is convincing everyone to do everything that they can and that it's in their interest to do it.\nWhat's different, I think, about this approach to North Korea is worth noting. First of all, there is consensus among all key nations that denuclearization of the Peninsula is the only acceptable objective.\nThe second thing is, this is not an issue between the United States and North Korea. This is an issue between the world and North Korea.\nAnd the third recognition is, there is a lot that we can about it together. And so we need time, obviously, for any strategy to work. It is a sound approach to a very difficult problem, and we'll see if it succeeds.\nQ: Ambassador Haley, a conference call preceded your briefing here. Jonathan Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that next week's UNGA will be as much the world taking measure of the United States as it is the U.S. speaking to the world. He went on to say that the UNGA, because of its very quick meetings, is sort of like speed dating from hell, and that it's a very sophisticated dance that neither Secretary of State Tillerson or the President have a particularly strong point on. What would you say to people who are wondering how the U.S. will do at next week's UNGA?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: I think there's a lot of interest in how the U.S. is going to do, and they're going to find out we are going to be solid, we're going to be strong.\nIf you look at all of the meetings that the national security team has, these are important meetings. These aren't just wasting time. This is going to talk about terrorism; this is going to talk about the issues in North Korea; this is going to talk about the issue in Burma and what we're dealing with there; Venezuela -- all of these issues. No one is going to grip and grin. The United States is going to work.\nAnd I think with all of the challenges around the world, I think the international community is going to see that. This is a time to be serious, and it's a time for us to talk out these challenges and make sure there's action that follows it.\nQ: One of the big questions from some of the people outside of this room and other countries is, in addition to what we do militarily is the humanitarian effort. And we've been criticized for not being involved in the humanitarian effort too much, especially by the third world. So when you go to New York, in addition to addressing the security measures, how are you going to address the criticism about the U.S. not leading humanitarian efforts?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: We actually have led humanitarian efforts and continue to. Human rights, in general, is very important. That's something we've been loud on, which is the fact that you have to protect human rights.\nBut the humanitarian side of what we're seeing in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo; what we're seeing with the Syrian refugees that are in Turkey and Jordan; the fact that we are trying to deal with Burma and find out ways that we can get humanitarian access in there. Yemen is something that the United States has been working very closely with the Saudis on and the U.N. to try and make sure we get humanitarian access.\nSo we have been as active and vocal and leading the charge on humanitarian access in all of these areas, and we are making a difference. I think just in Syria, we've had over $3 billion that we've given, in terms of helping that situation. Venezuela, you saw what we did with the sanctions, but we're making sure they get that. Right now in Burma, we are taking that very seriously, and that's of utmost importance that we get front and center on that one.\nQ: I have a question first to General McMaster before I get to one on North Korea for you. General, you mentioned the, obviously, terror incident overseas in London. The President tweeted this morning that it was \"sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.\" You may have seen Prime Minister may say it was \"not helpful for people to speculate.\" Did the President share information that he wasn't supposed to? And if not, why was he speculating?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I think what the President was communicating is that, obviously, all of our law enforcement efforts are focused on this terrorist threat for years. Scotland Yard has been a leader, as our FBI has been a leader.\nSo I think if there was a terrorist attack here, God forbid, that we would say that they were in the sights of the FBI. So I think he didn't mean anything beyond that.\nQ: I'm sorry, I'm not clear. Meaning he was saying generally terrorists are a focus for Scotland Yard, or was he saying in this specific incident, Scotland Yard knew potentially this was coming?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I think he means generally that this kind of activity is what we're trying to prevent. And so these organizations that are responsible for it, whatever comes out of this investigation, that remains to be seen. It is likely that law enforcement had been working on that problem set.\nQ: And did that come up in the call with Prime Minister May?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I was not on that call this morning.\nQ: Ambassador, to you, on North Korea. Obviously there's more U.N. Security Council action that could be taken. Are you at all hopeful that there is any chance for a full oil embargo as this administration had wanted? Or at what point -- President Trump himself said this was a small step, the last U.N. Security Council vote. I think disagreeing with you, but Secretary Tillerson agreed with him that it seemed to have been a small step. So at what point does this administration take a bigger step and, for example, put tougher sanctions on China in order to put pressure on North Korea?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Well I think, first of all, let's talk about what a big sanctions resolution this was. The first one was a billion dollars. The second one was $1.3 billion, not counting the 30 percent decrease in oil. We did a 55 -- and just imagine if this happened to the United States -- a 55 percent reduction in diesel and oil. Overall ban of natural gas, overall ban of any substitutes; overall ban of textiles; stopping the labor program, which we call as modern-day slavery; stopping all joint ventures so foreign investment goes in there.\nWe have cut off now 90 percent of trade going into North Korea, and they are saying that this was strangling. So whether some believe it's big or small, I think what the President is saying is this is just the beginning of what we can do.\nSo it's going to be -- by the time we get going on this, if we have to go further, this is going to look small compared to what we do.\nBut no, it was a massive sanctions bill, and I think the fact that we had a 15-0 record and you have China onboard and Russia onboard, I think that's very important. We've cut 30 percent of the oil. Is there more you can do? There's always more you can do, but then you get into the humanitarian aspect of it, which is at what point are you going and actually hurting down to the people of North Korea. But we will always explore all options that we have.\nYes, in the red.\nQ: Thank you, Ambassador. You said that Syria is going to be on the agenda. As you know, today Turkey, Russia, and Iran agreed to deploy 1,500 monitors in the Idlib province. Does that leave the U.S. behind? And what exactly the focus will be when you talk about Syria at the U.N. next week?\nAnd, General, if I can, you said that the meeting between the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu will talk about Iran. How much of the peace process with the Palestinians will take place in that meeting? Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: I think the efforts in Syria have been remarkable -- both Syria and Iraq. To see how we have really bulldozed through ISIS in the way that we have shows how strong the U.S. had been in partnership with them, but I think we're also looking at post-ISIS -- what does that look like? And I can tell you, Iran is not going to be in charge, and Iran is not going to have any sort of leadership in that situation to where they could do more harm.\nBut Syria is always going to be a topic. I think we continue to be strong in making sure there's no chemical weapons and making sure that we're looking at the humanitarian situation. But the U.S. is a very strong partner in the resolution for Syria and will continue to be until we know that everything is stable.\nQ: (Inaudible) that does not include the U.S.?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Well, I think we're not going to be satisfied until we see a solid and stable Syria, and that is not with Assad in place. But what we are going to do is continue to be very effective and be a part of that process so that we get to a resolution.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Yeah, I'll just say that, of course the President will talk about the prospects for lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, among a broad range of regional issues, with really all of the leaders he's meeting during the week.\nQ: Ambassador, two quick questions. The first one is, the fact that president Putin and President Xi Jinping won't be there, will it have an impact on the what the outcome of whatever you'll discuss on Syria and North Korea?\nAnd, General, you've been insisting a lot on the respect of sovereignty. Wouldn't an investment in a peacekeeping mission be part of getting involved and having a stronger impact on this?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: I do think that it's still going to be strong and have an impact because you've got two very strong foreign ministers from Russia and China that are going to be there. And the idea that we're going to be talking about Syria and North Korea, and Iran, and all of those other things, I think it will be serious discussions.\nAnd I think the fact that President Xi and President Putin couldn't be there is not going to change the effect of the talks that we have next week.\nQ: Are you disappointed that they're not going to show up?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: That's their choice to not show up.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I would just add on to say the U.N. General Assembly is not a substitute for bilateral relationships with any nations. And as you know, the President has been working very closely, especially with President Xi, on this common problem and this world problem of North Korea.\nSo those discussions will continue, and it will continue in the context of multilateral engagements but also in context of our bilateral relationship with China.\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Back in the back.\nQ: Thank you, Madam Ambassador, General. A question regarding etiquette. In the past, Presidents have copiously avoided certain world leaders. A decade ago, President Bush avoiding President Ahmadinejad when he was at the opening of the U.N. Will the President speak to President Maduro at all when he is there?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Yeah, I think it's unlikely that he'll speak with President Maduro. As you know, the United States designated President Maduro after he victimized his own people, denied them their rights under his own constitution. And I think as the President has made clear, he's willing to talk at some point in the future, but it would have to be after rights are restored to the Venezuelan people.\nQ: Thank you, Madam Ambassador. Two questions. One, what is the future of India and the United Nations membership and Security Council? Because when Prime Minister Modi visited the White House he brought up this issue with President Trump.\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Well, I think that Security Council reform is still being talked about, and I know that it's something that India wants. Many other countries want it as well. So we'll have to wait and see.\nQ: Do you have any indications right now that sanctions will work towards North Korea?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: You have to look at how much has been cut off. They've already started to feel it, but they're getting ready to feel 90 percent of their exports going away; 30 percent of their oil. Imagine what that would do to the United States if it was there.\nAnd if you look at what -- I was looking at what North Korea was saying. They said it was a full-scale economic blockade, suffocating its state and its people. This is dramatic. This is something -- and not only is it dramatic, but you're looking at -- Peru has dropped ties. Thailand has dropped ties. We're seeing so many just kind of get rid of either the ambassadors or the trade that they're doing. There is no way that North Korea doesn't feel this.\nNow, how they choose to respond, this is totally in their hands on how they respond.\nOne more question. I'll let you pick who gets the last question.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Appreciate it. So I was wondering -- we talked a little bit about the President, the speech that he'll deliver on Tuesday. But I'm wondering if you could talk in any more detail now -- and I'm sure we'll get more detail later -- will he be sending direct messages about Iran and North Korea in that speech? Are there any more specific themes?\nAnd also, Ambassador Haley, I wanted to ask you: On the question of U.N. funding, I know reform is probably an important part of this question, but as a candidate, President Trump was -- then-candidate Trump was somewhat skeptical about the reach and the import of the U.N., the point of it long term. As President I'm sure he's learned more. Is the U.S. committed both to fulfilling its financial obligations? And where does it stand on terms of its voluntary funding for the U.N. going forward? Would you talk a little bit about that?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Right. To start off with the speech that the President gives, I think you can see it for yourself. I personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with the U.S. being very strong in the end.\nQ: So it's written, and you've seen it?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: I have seen it, yes. And then the second part of it is, the U.N. -- when I originally spoke with the President, what I said is, we'll see what we can make of it. And that's the thing is, we're creating an opportunity. We're making the most of it. We're moving foreign policy. We're changing the way peacekeeping is done. We're really bringing up human rights. And more importantly, what I appreciate is they stopped focusing on the commas and the periods, and we're actually acting. We're actually seeing strong things happens.\nAnd so I think the President has always believed there's great potential in the United Nations, but I think now the world is seeing it -- that it is actually changing, and it's actually becoming more effective.\nQ: Will he firmly articulate his intention to continue traditional U.S. funding at full levels?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: I think you'll have to wait and see. Thank you very much.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, General McMaster. Thank you, Ambassador Haley, General McMaster.\nI figured you guys would rather take questions from them since you've seen me every day, so I tried to let that go on for a little bit longer.\nWe're going to be pretty tight on time, so I'm going to try to get through things pretty quickly. Before I take your questions, I wanted to make one quick comment about our new friend, Frank, that many of you got to see here today. We welcomed Frank to the White House this morning. Frank is an inspiring 11-year-old young man from Virginia who started his lawn-mowing business.\nHe wrote the President a letter earlier this year that I read from the podium about his admiration for the President's business background and offered to cut the grass at the White House. He got to do that this morning.\nThe President has always loved go-getters like Frank and invited him to come spend the morning with our world-class grounds crew.\nFrank did a great job cutting the grass in the Rose Garden and later spent some time in the Oval Office with the President.\nThe President believes it's our duty to keep the American\nDream alive for kids like Frank, and it was an honor for all of us to host him here at the White House. So thank you, Frank, for coming.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions, and we'll try to get through as many as we can.\nJeff.\nQ: Sarah, a follow-up on something that Ambassador Haley said. She mentioned that she would feel comfortable kicking this issue to Secretary Mattis. Should Americans be concerned about the possibility of war? And how much time are you willing to give China to implement the resolutions in the U.N. Security Council agreement?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, we're not going to broadcast, and I'm not going to lay out a timetable on what that would look like. We're continuing to keep all options on the table. We're going to push forward with a plan right now.\nAnd again, as both General McMaster and Ambassador Haley stated, we are working on putting that pressure on North Korea to reach that ultimate goal of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. That's what we're focused on. We're going to go keep pushing forward on that front. But at the same time, we're going to keep all our options on the table as we do that.\nQ: What will the President say to the leaders that he meets next week who are eager for talks with North Korea? I know that the President has opposed that. How will he address that with the Europeans and others who are in favor of it?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm certainly not going to get ahead of any conversations that the President is going to have. As always, we'll provide readouts and background of those conversations. But I think the President will be very clear that putting extreme pressure on North Korea is very important.\nQ: Thank you. The President today tweeted out that he wants to see ESPN apologize for what he called \"untruths.\" By him saying that, though, does that mean that he's willing to apologize for birtherism claims that he had -- that he called on for years?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has made plenty of comments on that front. I think the point is that ESPN has been hypocritical. They should hold anchors to a fair and consistent standard. ESPN suspended a long-time anchor, Linda Cohn, not too long ago for expressing a political viewpoint. The network's public editor has said that there is a perception that ESPN has become political and that has harmed the network. This is clearly a political statement. They should be consistent in whatever guidelines that they have set themselves in that front.\nJohn.\nQ: But couldn't you say the same thing about him not apologizing for birtherism --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry I'm going to try to keep moving so I can cover as much ground as possible.\nQ: -- which is not true?\nMS. SANDERS: John, go ahead.\nQ: Do you still stand by your statement of the other day when you said that what Jemele Hill did was a fireable offense?\nMS. SANDERS: I do. And again, I think that they laid that out themselves by suspending one of their own anchors for political comments.\nGo ahead.\nQ: Back on the President's response to the London attack, is the President aware that the British Prime Minister said that his speculation was not helpful? What was his reaction?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that the President and the Prime Minister spoke, and we'll offer a readout on that call later today.\nQ: Did this come up in that conversation?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe it did. I understand it may have come up.\nQ: Sarah, the President this morning tweeted that chain migration could not be a part of any immigration bill. What did he mean by that?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is focused on making sure that in the efforts of these ongoing conversations between both Democrats and Republicans, that we deliver on responsible immigration reform. He wants to help American workers and families. No deal has been final -- reached on this process. He supports making an agreement on DACA, but that would have to include massive border security and interior enforcements. The President continues to push for those things. He's still 100 percent committed to the wall. And we're going to be laying out what our specific priorities and principles are in that front over the next seven to ten days, and we'll make sure that you guys are all part of that.\nQ: This was a priority that he laid out, chain migration. This is referring to the idea that people given status in a bill could not then sponsor relatives later for immigration status. Has he drawn a red line on that?\nMS. SANDERS: As you know, this President doesn't use the term \"red line.\" But again, we're going to lay out specific priorities, what that looks like over the next seven to ten days, and I'd imagine you'll get more details on that front.\nDavid.\nQ: Let me just clarify something. It was said several times yesterday, by the President on Air Force One and by one of your deputies, that he White House did not support an immigration bill that deals with amnesty -- amnesty. How would you define amnesty? And does a path to citizenship for DREAMers or other undocumented people fall into that category?\nMS. SANDERS: The President supports the DACA program and supporting making a deal on that. But again, that has to include that massive border security.\nQ: That could include a path to citizenship. The DACA is deferred deportation, as you know -- the law means you can still be --\nMS. SANDERS: The whole definition says \"deferred,\" so I think that takes away the idea of the permanent piece. The idea of DACA, literally the definition of it, is \"deferred action,\" meaning it's not a permanent process.\nQ: So you do support -- so you don't support the path to citizenship, is that what you're saying?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we want to have conversations, and we're going to lay out exactly what those principles look like over the next seven to ten days. Right now our goal, our focus is making sure that that program gets taken care of with -- also coupling that with massive border security, interior enforcement. Some of the specific things that we'd probably like to see: end to sanctuary cities, expedited removal, more immigration judges, supporting things like the RAISE Act. Those are things that you'll see us focus on and talk more about in the coming days.\nHallie.\nQ: Sarah, two very quick ones, because I know you're tied on time. Number one, the President said today he wanted the travel ban to be \"larger, tougher, and more specific.\" As you know, arguments are set to start next month on the travel ban currently in place. Why is he fighting for it if it's, in fact, too small, not tough enough, and too broad?\nMS. SANDERS: It's a step in the right direction. The President's travel executive order is motivated by national security, and every step we can take to protecting people in this country, that's a step we're going to take. And we're going to continue to push forward.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Can I quickly follow on the second part, Sarah, on your comments on ESPN? Did it give you any pause to make those comments about a private company from the podium here at the White House?\nMS. SANDERS: I wasn't being talked about a private company, but an individual.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. When a deal is ultimately reached, if there is one reached, on the issue of DACA, will it be a deal that's reached between the President, as the top Republican; the President, along with Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader in the Senate and Democrats; or will it be just the President alone?\nMS. SANDERS: We'd certainly hope that it's a bipartisan bill that has both Republicans and Democrats coming together to really focus on responsible immigration reform. I think there are a lot of people on both sides that want to see this happen. We've had a lot of conversations with both Republicans and Democrats over the past week, and we're going to continue to do that and push forward.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. A quick -- a question, but a quick clarification on the ESPN matter. You had said it was a fireable offense. That's being interpreted as saying that she should be fired. Are you or the President saying that she should be fired?\nMS. SANDERS: That's not a decision that I'm going to make. That's something for ESPN to decide. Again, I was asked about that. I think it is a fireable offense based on the standard that ESPN has set themselves by saying that people that go too far and make political comments have been suspended from their own network. I think that that is a consistency that they should probably focus on.\nMargaret.\nQ: But how is that not advice to private company?\nMS. SANDERS: Margaret. Hallie, I've already taken a question from you.\nQ: I guess I'm just trying to clarify that. And I know you have and I appreciate that, but you said it was an individual not a private company.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm just asking you to be respectful to your colleagues so that I can get around the room. I've got about two minutes left.\nQ: But we'd like an answer to that.\nMS. SANDERS: Go ahead, Margaret.\nQ: You haven't answered it. Could you?\nQ: All the other people want an answer.\nMS. SANDERS: Go ahead.\nQ: Thank you.\nMS. SANDERS: And this will be the last question since we're tight on time.\nQ: Can we do a schedule before the end? That's all I wanted to ask.\nQ: I don't want to take Margaret's question away. I'll call on that clarification, Sarah, because you said you don't have advice for a private company, yet you're giving advice to ESPN.\nMS. SANDERS: I said it's not my decision to make for a private company. I was asked specific about that individual. I made a comment. I stand by it. I think ESPN needs to stand by the standard that they have set in their own actions that they've taken about previous employees. I really don't have much else to add on that front.\nMargaret.\nQ: For scheduling purposes, the U.N. stuff starts Monday, and that briefing is over, but can you walk us through the President's schedule? Is there anything we should listen for in the speech this afternoon? Can you talk about whether he's doing anything kind of policy-related or meeting with anyone interesting in Bedminster over the weekend? Is there anything else that they didn't go over on the schedule for next week about UNGA involving the First Lady or anyone else in the administration? Just get our heads around the next week.\nMS. SANDERS: The First Lady does have a couple of events. We'll be sure to get the details of those out for next week. She will be participating in the activities and some of the meetings at the United Nations General Assembly next week. The President will be spending most of his weekend preparing for the meetings and the speech that will be taking place next week.\nAs you can hear, the President is getting ready to depart. And with that, we'll end. Hope you guys have a good weekend. We'll see you on Monday.\nEND 1:56 P.M.

From Texas to Louisiana to Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, we are coordinating closely with local authorities to help everyone impacted by these catastrophic storms. When Americans are in need, America pulls together. And we will not rest until everyone is safe, sound, and secure. We will be there tomorrow and the day after, as we work to respond, recover, and rebuild.\nWhen Americans are united, no force on earth can break us apart.\nThis week, the United States celebrates the 230th Anniversary of the signing of our remarkable Constitution.\nThe fifty-five Delegates to the Grand Convention in Philadelphia met from May to September of 1787. They gave us an incredible gift: a vision of the sovereign and self-governing people to control their own affairs. And they gave us a Constitutional system that protected our liberties by enshrining the Rule of Law.\nPatriots like Washington, Madison, Hamilton, Franklin, and so many others had already achieved immortality through their victory in the Revolution. But soon after, these extraordinary leaders faced another task unlike any other—the task of building a brand new nation. So they designed a system of government, rooted in common laws, history, and traditions that would secure the liberty, equality, and rights they had fought for and fought to defend in the American Revolution.\nThe Framers of our Constitution triumphantly declared to whom the government of the United States belonged: it was \"WE THE PEOPLE.\" These three beautiful words are among the most important ideas in our nation's history: the idea that government's power is vested in the nation's citizens – the people to whom we owe our ultimate and sacred allegiance. Our soldiers fight and die to protect our citizens, and our government is forever duty bound to safeguard their sovereignty and their freedom.\nFor 230 years, we have governed ourselves and planned our own destiny, guarded all the way by the Constitution of the United States.\nOn this Sunday, Constitution Day, let us recommit ourselves to our Founding Principles, and rededicate ourselves to our glorious heritage. We have inherited a birthright of freedom – we must defend it dearly, protect it jealously, and promote it proudly, as one nation under God. We must rise to the task of self-governance, prove worthy of the sacrifices made to carve out this magnificent nation, and we must give our loyalty to our Republic and its citizens in all that we do.\nSo let us pledge allegiance to our flag, devote our hearts to our country, and demonstrate our love for one another—as Americans, as Patriots, and as the children of God.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-09-15", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Preliminary data indicates that approximately 64,000 Americans died last year of drug overdoses in the United States, the majority of them from opioids. The number of infants born with opioid dependence has more than quadrupled in the past decade. Nearly 100 Americans, on average, die each day from opioid overdoses, and overdose rates are highest among people between 25 to 54 years old, robbing so many of our young people of their potential. This is a genuine crisis that my Administration is working tirelessly to address.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is leading an interagency effort to maximize the effect of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) programs. In March, I issued an Executive Order establishing the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis (Commission) to study how the Federal Government can most effectively address the epidemic. The Commission will release its final recommendations this fall, and my Administration will rely on its findings to inform a whole-of-government emergency response plan. In addition, my FY 2018 Budget commits significant resources to fighting this epidemic, including $1.3 billion in investments for CARA and Cures Act programs, 21st Century Cures Act programs, and other opioid-related initiatives that seek to prevent opioid abuse, improve access to treatment and recovery support services, and enhance overdose prevention programs.\nThis week, we reaffirm our commitment to fighting the opioid and heroin epidemic. Too many families know the enduring personal, emotional, and financial harm caused by prescription opioid and heroin addiction. To the men and women who are currently seeking or receiving treatment and to those who are in recovery: We stand with you, we pray for you, and we are working every single day to help you. As a Nation, we will come together to save lives and end this crisis.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through September 23, 2017, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week. I call upon my fellow Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, religious services, and other activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128271", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nEvery day, innocent Americans are the victims of terrible crimes perpetrated by violent gangs and criminal cartels. During National Gang Violence Prevention Week, my Administration pledges to restore justice to American communities and keep evil off our streets by eradicating the gangs that commit these despicable acts.\nDuring the previous Administration, the number of gangs and gang members reached an alarming 20-year high. In 2015 alone, homicides spiked by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities -- the largest increase in 25 years. Gangs continue to evolve and adapt. Today they have expanded to almost 1.5 million members nationwide who perpetrate an average of 48 percent of violent crimes in most jurisdictions and up to 90 percent in others. My Administration will not stand by idly as these menacing gangs threaten the safety and security of our communities.\nParticularly, we must address the rise of violent transnational criminal gangs, such as MS-13, that have infiltrated our neighborhoods and recruited our vulnerable young people. Weak border security, failure to enforce immigration laws already on the books, and sanctuary cities have emboldened criminals to enter the United States illegally and enabled gang and transnational cartel members to engage with impunity in illegal human and drug trafficking, corruption and fraud, and barbaric acts including violence, sexual assaults, and murder.\nMy Administration has pledged to identify and eradicate transnational organized crime, gangs, and gang violence. During my first 100 days as President, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency led a coordinated effort to capture more than 30,000 convicted criminal aliens, including more than 1,000 gang members and affiliates. Many of these arrests were of immigration fugitives who had committed heinous acts of gang violence: smuggling, sex crimes, arson, extortion, or cruelty to innocent children. By Executive Order, I also created the Council on Transnational Organized Crime, which has been hard at work coordinating Federal resources to better identify, prosecute, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations. As a result of these steps and the new partnerships we have formed at all levels of government, illegal border crossings have declined drastically since I took office.\nThe Congress has also indicated a willingness to address this pressing issue. Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. My Administration strongly supports this legislation. Once enacted, it will protect law-abiding Americans by denying criminal alien gang members admission into the United States and by giving law enforcement more effective tools to remove them. I encourage the Senate to act quickly to enact this bill into law and help protect the safety of Americans.\nThis week, let us rededicate ourselves to destroying the criminal gangs that have plagued American neighborhoods and communities for far too long. We owe this to all those affected by gang violence and to all who seek a brighter future.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of September 17 through September 23, 2017, as \"National Gang Violence Prevention Week.\" I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128282", "text": "MRS. TRUMP: Good afternoon. I want to thank the brave men and women who wear the noble uniform of the U.S. Air Force for having us here today.\nI had the privilege to visit with some of your wonderful children at the youth center here on base. I enjoy our time together, getting to know them, and want to thank everyone who helped make this visit possible.\nEvery child whose parent serves in our great military should be enormously proud because your mom or dad is a true American hero. In the wake of two devastating hurricanes, the world has witnessed your courage and compassion, and you have made every American proud.\nAmericans have trust in the United States Air Force because we know you will never quit, you will never yield, and you will never fail. We know that we are free because you are brave.\nI know I speak on behalf of myself and my husband when I tell you we are grateful for your service. I also want to take a moment to recognize the families of those who serve. You endure the time apart, are expected to move when new orders come in, and face the uncertainty that came in the times of need. This kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of courage, and your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated. Thank you.\nPlease know that our gratitude is boundless and goes out to each and every one of you with unconditional appreciation. This administration will always stand with the men and women of the United States Air Force. And know now it's my great pleasure to introduce my husband, the President of the United States, Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. At ease, at ease. Please sit down.\nThank you, Melania, for that wonderful introduction and for being such an incredible emissary for the American people. She's become very, very popular -- tell you that. Very proud of her. Thank you.\nSecretary Wilson, General Goldfein, Chief Wright, General Jacobson, Colonel Teichert, I'm honored to join you on this really, really historic occasion, the 70th Anniversary of the United States Air Force, the greatest air force on the face of this Earth -- by far. (Applause.)\nBefore we begin, I want to say that our hearts and prayers go out the people of London who suffered a vicious terrorist attack today. I spoke with a wonderful woman, British Prime Minister Theresa May, this morning and relayed America's deepest sympathy, as well as our absolute commitment to eradicating the terrorists from our planet. Radical Islamic terrorism -- it will be eradicated. Believe me. (Applause.)\nAmerica and our allies will never be intimidated. We will defend our people, our nations, and our civilization from all who dare to threaten our way of life. This includes the regime of North Korea, which has once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbors and for the entire world community.\nAfter seeing your capabilities and commitment here today, I am more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming.\nOur thoughts also remain with those recovering in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. I visited Florida yesterday, where the American people have once again shown the world how resilient, strong, and truly united we are. We're going to help our fellow Americans put their lives, their homes, and their communities back together because when Americans are in need, Americans pull together.\nAnd we know we can always count on the courageous members of our nation's military to be there every step of the way, just like more than 400 Air Force medical personnel who have deployed to Florida to help care for the sick and the injured. To the men and women who proudly wear the Air Force uniform, who keep our country safe, and who fill our hearts with pride, thank you for your service and devotion to America. Thank you. (Applause.)\nI am truly thrilled to join you today at this really incredible milestone -- 70 years since the founding of the United States Air Force. Congratulations. (Applause.)\nWe're celebrating 70 years of history, 70 years of heroes, and 70 years of victory. I also want to thank all of the amazing family members and loved ones whose sacrifices make your service possible. We love you, we appreciate you and everything you do. Thank you. (Applause.)\nFor seven decades the United States Air Force has pushed the boundaries of science and technology, helped restore peace and stability to troubled lands, and kept Americans safe from those who threaten our very way of life.\nNothing inspires more confidence in our friends or strikes more fear in the hearts of our enemies than the sight of American warplanes on the horizon. You patrol the sky, protect the homeland, and deliver American justice to anyone who dares to threaten our people.\nFrom the earliest wooden biplanes, to the high-tech UAVs, to the awesome power and stunning beauty of the F-35, B-2, F-22, -- and I saw a lot of them today -- the F-15, the F-16, the F-18, I don't know which one I liked the most.\nBut our aviators have given America total dominance of the air and space, no matter where we fly. Now when our enemies hear the F-35 engines, when they're roaring overhead, their souls will tremble and they will know the day of reckoning has arrived.\nThat is the way it's been since 1947, when the Air Force was born during a time of monumental change and uncertainty in the world. Unconditional victory in World War II had come at a terrible price. Millions of lives had been lost, empires had collapsed, and much of Europe laid in ruin.\nThe threat of global communism emerged from the void left by defeated foes. And the free nations of the world, once again, looked to the United States to secure the peace. It was at this crucial moment that America established the Air Force as a separate military service and a truly great military service.\nAnd from that moment, America has dominated both air and space like no other nation in history. Our air superiority is unquestioned -- not merely because we have the best equipment, but because we have the best people by far. (Applause.)\nFrom the Berlin Airlift, through the gantlet of MiG Ally, to the skies of above the jungles of Southeast Asia, and the deserts of the Middle East, American airmen have proven that they have no equal in courage, capability, or commitment.\nYou are the ones who own the sky. You are our greatest weapon of all. In the last 64 years, American ground forces have not lost a single life to an enemy air strike -- pretty amazing -- and that is truly a testament to the strategy and skill of American airmen and the essential role you play in our national defense.\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I am committed to keeping the United States military the best trained, best equipped, and most technologically advanced fighting force on the planet.\nOne of my first acts as President was to direct the rebuilding of our armed forces and rebuilding we are. (Applause.)\nCongress took an important step this year by heeding my call for a $20 billion increase in defense spending, and we're going to be doing even much more than that. But the servicemen and women who defend our nation with their lives deserve the predictable and consistent funding that will help them win quickly and win decisively. (Applause.)\nAnd I will tell you that the new equipment that we're ordering by the billions -- by the absolute billions and billions -- it's equipment like you've never even thought of before. There is nobody in the world that will have anything even close to us and what we're doing, and that's my great honor. Believe me. I said it early on and I say it again, there is nobody even close. (Applause.)\nOur armed forces have endured continuous combat for the past 26 years, yet despite this, the number of airmen on active duty has dropped by one-third since the 1990s, and we've cut more than half of our fighter squadrons. Terrible. That is why I'm calling on Congress to end the defense sequester once and for all and to give our military the tools, training, equipment and resources that our brave men and women in uniform so richly deserve. And that is happening. (Applause.)\nEach of you is fulfilling your duty to America, and now government must fulfill its duty to you. And to you, right? To you, right? (Laughter and applause.)\nWe will stop delaying needed investments in our readiness, and we will renew our commitment to the patriots who keep America safe.\nIn so doing, we will continue the proud legacy of service that each of you has inherited, a legacy built over the generations by legends like Yeager, Wagner, Rickenbacker, Boyd, Grissom, and Schriever -- the heroes who broke barrier after barrier to push America farther. And they really did. They broke so many different barriers -- they went farther, faster, and they always went on to victory.\nLike them, each of you is a living, breathing symbol of our great country, the United States of America. The characteristics that define the Air Force aviator -- boldness and bravery, action and instinct, power and grace -- are woven deep into the American spirit and have defined our people since our nation was founded.\nThe legendary Air Force General Robin Olds immortalized those attributes when he said: \"Fighter pilot is an attitude. It's cockiness. It's aggressiveness.\" It's self-cockiness, and you know that. \"It is confidence. It is a streak of rebelliousness.\" Is that true? I don't know. (Laughter and applause.)\nAnd I just met a lot of these folks. They're better looking than Tom Cruise, and we know they can fight better, and we know they can fly better. They better be able to. (Applause.)\nGreat people. They're truly, truly competitive. But there's something else -- there's a spark. There's a desire to be good, to do well in the eyes of their peers.\nThat desire to do good, to soar past every challenger, to overcome every obstacle, and to win for your fellow citizens and the land that we love is the same desire that beats in the heart of every red-blooded American patriot.\nWe are, and forever will be, a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and renegades, aviators and astronauts. We crave adventure and achievement, exploration and enlightenment. We carved out a home in the New World, gave birth to the modern world, and we will shape tomorrow's world with the strength and skill of American hands. Because for America, the sky is never the limit. (Applause.)\nThat is why the United States Air Force will remain the most awe-inspiring flying force ever known to man. Like every part of our military, the Air Force is born from the will of our people -- to search, to explore, to reach new heights. It is the people's will that you reflect and their power that you project to every single corner of the globe.\nEarlier this year I had the honor of speaking with a great Army Air Corps and Air Force legend, Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole, the last surviving Doolittle Raider, and a true American hero.\nLike those who serve today, Dick Cole was a common American who answered to the call of duty with uncommon devotion. His place in the pages of history might have seemed unlikely prior to that fateful mission. He had never seen the ocean before boarding a ship that would take him halfway around the world. Neither he, nor anyone else, had ever flown a B-2 [B-25] into combat from the deck of an aircraft carrier. Nor had we ever seen anybody to use a parachute before bailing out thousands of feet above the Chinese mainland.\nBut he knew what his country needed, and what his duty required. And there was no barrier that could stop Colonel Cole and his fellow Raiders from accomplishing their mission.\nIt is that spirit of daring, devotion, and duty, and love of our country that has defined the Air Force for the past 70 years and will lift each of you to new heights every day from this day forward.\nThere is no distance too far, no speed too fast, no challenge too great, and no height too high that will keep the United States Air Force -- or the American people -- from total victory.\nThe American people are eternally grateful. We will stand with you always. And never forget: I am always on your wing.\nHappy 70th birthday to the United States Air Force. Happy birthday to everybody. We are so proud of you. Congratulations to each and every one of you. And thank you for keeping America proud, strong, safe, and free.\nThank you. May God bless the armed forces and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you.

Thank you.\nI actually saw great potential right across the street, to be honest with you, and it was only for the reason that the United Nations was here that that turned out to be such a successful project.\nSo I want to thank you, Ambassador Haley, for your introduction and for your steadfast advocacy for American interests on the world stage.\nOn behalf of the co-host countries, I would like to also thank Secretary General Guterres for -- and you have been fantastic -- for joining us, and we affirm our commitment to the United Nations reform. And reform is what we're talking about.\nI applaud the Secretary General for laying out a vision to reform the United Nations so that it better serves the people we all represent. We support your efforts to look across the entire system and to find ways the United Nations can better, and be better at development, management, peace, and security.\nThe United Nations was founded on truly noble goals. These include affirming the dignity and worth of the human person and striving for international peace. The United Nations has helped advance toward these goals in so many ways: feeding the hungry, providing disaster relief, and empowering women and girls in many societies all across the world.\nYet in recent years, the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement. While the United Nations on a regular budget has increased by 140 percent, and its staff has more than doubled since 2000, we are not seeing the results in line with this investment. But I know that under the Secretary General, that's changing and it's changing fast. And we've seen it.\nThat's why we commend the Secretary General and his call for the United Nations to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy. We seek a United Nations that regains the trust of the people around the world. In order to achieve this, the United Nations must hold every level of management accountable, protect whistle-blowers and focus on results rather than on process.\nTo honor the people of our nations, we must ensure that no one and no member state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden, and that's militarily or financially. We also ask that every peacekeeping mission have clearly defined goals and metrics for evaluating success. They deserve to see the value in the United Nations, and it is our job to show it to them.\nWe encourage the Secretary General to fully use his authority to cut through the bureaucracy, reform outdated systems, and make firm decisions to advance the U.N.'s core mission. Further, we encourage all member states to look at ways to take bold stands at the United Nations with an eye toward changing business as usual and not being beholden to ways of the past which were not working.\nMr. Secretary General, the United States and the member states present today support this great reform vision. We pledge to be partners in your work, and I am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms, the United Nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just, and greater force for peace and harmony in the world.\nThank you, Mr. Secretary General. And I look forward to advancing these shared goals in the years to come, and it is a great honor to be with you today.\nThank you.

More importantly, thank you for your strong leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nOur services to our veterans are getting better every day because of the leadership of our President and because of Secretary David Shulkin. Would you join me in thanking him one more time for the great work that he's doing? (Applause.)\nAnd it is great to be with all of you today, humbling in fact, to be among so many American heroes -- so many Hoosier heroes -- veterans of the Lafayette Honor Flight.

I'm going to be jumping on Air Force Two in just a little bit and headed to catch up with the President in New York City, where there's a lot going on this week with the U.N. General Assembly.\nBut it really is my great honor to be able to welcome you all here today. And to share a few remarks about your service and the ongoing commitment, not only of this administration but the people of the United States to all of the men and women who have served and who are serving this country.\nBut before I go one step further, I expect there's probably some Air Force in the room, and I'm told that today is the 70th birthday of the United States Air Force. So let's hear it. (Applause.)\nThe Old Book says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And I'm just here today on behalf of your President and our entire administration to pay a debt of gratitude, a debt of honor, and a debt of respect to each and every one of you who stepped up -- stepped forward and put on the uniform of the United States in your time.\nAs the President said recently, \"You are part of a long unbroken chain of American heroes.\"\nAnd behalf on your Commander-in-Chief and all the American people, thank you for your service. Thank you for your selfless defense of our families and the way you've stood and fought for freedom. You are in a very real sense, the best of us. We owe you a debt we can never fully repay.\nEach of you served in Vietnam, I'm told, on that frontline of freedom. Amidst the jungles and the rice paddies, you stood strong. And the image of your courage is forever seared into the mind of the American people. As our 40th President said, your cause was a \"noble cause\" and you \"fought as well and as bravely as any Americans have ever fought in any war.\"\nAnd on behalf of President Donald Trump, and my family, and a grateful America, I say to all the Vietnam veterans who are here, welcome home. (Applause.)\nToday is a part of that welcome -- an ongoing, well-deserved warm welcome home. And thanks to the Honor Flight Network, you've come here to our nation's capital, to visit, I'm told, the Vietnam Memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, and to pay your respects to those who served beside you and didn't come home.\nBefore I go further, let me just take a minute to say thank you to the Honor Flight Network and all these great red-shirt-wearing volunteers who are here with us today.\nFor more than a decade, the Honor Flight Network has brought heroes like every one of you to Washington, D.C. to see firsthand how our nation has remembered, memorialized, and immortalized your service to America.\nToday the Honor Flight Network has more than 125 hubs, including the Lafayette Honor Flight. And I'd especially like to thank not only the co-presidents, Pamela Mow and Dana Vann, who are two Gold Star moms who've organized 17 flights. Let's hear it for them. Where are they? (Applause.) But also all these red-shirt-wearing volunteers who are going to make this such a special day. Thank you. Thank you for loving our troops and thank you for your family's example.\nWe honor your service through memorials here in our nation's capital, but I know every one of you would agree with our President and myself when I say we mostly honor your service by ensuring that the men and women currently serving in harm's way have the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm pleased to report to all the veterans gathered here, President Trump has already signed the largest increase in military spending in nearly a decade. And at this very moment, we're working with the Congress to pass what will be the largest investment in military readiness since the days of Ronald Reagan.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, I promise you: As the President likes to say, we're going to make the strongest military in the world even stronger still. (Applause.)\nAnd as the President made clear in his address on Afghanistan just a little more than a month ago here at Fort Myer, we will be giving our men and women in uniform a plan for victory. And I'll promise you this, under this Commander-in-Chief, when America goes to fight, America will go to fight to win. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump is also committed to honor your service, as he likes to say, to stand with those who protected us, and he's been busy keeping his word to the men and women who have worn the uniform of this country.\nPresident Trump has been working tirelessly to empower veterans to get the care you earned and the service and sacrifice that you deserve. Whether it's at the VA or even at a private health-care provider, we've been working with the Congress to advance opportunities and legislation that expands choices for veterans.\nSecretary Shulkin has been very active in this regard, and we commend him for it. I know the President is grateful. The President actually extended the Veterans Choice program in April, and last month, he signed into law legislation that will expand the Veterans Choice program with an additional $2.1 billion per year. We're going to open the doorway to better healthcare for our veterans all across America in real time. (Applause.)\nAnd working with Secretary Shulkin and his team, our entire administration is working every day to make the VA as efficient, effective, and as accountable as each and every one of you deserve. We've already established a new White House VA hotline -- principally staffed by veterans, for veterans.\nAnd to restore the highest level of service at the VA, President Trump signed a law to enact historic protections for whistleblowers, and we're pleased to report we've already fired or suspended nearly 1,000 VA employees -- because this White House will never tolerate the mistreatment of American heroes. (Applause.)\nAs President Trump said not long ago, in his words, \"We will not rest until all of America's great veterans can receive the care they so richly deserve.\"\nAs I close, let me say what a special joy it is to have a chance to stand with so many great Hoosiers who've worn the uniform of the United States.\nMy life never took me into the armed forces, but I'm proud to say that my dad served in the United States Army and served in Korea. And I'm an especially proud father of a United States Marine.\nIt was just a few short months ago that I traveled to the country where my father saw combat. I literally stood at the -- what was the -- near the Demilitarized Zone, the 38th Parallel, as it's known, on that frontline of freedom, where South Korea meets North Korea. I looked out at the hills, and the commanding officer pointed me in the direction of where Pork Chop Hill actually was just over the horizon, where my dad fought together with his brothers in the 45th Infantry Division.\nMy dad got a Bronze Star for his service, and my family allows me to proudly display that medal in my office here in the West Wing. But I got to be honest with you, when my brothers and sisters and I were growing up, Dad didn't keep that medal on his desk. It wasn't framed and on the wall. It was in a drawer, where no one could see it.\nMy dad didn't talk a whole lot about his time in combat. And those of you that have seen combat, all those gathered here know whereof I speak more than I do. My dad really didn't consider himself a hero. Whenever we'd ask him about it, he'd say, the heroes were my friends that didn't come home.\nIn just a few hours, you all are going to have an opportunity to go pay your respects at the Vietnam Memorial and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. And I know you're going to be feeling just exactly the same way.\nBut all of you here today I know carry a burden in your heart. And I just -- I want you all to know that -- while it's something I think civilians like me will never fully understand, just know that you carry the deepest respect of the American people and all of those who have prospered under the freedom and the liberty that you defended.\nAnd as you carry this burden deep in your hearts, just know that you don't carry it alone. I promise you. The American people will always be grateful for your service. We'll always stand with you and all the men and women of the armed forces, past and present.\nAnd I'll make you one more promise: The veterans of this country and the members of our armed forces will never have a better friend in the White House than President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nSo, my fellow Hoosiers, once again, welcome to Washington, D.C. It's really a great honor to be able to welcome you here to the White House, and it's a deeply humbling one -- deeply humbling for me to have the opportunity to serve here in this new capacity and deeply humbling for me to be able stand before all of you today.\nI hope today is for you as deeply meaningful as it is for me to be able to welcome you here. And so let me close simply by saying, on behalf of President Donald Trump and all the American people, thank you for your service.\nMay God bless each and every one of you and all those that will be remembered in your Honor Flight today and may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-09-18", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President to Indiana Honor Flight Veterans and Volunteers"}

Fly-Fight-Win.\" Thanks to their selfless actions, America remains a beacon of liberty and hope around the world. May God bless each of you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-09-18", "title": "Statement on the 70th Birthday of the United States Air Force"}

It's a great honor to be with President Macron of France, who's had one of the great election victories of all time, I will tell you. That was an exciting evening. (Laughter.) And I must say that I watched every moment of it. It was a very, very exciting time.\nHe's doing a terrific job in France. He's doing what has to be done. He's respected by the French people, and I can tell you he's respected by the people of the United States.\nSo we have a lot of things to talk about. We'll be discussing many different elements. I'm not sure we should discuss all of it with the media -- (laughter) -- but they'll probably know before we know.\nSo I just want to thank you all for being here. I want to thank your representatives for being here, many of whom I know already. And we will have very productive meetings. France is a great country, it's a beautiful country. I won't soon forget our dinner on top of the Eiffel Tower where we really got to know each other and our families. And thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT MACRON: Thank you, Donald. Thank you, everybody. I will say a few words. I totally concur with Donald on what did you state, so I will just say a few words in French for the French people here.\n(President Macron speaks French.) (No English interpretation provided.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, thank you very much, Emmanuel. And I do want to say that I was your guest at Bastille Day, and it was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen. It was two hours on the button, and it was military might, and I think a tremendous thing for France and for the spirit of France.\nAnd people don't know what great warriors they are in France, but when you see that and you see all the victories, it was a tremendous thing. And to a large extent, because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on July 4th in Washington, down Pennsylvania Avenue. (Laughter.) I don't know. We're going to have to try and top it. But we had a lot of planes going over and we had a lot of military might, and it was really a beautiful thing to see. They had representatives from different wars and different uniforms. It was really so well done.\nBut I came back, and one of my early calls were, I think we're going to have to start looking at that ourselves. So we're actually thinking about 4th of July, Pennsylvania Avenue, having a really great parade to show our military strength.\nYou know, we're spending this year $700 billion -- more than we've ever spent on the military -- which is a good thing for you because we're friends. Okay? And I think we're looking forward to doing that. I'm speaking with General Kelly and with all of the people involved, and we'll see if we can do it this year. But we certainly will be beginning to do that.\nSo I appreciate it. And again, most importantly, I appreciate you being here. Thank you, Emmanuel.\nPRESIDENT MACRON: Thank you. And I have to say just for the American people, that our people in France were very proud to have you and your wife, Melania, in Paris the 14th of July, for Bastille Day. And people were very proud to have you in front of them and participating to this ceremony and this parade.\nThanks very much for your presence.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I was proud to be there. And also, when Emmanuel called me, he said, it's the 100th year in terms of timing of the first world war. One hundred years. And I said, well, that's a very important period. So we went and really -- I was very proud to say that we're very, very, very good friends with France. That was a beautiful day. And thank you very much.

It's a great honor.\nI had a long conversation with President Xi of China this morning. We discussed some of the obvious things, and we discussed trade, and we also discussed a place called North Korea. It was a long call. It was a very good call. We have a very, very fine relationship, and let's see what happens. I think we're making great progress.\nAnd we are going to be going to China during the month of November. You probably have it in your schedules, and I look very much forward to that.\nAnd I'm thrilled to host this important dinner with leaders of some of the greatest allies in the Western Hemisphere, and that is so true.\nWe're here to discuss the growing crisis in Venezuela. The socialist dictatorship of Nicolбs Maduro has inflicted terrible misery and suffering on the good people of that country. His corrupt regime destroyed a thriving nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and despair everywhere it has been tried.\nTo make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule. The Venezuelan people are starving, and their country is collapsing. It was one of the wealthiest countries in the world for a long period of time. And now the people are starving and the country is collapsing. Who would think that's possible?\nTheir democratic institutions are being destroyed. The situation is completely unacceptable. As responsible neighbors and friends of the Venezuelan people, our goal must be to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.\nI'd like to thank the leaders in this room. We have some great leaders in this room, and I want to thank them for condemning the regime and providing the vital support to the Venezuelan people. Most of the media, the press, a lot of other leaders have no idea the tremendous job that the people, without exception, in this room are doing as leaders of their country in helping the people of Venezuela.\nAnd I can tell you, we really appreciate it. And the world really appreciates it. So thank you all very much. We appreciate that so much.\nThe United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on the path to imposing authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.\nWe're fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with all of the countries gathered here today. They're doing very well with the United States. We want to try and change that a little bit so we can turn the tables just a little bit. You're doing very well, and I congratulate you all.\nNikki knows exactly what I'm saying, and Rex knows exactly what I'm saying. But we have great relationships, and we do great trade. Our economic bonds form a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.\nI ask every country represented here to be prepared to do more to address this unbelievably serious crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela, and we want it to happen very, very soon.\nSo again, I'd like to thank everybody. We look forward to having dinner with you, and we will talk individually about what ideas you may have concerning Venezuela and other situations that we're also dealing on, including trade.\nMr. Vice President, thank you very much for being here. Would you like to say a word, Mike?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. It was my great honor to represent you and the United States in a trip through Latin America, and it is good to see many of the leaders that extended their hospitality to the United States.\nAnd I echo your strong affirmation of the partnerships that are represented at this table -- partnerships for prosperity, partnerships for security, and we look forward to continuing to work with all the leaders at this table to promote the mutual prosperity of all of our nations throughout this hemisphere. And it's an honor to be here, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Mike. And Rex, would you like to say something? Secretary of State.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Mr. President, let me just add, first, my welcome to all of you to the dinner as well with the President. And these are all very important countries to the United States' relationship in the Western Hemisphere economically, but also from a security standpoint. We have many, many shared issues to fight against crime, fight against corruption, narcotics trade, and all of you are very important in the cooperation that we receive in working together toward these shared goals.\nSo, very pleased to be with all of you tonight.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And Nikki Haley, thank you so much for the job you've done over the last long time to just put it together. We had incredible meetings today with France and with Israel. The two leaders -- and they're great leaders, and we covered a lot of territory. And we have a lot of agreement, I can tell you that.\nSo we've done a lot, and we're going to be doing a lot more, I understand, for the next four days. So, Nikki, would you say a few words?\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: We just want to welcome everyone to New York. I can tell you that in the United Nations, really, your ambassadors are great friends. And we have started to work really closely together because your region matters, and the partnerships and the friendships need to be solid so we don't wait until crisis hits, but that we are already partnering in every way that we can.\nSo thank you for taking the time to be here, and enjoy New York.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well thank you, Nikki, and thank you, Rex, and thank you, Mike.

SANDERS: This is the quietest I think I've ever seen this group of people.\nThe President has had a full day of engagements on his first day of the U.N. General Assembly. This morning, he spoke by phone with the President of China on the need to keep the pressure on North Korea.\nAt the U.N., he participated in a meeting and gave remarks on reforming the United Nations as an institution so that it better lives up to the founding ideas.\nThe President supports the Secretary-General's reform agenda for the United Nations, and was pleased to join nearly 130 countries and support a big, bold reform to eliminate inefficiency.\nThe President then spent some of time with his national security team going over tomorrow's address to the General Assembly, which will be his first. I know you heard from a senior White House official on that earlier, and as a reminder, those comments are embargoed until 9:00 p.m. tonight. If you didn't get that, let our press team know and we'll make sure we send you the transcript.\nIn the afternoon, the President participated in two bilateral meetings, one with the Prime Minister of Israel and the other with the President of France. We'll have readouts of those meetings shortly.\nTonight he will host a working dinner with key Latin American leaders to discuss the crisis in Venezuela. And we'll also have a readout of that dinner.\nTomorrow will be another big day, but before we get to tomorrow, I'd like to introduce Brian Hook. Brian is the Director of Policy at the State Department and Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State. He participated in today's meetings and engagements and can give you more detail on those.\nThe ground rules are that Brian will speak on the record but off camera, and his remarks are embargoed until the conclusion of the briefing. He'll be happy to take questions from you guys specific to activities ongoing here at the U.N. If you have questions beyond that scope, the press team is happy to follow up with you after by email or phone. As you know, we're here and happy to help.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Thanks, guys.\nQ: It's embargoed until the end?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, embargoed until the end.\nQ: On the record?\nMS. SANDERS: On the record, but off camera.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. HOOK: Hi there. Good to be with you. Why don't I start first with Israel, which was the first of the two meetings that the President had.\nThe President and Prime Minister Netanyahu had a very good meeting. They reviewed progress on shared priorities, especially around Iran and Syria. They also discussed the Middle East peace process.\nThe President reaffirmed America's unshakable bond with the Jewish state. He is committed to Israel's security. They discussed at length countering Iran's malign influence in the region. And in Syria, they discussed defeating ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups.\nThey discussed the Middle East peace process. The President believes that peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians is possible. He is deeply committed to achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. He and his team have continued deliberations with leaders on both sides on potential steps to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. His team recently had multiple meetings with leaders in the region, and obviously a good deal of work remains to be done, but discussions remain serious and constructive.\nOn the France meeting, the three topics that were primarily discussed were Iran, countering Iran's malign activities, especially in Syria; they discussed Hurricane Irma; and they also discussed the Paris Agreement.\nPresident Trump considers President Macron a very, very good friend. They actually spent the first part of their meeting reminiscing about the President's trip to France and talked at length about the Bastille Day Parade and celebrating America's oldest alliance and discussing, when he was there, commemorating America's entry into World War I.\nWith respect to Iran, they both share the same concern and high priority around countering Iran's malign activities in the region. And one of the things that's common to both the meetings with the French and the Israelis is this deep and abiding concern about Iran's activities in Syria, and broadly -- whether it's in Yemen or Syria, Iraq, Lebanon.\nOne of the things they discussed was not allowing the \"Lebanization\" of Syria, and -- this is in the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But it was common to both meetings, discussing the kind of work ahead to address Iran's work around ballistic missiles, the nuclear program, and its range of destabilizing activities in the region.\nThe President of France thanked the President for the relief that the United States provided in the context of Hurricane Irma, and these are two countries who were both hit very hard by the recent hurricanes. And so they discussed St. Maartens and St. Barts; and as I mentioned, Iran, climate and Paris, and they discussed briefly the Middle East peace process.\nThat's the summary of the two meetings, happy to take any questions.\nQ: With respect to the parade, it sounds like it's something the President is thinking about quite a bit. So I'm wondering -- is the State Department being consulted about it? And do you have a view on the brandishing of U.S. military power down on Pennsylvania Avenue and how that might affect the world?\nMR. HOOK: Well, President Trump said to President Macron that it was a very inspiring parade -- the way it was executed, how they did it, the way they presented France's military history. He said the spirit of France was brought alive by the parade.\nAnd he, I think, took away a lot of good examples from that. What will happen in the future -- unclear. But he was very inspired by it.\nQ: Do you think it's needed? Does the State Department think it's needed to have something like that in Washington, D.C.?\nMR. HOOK: Don't have a comment on that, just that the President was very inspired by the parade.\nQ: Brian, can you flesh out what you mean by a \"Lebanization\" of Syria, and the degree to which the post-battlefield discussion about Syria and Iraq occurred in these two meetings?\nMR. HOOK: Iran takes advantage of failed states, and civil wars, and wars generally. It is the kind of environment that is conducive to activating their proxy network, and they are doing that in Syria. And it is the policy of the United States to deny them that space in Syria and to do what we can to prevent Iran from establishing any deep roots in Syria.\nAnd so this is a concern identical to -- the Israelis have the same concern. And so it's something that we're very focused on. We are in the process of destroying and defeating ISIS. And as we're also working toward stabilizing Syria, there will be a period then -- post-civil war. And we are keeping a very close eye on Iranian activities in Syria and working with our partners, as best we can, to deny Iran the space to organize in Syria, whether it's against us or it's against the Israelis.\nQ: Brian, the U.S. has until the middle of next month to certify the Iran deal. Should we -- the President said today that we would find out soon his thinking on this. Is this something we should anticipate in some form to come during the United Nations visit here? Or what should we be anticipating in terms of any sort of declarative statements about the status of that?\nMR. HOOK: Well, I don't want to preview the President's speech tomorrow, but Iran is something, as I said, that is a foreign policy -- a national security priority for the United States.\nWith respect to the JCPOA, there is an INARA certification coming up on October 15th, and that decision is still under review by the President with the Secretary of State and his national security cabinet. So I don't want to prejudge that decision. It's still another month or so away, but the policy is under review.\nBut I will say that, on Iran, we are taking a comprehensive approach to the range of Iran activities -- its threat network, its ballistic missile systems, its nuclear program. And that is something which I think is very much needed after the Iran deal.\nI think the Iran deal became a proxy for an Iran policy, and we are trying to take a comprehensive approach and bringing in all of Iran's activities -- terrorism, nukes, missiles, regional instability -- so that we're not substituting the Iran deal for an Iran policy.\nQ: Did President Trump speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu about what he thinks should be the endgame of the peace process? And did he mention if he supports the principle of a two-state solution?\nMR. HOOK: What we have been -- what the President has been talking about in the context of Middle East peace is trying to avoid bumper stickers and slogans around this. He does not want to impose a solution. And what he's really trying to do is work as a facilitator to find a solution that both sides can accept. Ambassador Friedman has talked about it in terms of a win-win for both the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nHe does want to take a new approach, and when you look at the changes in the Arab world -- and he talked a lot about this on his trip -- his first international trip where he first started in Saudi Arabia and then went on to the Vatican and then Israel -- you do have changes in the Arab world. And I think specifically there is a growing recognition of the common threat from Iran. And -- you have a new administration, you have a different mindset in the region, and that, I think, is creating an environment that is more conducive to a peace agreement.\nBut the President very much believes that this is propitious time and an important time. You've got an environment broadly that is very conducive to negotiations. We're taking a new approach. He's got a great team who is working on this with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt and Ambassador Friedman, Dina Powell. They recently made a trip to the region, and they're meeting with all sides. And this is a way of trying to facilitate; it's a facilitation role and not imposing a solution on the outside.\nAnd so I think today they did have a good discussion about it, and I think they're both pleased with the kind of progress -- this is very early stages, and we shouldn't expect major breakthroughs right now or detailed proposals quite yet. But that team that I just described with President is focusing a lot of energy around that.\nYeah.\nQ: How much time did the Israeli-Palestinian issue take up of the meeting? And is the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu on the same page of taking the next step towards relaunching negotiations?\nMR. HOOK: I didn't keep a stopwatch, in terms of just how long everybody discussed each subject. As I said, they spent a lot of time talking about Iran and about Syria -- Middle East peace.\nI would say it was an equitable distribution of topics. I think each was given the time necessary needed to kind of give it full justice. So, it was a very good discussion.\nBut these discussions are so regular, it wasn't a lot of time that had elapsed because the trip that Jared and his team recently made was only a few weeks ago. And so, we're in regular discussions with the Israelis.\nFelicia.\nQ: Going back to the meeting with Macron. You said that you're taking a more regional approach, you're looking more at the totality of Iran's behavior. Can you talk about any of the specifics that you discussed at with the French about what they might be willing to do, I guess, on the sidelines of the deal?\nMR. HOOK: What's that last part? I didn't understand the last part.\nQ: Just what agreements are the French willing to make in the context of the JCPOA and that you're looking to strengthen the policy?\nMR. HOOK: The President believes that the JCPOA is deeply flawed, and he did share his views with President Macron about how he believes the deal is flawed. And they talked about the sunset, the lack of a sunset, and the kind of advantages that this deal -- this one-sided deal -- accrues to Iran.\nAnd so the President was very candid with him about what he thinks of the shortcomings of the JCPOA. He said that, as I said earlier, he told him that it is under review, and that they are taking a hard look at the October 15th decision, and more broadly how to fix the Iran deal.\nBut they also did discuss this integrated strategy that I was talking about earlier. When you look at the support for terrorism, the ballistic missile program, destabilization in the Middle East, and other aggressions -- I mean, France has been on the receiving end of Iran's aggressive actions. And so they feel this acutely.\nAnd so I felt like there was a lot of agreement about the areas of focus. And so I think that was very encouraging. The discussion was very encouraging about Iran.\nYes.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit more about the conversation about the Paris Agreement with President Macron?\nMR. HOOK: On the Paris Agreement, the President talked through that he believes it's just simply unfair -- that he thought other countries, particularly China, received a better deal than the United States negotiated. And he talked about the consequence of the Paris Agreement for American workers, American industries, and the American economy.\nI think the United States and France do have differing views on the benefits of that agreement to our two countries. But they did both discuss -- I think there is agreement, the President talked about this, about clean air, clean water, protecting the environment, and promoting economic growth. The President believes that we can achieve these things. He does not believe that the Paris Agreement is a framework to achieve those goals around clean energy, protecting the environment, and promoting economic growth.\nHe did say that he's very proud of America's record on clean energy and on being a leader in clean technology. And he wants to work with France and other countries on technology and policy innovations that balance this need for both protecting the environment and for economic growth.\nQ: If I may, was there any discussion about maybe renegotiating the Paris deal? I know that the President has said he's open to that if it's more fair to America's workers. Did he lay out any of those parameters?\nMR. HOOK: The President focused repeatedly, in their meeting, on fairness. And it was a theme that he returned to again and again -- that he thought that it was badly negotiated. He also thought the Iran deal was badly negotiated. And so he has inherited the Paris Agreement and the Iran deal.\nAnd he thinks that if you -- I think he is very open to considering a number of different options, as long as they are fair to America's interests, which include promoting the economy, protecting the environment -- a range of those things.\nAnd so, as I said, I do think that there is an agreement on the priorities. He doesn't think that the Paris Agreement is the best vehicle to achieve the priorities around protecting the environment because it advantages other countries, especially China, more than it helps the United States.\nQ: Going back to the JCPOA, you spoke a bit about what President Trump said, but what did President Macron say about his position on the JCPOA? Is he open to reopening it? Is he okay with President Trump decertifying it? Is he open to supplemental agreements? I mean, could you please be specific on that front?\nMR. HOOK: That's a question for President Macron. I don't want to speak for him. His team is best -- I mean, I really don't want to speak for him. He was in the meeting and he's got a team, and I don't want to misspeak or miscapture. You really should ask him.\nBut they did -- I'm telling you, they had a very good discussion about it. But I don't want to explain France's position on the JCPOA. They've done that publicly. And so, they had a good discussion about it.\nQ: But broadly, though -- you said that they had differing views on climate change, on the Paris Agreement. Would you say, broadly, they had differing views on the Iran deal?\nMR. HOOK: They actually spent most of their time talking about Iran's terrorist activities in the Middle East. Now, they did discuss the Iran deal, but there really is a need for us to take a comprehensive approach to Iran, and he really understood that.\nAnd so, this was not a one-sided discussion about the JCPOA. It was a very helpful discussion and a very encouraging discussion. Obviously, France, during the negotiation of the JCPOA, expressed some concerns about the deal. They still have those concerns. But it really is beyond just the Iran deal.\nThe Iran deal is an arms control political agreement. And it's one piece of all of the issues that exist between Iran, the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world, and the rest of the world. And so, we were very encouraged that there is a convergence of views to take a comprehensive approach to what Iran is doing.\nQ: Following up on the climate change discussion, I understand that the President emphasized fairness, but there have been some questions, after Secretary Tillerson's comments over the weekend and also after the meeting this morning between Gary Cohn and some other ministers about what would be considered fair terms for renegotiation. Can you outline what those would be and whether the President addressed that specifically?\nMR. HOOK: They did not get into specific terms in this bilateral meeting on what -- there wasn't a detailed discussion about fairness, in terms of all of the elements of it. It was more of a discussion around how the President views it, but it was very broadly.\nAnd he did -- as I said, he emphasized fairness but it was not -- there's a lot to cover in a bilat, and there's only a certain amount of time to go through these things. And so I think a lot of the details will end up being left to Gary and the NEC, which has been leading the interagency process on climate policy. And that's something, probably, going to be worked out with Gary and his counterparts.\nQ: A question on Syria diplomacy. The French are pushing this idea of a new contact group. Did that come up in the discussion between the two Presidents? What's the view from the U.S. side of this proposal? And, I suppose, the sticky bit -- what's the view about whether Iran could be a member of that contact group?\nMR. HOOK: I'm trying to remember. On Syria, we have a lot of joint efforts in Syria with the French. We talked about the ceasefire and the de-escalation zone in southwest Syria. They talked about ways that our governments can work better together to continue enforcing the ceasefire and making it a success.\nThey talked about chemical weapons. The President discussed how important it was to enforce the international ban against chemical weapons. And the missiles -- the 59 missiles that were sent into Syria -- was meant to galvanize and sort of re-galvanize global opposition to chemical weapons and the use of chemical weapons.\nAnd so they did discuss chemical weapons, and talked about the progress that they're making destroying ISIS in its physical caliphate, preventing its return to liberated areas, and stopping ISIS fighters from returning to conduct attacks. That was --\nQ: But the contact group ideas that the French are floating -- did that come up?\nMR. HOOK: That was discussed very briefly.\nQ: I wanted to step back for a second, more generally, and ask you if you could help many of us understand a little bit about how the President is viewing his time here generally and his speech tomorrow, from a broad sense.\nIn terms of -- we heard earlier today that the administration and the President is not interested in nation-building, not interested in using the military to promote democracy, not interested in telling other people how to live or what kind of governments they want to have. Does the President see his time here as promoting the United States just for -- to try to prove the U.S. position in the world? Or does he see his time here and his speech as a way to reaffirm the U.S. as something to -- as sort of a symbol of democracy and human rights and freedom around the world, as something other countries should strive for?\nMR. HOOK: I don't want to get ahead of the President's speech tomorrow, and so I won't. This will be his first address to the U.N. General Assembly. The President has been working very well with the U.N. Security Council. We've used it in a number of different ways, especially, most recently, with North Korea.\nAnd the U.N. Security Council resolutions -- we often don't get everything we want. They're often diluted by members of the P5, but they are a force-multiplier to bring a global approach to global threats.\nAnd so I would just say that, so far in this administration, the President has worked well with the U.N. Security Council to try to leverage it for the purposes that the U.N. Charter created, which is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. And I think the President will, like most presidents, be talking about the ideals of the U.N. and its charter, and how we have worked with the U.N. Security Council to be addressing threats to international peace and security. But beyond that, I'll let the President speak for himself tomorrow.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a broad question about these kind of multilateral agreements. The President seems to have taken the view that many of the agreements that were created before he came into office were kind of rubbish and he can do a better job. Why do you think that is? Why do you think he takes that approach?\nMR. HOOK: In terms of the Iran deal and the Paris deal?\nQ: And I'm thinking NAFTA, I'm thinking T-PP, I'm thinking JCPOA --\nMR. HOOK: In my space, in foreign policy, of the areas that you mentioned that I work on, are Iran and -- specifically for me, around the Iran deal and JCPOA. And so Gary Cohn has been leading on climate.\nI would just say that the President does not believe that these were well-negotiated. It's really not a knock on multilateralism. I think it really is just a matter of negotiating. Whether it's a bilateral or a multilateral or a trilateral deal, at the end of the day, the terms are what matters.\nI think he focuses much more on the outcome than he does on the process. And so, I think he's fairly agnostic on the process. In the case of the Iran deal, that was P5+1, and it was a -- he believes that it was a very badly negotiated deal that does not advance America's national security interests. And he thinks that -- so it's under review.\nAnd so I really don't think it's anything particular about the process. It's more about the outcome.\nMS. SANDERS: We have time for one more question.\nQ: I better make it good. (Laughter.) This was sort of touched on earlier, but the idea of the framework of Paris not being the right way to move forward, but the idea that there could be some other way to move forward -- I just don't understand how to process that. I mean, does that mean that the U.S. is going to get back into a climate deal, it's just not going to be called the Paris climate deal and are those talks proceeding apace?\nAnd I'm going to take a stab at a speech question while I'm here. Did Secretary of State Tillerson have input into this speech -- the writing of the speech, the shaping of the speech, the points that the President was making? Has he been a full part of the consultative process? And has the U.N. Ambassador as well?\nMR. HOOK: Yes, he has. Secretary Tillerson -- yes, he has.\nQ: And Haley as well?\nMR. HOOK: I don't know.\nQ: And on the Paris one?\nMR. HOOK: On Paris -- is it the question of what? I'm still not quite sure what you mean.\nQ: Maybe I'm reading too much into what you were saying. It sounded like you were saying that the U.S. believes in the goals of doing clean energy things that are environmentally sound, they just think that Paris itself is too flawed to be the right framework for it. So maybe we've all been thinking about this the wrong way. Instead of figuring out whether the U.S. is getting back into Paris, should we be trying to figure out whether there's going to be something called, you know, \"Manhattan 2018\" or whatever?\nMR. HOOK: Going back to what I said earlier about the outcome, I think the focus for the President, with respect to climate is getting a fair deal. He did say to President Macron that he looks forward to continuing discussions with him. He is, I think, open to a number of different approaches that properly balance protecting the environment, and protecting American workers, and promoting economic growth, and not giving an unfair advantage to other countries while America is disadvantaged.\nAnd so I think there are obviously many different ways to reach an agreement around that. And we've seen various versions of that, whether it's around the environment or national security or trade -- any number of things. But the President is very open to an outcome that achieves fairness in the areas that I mentioned.\nOkay, thank you.\nEND 5:43 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128326", "text": "Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.\nAs millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.\nFortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high -- a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.\nOur military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.\nWe live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.\nBut each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.\nAuthority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.\nInternational criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.\nTo put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.\nWe have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.\nThis institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.\nIt was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars -- they're pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.\nThe Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, \"Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.\"\nTo overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.\nWe do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.\nStrong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.\nStrong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.\nIn America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.\nThis timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.\nThe greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are: \"We the people.\"\nGenerations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.\nIn foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.\nAs President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)\nAll responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.\nBut making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.\nThe United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America's interests above all else.\nBut in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it's in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.\nAmerica does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.\nIt is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.\nFor the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.\nThat realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?\nIf we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.\nThe scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.\nIf the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.\nNo one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.\nWe were all witness to the regime's deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator's brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.\nIf this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.\nIt is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.\nThe United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That's what the United Nations is all about; that's what the United Nations is for. Let's see how they do.\nIt is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.\nBut we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.\nWe face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime -- one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.\nThe Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran's leaders are, in fact, its own people.\nRather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran's people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship, fuel Yemen's civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.\nWe cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it -- believe me.\nIt is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran's government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.\nThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.\nOppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation's proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?\nThe Iranian regime's support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.\nIn Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.\nWe will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.\nWe must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.\nThe United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.\nLast month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.\nI have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.\nWe seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens -- even innocent children -- shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.\nWe appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.\nThe United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.\nFor the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.\nFor decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.\nFor the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.\nFor the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.\nI want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.\nWe have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President's Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.\nWe also thank -- (applause) -- we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.\nIn some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution's noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.\nThe United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.\nMajor portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.\nThe American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.\nThat is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.\nWe have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.\nThe socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.\nThe Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.\nAs a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.\nThe United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.\nWe are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.\nI ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)\nThe problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.\nAmerica stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.\nIn America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.\nFor too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.\nWhile America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America's strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.\nIf this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the \"independent strength of its members.\" If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations -- nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.\nIn remembering the great victory that led to this body's founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.\nPatriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.\nToday, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.\nWe cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats -- we can't do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.\nThe true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?\nOne of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was \"effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.\"\nThat was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.\nThe United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.\nNow we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.\nHistory is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.\nOur hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.\nThis is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.\nSo let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.
