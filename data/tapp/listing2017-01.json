Trump today announced that he intends to nominate Robert Lighthizer as U.S. Trade Representative.\nAmbassador Lighthizer served under President Ronald Reagan as Deputy United States Trade Representative, playing a major role in developing trade policy for the Reagan Administration and negotiating roughly two dozen bilateral international agreements on a variety of topics from steel to grain. These agreements were uniformly tough and frequently resulted in significant reductions in the shipment of unfairly traded imports into the United States.\nIn his new role, Ambassador Lighthizer will work in close coordination with Secretary of Commerce-designate Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, head of the newly created White House National Trade Council, to develop and implement policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand economic growth, strengthen our manufacturing base and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores.\n\"Ambassador Lighthizer is going to do an outstanding job representing the United States as we fight for good trade deals that put the American worker first,\" said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \"He has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans. He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.\"\n\"It is a very high honor to represent our nation and to serve in President-elect Trump's administration as the U.S. Trade Representative,\" said Ambassador Robert Lighthizer. \"I am fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.\"\nAmbassador Lighthizer has long been a leader in U.S. trade policy, and has extensive experience in the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the private sector. Aside from his service in the Reagan Administration, he was Chief of Staff of the United States Senate Committee of Finance when Congress passed the Reagan program of tax cuts and spending reductions, and also aided in the passage of legislation which implemented the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations. He has also represented the United States at meetings of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and meetings related to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the precursor to the World Trade Organization).\nAmbassador Lighthizer headed up the international trade law practice at Skadden, Arps Slate, Meagher and Flom for over three decades. He has represented American manufacturers in many of the largest and most significant trade cases of the last 25 years, such as the steel safeguard case of the early 2000s – the last time any president granted global safeguard relief. He has worked on scores of successful cases that resulted in reducing unfair imports and helping thousands of American workers and numerous businesses.\nAmbassador Lighthizer has also been an outspoken commentator on trade issues, giving speeches and writing articles for the New York Times and other publications, as well as providing testimony to key Congressional committees, the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, and other government agencies with responsibility for trade policy. He graduated from Georgetown University and the Georgetown University Law Center.", "timestamp": "2017-01-03", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for corrections, marked with an asterisk.\n1:20 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy New Year. Hope you all got some quality time with your families over the last couple of weeks. I know the President did while he was in Hawaii, and I hope you were able to do the same thing.\nBefore we get started, I actually wanted to mark a little -- a memory with all of you. Today actually reflects the 9th anniversary of the President's victory in the Iowa caucuses. And I was fortunate enough to have worked on his Iowa caucus campaign, and so this is a day that I know that many of my colleagues at the time will mark in their own way. I thought I would actually do it by reading just a couple of short excerpts from the speech that he delivered that night.\nThis was the President speaking to a group of very excited supporters. There are some famous lines in this speech, but my attention, as I was reading this last night actually was attracted to a couple of different paragraphs -- and let me read them to you now.\n\"Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the place where America remembered what it means to hope. For months, we've been teased, even derided for talking about hope. We always knew that hope is not blind optimism. It's not ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path. It's not sitting on the sidelines, or shrinking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.\"\nHe went on to say that \"Hope is the bedrock of this nation; the belief that our destiny will not be written for us but by us, by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, but who have the courage to remake the world as it should be.\"\nI didn't deliver that speech nearly as well as he did that night. And I certainly --\nQ: It was a dramatic read.\nMR. EARNEST: I tried. I tried. (Laughter.) I gave it the old college try. And I certainly can't take credit for having written this powerful speech. But I think it is an apt illustration of how remarkably committed President Obama has been over the course of his presidential career to a core set of principles that aspire to something great; that put their hope in the American people to build the kind of country that we all believe in, where we all have an opportunity to succeed regardless of what we look like or where we come from.\nAnd there's a reference in this to \"those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, but who have the courage to remake the world as it should be.\" The President was talking about all Americans who are committed to investing in this country. But I have very vivid memories of the young men and women who signed up to work on President Obama's campaign back in 2007 for the 2008 caucuses. And I say young men and women because even back at the time, nine years ago, when I was at the ripe old age of 32, I was the old guy, and that our campaign was populated by young people -- not young people in their 20s and 30s, but young people in their 20s.\nAnd I have a vivid memory of one fall afternoon -- it was in the middle of the week. The Winneshiek County Democrats in Northeastern Iowa were hosting their fall dinner, and there were two Obama campaign organizers who were eager to have somebody from the campaign come and speak at the fall gathering for all the Democrats. This was a prime opportunity to recruit supporters and other influential people in the community, particularly Democrats, to win over their support.\nAnd the campaign, unfortunately, was not able to find anyone for them, so I went up there. (Laughter.) And so I made the more than four-hour drive from Des Moines, Iowa, to Decorah, Iowa -- Winneshiek County is in the northeastern part of the state. And what I found there were two Obama campaign organizers, two young people who were utterly committed to the task. It was this young woman from Tennessee and a young African American man. And I point that out because I don't think there are too many other people in Winneshiek County that either had a southern accent like that young lady did, or were African American like that young man.\nBut what I found in the few hours that I was in town with them is they knew everybody. When I got there, I pulled into their office and they said, well, you must be thirsty after your long drive. They said, let's go down to the grocery store and we'll get you something to drink. And they were walking through the grocery store aisles greeting people by name, and greeting the clerk who was checking us out by name. And we went to the county dinner, and it was a small affair at an outdoor shelter at a park in Winneshiek County, and they were greeting everybody by name. And I remember that night after the dinner I took them out for a couple of drinks at a local bar, and they're greeting the bartender and other people at the bar by name.\nIt was an indication of how these two people were so committed to the cause and so passionate that they mustered the courage to go to some place that they had never been, to a community where they were very obviously outsiders, because of the passion that they felt for President Obama and his vision for the future of the country.\nSo I appreciate you indulging me on the anniversary of the victory to talk about the warm memories that I have of this important event, not just in the history of the people who have supported President Obama over his career, but in the history of the country. And to all of my colleagues and friends who worked on that campaign and are marking that day today, I continue to feel the sense of solidarity and comradery with them that was so critical to our victory nine years ago.\nSo with that long wind-up, Darlene, welcome back. Happy New Year.\nQ: Same to you.\nMR. EARNEST: And let's go to some questions.\nQ: Great. So tomorrow, the President is going to the Capitol to talk to Democrats there about health care.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: What is the message? What is the goal? What does he hope to accomplish by going up there and meeting with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this will be an opportunity for the President to meet with the Democrats in the House and the Senate for the incoming United States Congress. And they'll be there to principally discuss how to counter the stated Republican objective of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nThe stakes are high. And I know that, particularly at this time, when we're thinking about -- when there's a lot of discussion about the President's legacy, that some people might think that, well, the President is very concerned about the political capital that he's invested in this and he doesn't want to see it all go away. That's certainly true. But the President's priority and the President's motivation is rooted in looking out for the interests of the 22 *30 million Americans whose health care would be taken away if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act. He's interested in looking out for the millions of Americans who get health care through their employer who have seen that the growth in their health care costs has been sharply limited -- just 3.4 percent in 2016.\nOverall, the growth in health care costs is the lowest it's been on record. And if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, they will reverse that progress. Millions of Americans across the country are protected from being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. They're allowed to keep their kids on their insurance plan until their kids turn 26. Women are not allowed to be charged more by their insurance company just because they're women. All of that would be undone if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nObviously, we're deeply concerned about the impact this would have on Medicaid and Medicare. The Affordable Care Act extended the lifespan of the Medicare trust fund by 11 years. So if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, they'll be hastening the demise of Medicare that millions of seniors rely upon for their basic health care needs.\nSo the President is deeply concerned about the impact that this Republican action could have. He's also concerned about this Republican tactic of repeal-and-delay that ultimately is nothing more than just bait-and-switch. The prospect of, oh, don't worry, the 22 *20 million Americans who have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, we'll get around to offering up a replacement at some later date. That's not a responsible way to govern, and it certainly is not an indication that you're looking out for working people in this country.\nDemocrats are, however, interested in looking out for working people in this country, no one more so than the Democratic President of the United States, Barack Obama. So that's what they'll be there to talk about, and the President's message will be to encourage them in that fight and to offer his own insight about the most effective way to engage in that fight.\nQ: Is he going to be looking in some way to exploit Republicans appearing to be divided over what to replace Obamacare with? Is that part of the discussion tomorrow? Sort of take advantage of their inability to agree on a replacement?\nMR. EARNEST: There does appear to be some division in the Republican Party. That's understandable. Many of you have told the stories of people who are represented in Congress by Republicans, who voted for those Republicans, who are pleading with those Republicans not to take away their Obamacare. So it's not surprising to me that there are some Republicans who are now a little queasy about the prospect of -- the impact that repealing Obamacare would have on their own supporters, on people in their congressional districts. Because we know there are people all across the country who benefit from this law, who are protected by this law, whose lives have been saved by this law.\nAnd the prospect of taking it away is a question of life or death for some people. And so it's not surprising to me that that does leave some Republicans queasy.\nWhat the President has long said -- and I'm sure that this is true of other Republicans on Capitol Hill -- I don't speak for them -- but the President has long been open to the idea that if there are Republicans who are genuinely interested in reforming the Affordable Care Act in a way that would strengthen the program the President would be strongly supportive of that effort. And he's put forward his own ideas for how we could do that, but he certainly would be open to ideas from Republicans to do that.\nBut that's not what Republicans have offered. What they've offered more than 50 times is just a proposal for tearing the program down in a way that would leave millions of Americans vulnerable. So there is this division in the Republican Party that does leave them vulnerable because they haven't actually indicated any desire to work with Democrats to strengthen the program, which means that there is a premium placed on Republican unity, and if they're not able to preserve that unity, it will pose a challenge to their efforts to accomplish this goal.\nBut there are a lot of steps to this process that Republicans have laid out that they're prepared to undertake, and we'll see if they are able to do them. The country would be much better served by them looking to work in a genuinely bipartisan fashion to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and not just extend, but actually strengthen the many protections that benefit millions of Americans across the country.\nQ: Last one on this. The President has said on a few occasions that his administration has been good on policy, but where it had fallen down has been in communicating policy to the public. And I'm wondering --\nMR. EARNEST: I try not to take that personally when he says that. (Laughter.)\nQ: So I'm wondering if the trip up to Capitol Hill tomorrow and then this health care-related interview that he's doing later in the week on Friday -- is this some sort of attempt to kind of do the sales job on ACA over or better?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I don't think -- I think as you all have seen in covering the President over the last eight years, there aren't many do-overs. I can't think of any. So, no, this is not a do-over. But I think this is an opportunity for the President once again to make what he finds to be a particularly persuasive argument about the benefits of the proposal.\nAnd the one thing that we have long said that has proved to be true is that the more that people understand what's included in the Affordable Care Act, the more that people see firsthand how they benefit from the Affordable Care Act, the more popular it's likely to be.\nAnd there's no denying that Obamacare has been subjected to hundreds of millions of dollars of political attacks -- many of them, if not most of them, false -- about the impact of the law. So there is stiff headwinds that we have encountered in trying to make the argument in favor of the Affordable Care Act. But the one thing that has proved to be true is that the more that people understand what's included in the Affordable Care Act and how they benefit from it, the more popular the program is and the harder it is for Republicans to build political support for tearing it down.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, North Korea has said it is close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. As the Obama administration comes close to its end, what more can you do on North Korea in the remaining three weeks of the President's term, and what kind of advice do you have for the incoming administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the most important thing that any Commander-in-Chief has to do is protect the American people. And for years, the United States has -- at the direction of the Commander-in-Chief, President Obama -- has increased the defenses that are deployed in the Pacific region to protect the American people from this threat.\nSo there are radar facilities and antiballistic missile facilities that have been installed in places like Japan and Guam and in Alaska. There are naval vessels, ballistic missile defense ships that are patrolling the Pacific Ocean. The number of them has been increased as a result of a decision made early on by the Commander-in-Chief to make sure that we could protect the American people from this threat. And I can confirm once again that the United States military does believe it has the capacity to protect the American people from the threat that's emanating from North Korea.\nBut these defenses are not the only steps that the Commander-in-Chief has ordered. The United States is also engaged in a rigorous, intensive diplomatic effort to build international support for tough sanctions against the North Korean regime. And the United Nations Security Council last fall passed the toughest resolution yet, imposing the toughest sanctions yet against the North Korean regime, putting a hard cap on the amount of coal that can be exported -- because we know that they use the revenue from those coal exports to try to fund some of these programs, so putting that hard cap in place is going to have an impact on their ability to continue to develop their programs.\nAnd we're only able to succeed in implementing those measures with the cooperation of China. And given the differences that we have with China on a number of other issues, it's no small diplomatic undertaking to get them to work effectively with us -- which they have, to their credit -- to impose some of these measures and to increase pressure on the North Korean regime.\nThe problem has not been solved, but we certainly have defenses in place to protect against the threat that emanates from there. And we certainly have made progress in building important diplomatic support to apply pressure to the North Korean regime to limit their ability to continue to develop this program, but also to give them an incentive to change their strategy. They haven't yet, but we're going to continue to apply that pressure.\nOur advice to the next administration I think will largely be to listen to the advice of our military commanders about what's necessary to protect the American people with regard to our deployments in the Pacific, and to look for opportunities to work effectively with countries like China and Russia and our allies -- South Korea and Japan -- to apply pressure to North Korea to make clear that they should renounce their nuclear ambitions and put an end to the kind of destabilizing rhetoric that we've seen all too often emanate from the North Korean capital.\nQ: Thank you. And on a separate issue. The White House's reaction to the congressional Republicans' decision to curtail and then not curtail the Office of Congressional Ethics today -- is this one of those perhaps rare instances where you agree with President-elect Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I think that it is rather revealing that the first step taken by congressional Republicans in the new Congress was to vote in secret to gut ethics regulations. These are ethics regulations, by the way, put in place by Democrats in response to ethical scandals plaguing congressional Republicans. So I note that there's a lot of talk about ethics and revolving doors, but the revolving door that we see right now is the continual challenge on the part of congressional Republicans to skirt responsibility for their ethical violations.\nWith regard to the -- well, let me also say, I suspect this is not going to be the first time that we see congressional Republicans in this Congress seeking to help people in positions of power and influence escape accountability when it comes to the interests of the American people. I'm confident we're going to see congressional Republicans do the work of their donors on Wall Street to try to gut Wall Street reform that would allow them to escape accountability for a bunch of financial transactions that we know are not in the public interest and actually do put taxpayers at risk and potentially put taxpayers on the hook for bailing out those big banks if those risky bets go bad.\nOne other thing we know congressional Republicans are likely to do is to go to their donors in the oil industry and say, hey, we can help you escape accountability for polluting the air and water and land that the American people treasure and in some cases depend on for our sustenance.\nI think the real question for the President-elect is will he stand up to them then.\nQ: Would you agree then with my, I guess, question that this is a rare instance where you agree with the President-elect's criticism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I'll let the President-elect's team explain exactly what he was intending to communicate in this tweet. It was not immediately obvious to me that he was indicating opposition to the gutting of ethical requirements. Some people at least interpreted his tweet as indicating that the optics of doing it first were bad. But again, I'll leave it to the incoming team to explain it.\nBecause the position of this administration is that people who are entrusted with positions of authority in the United States government do have certain ethical obligations and they should be held independently accountable for adhering to those ethical requirements. Certainly the executive branch does in a variety of ways.\nAnd I do recall that when President Obama served in the United States Senate, he was one of a small number of members of the United States Senate who championed legislation to create and independent ethical oversight structure on the Senate side, too. Unfortunately, that effort did not succeed. But the President's views on the importance of these kinds of ethical oversight structures are well known. And the President has long placed a priority on ensuring that they are strong.\nMichelle.\nQ: You didn't paint a very hopeful picture at one point there. But the fact that this did die, that leadership took it out, do you see that as promising at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I started out reading a speech about hope, so I try to be an optimistic guy. But what I also -- just to go back to that speech -- \"We know that hope is not blind optimism. It's not ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.\"\nSo when you have a bunch of Republicans who campaigned for their office saying that they want to gut regulations that prevent Wall Street bankers from taking advantage of middle-class families, when you have a bunch of Republicans who run for Congress saying that they're going to make it easier for their largest contributors in the oil industry to pollute our water and our air, it's hard to feel particularly optimistic about their willingness to look out for the American people.\nBut like I said, if the President-elect is willing to stand up to them in those instances that would be welcome news. So we'll just have to see exactly how that plays out. I will say that it is -- even in the face of all that optimism, it is disheartening that the very first thing that Republicans in Congress chose to do was to vote in secret to gut ethical accountability. That's not draining the swamp. But that's day one. We'll see what the days in the future lead to.\nQ: Okay. So you talked about the President on the Hill tomorrow talking to Democrats to encourage them and how best to counter gutting Obamacare. So what specifically does he want them to do? I'm confused on what there is that can be done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'll have an opportunity, as Darlene referenced, to hear from the President at greater length about this later this week. But I think you can certainly anticipate that the President will encourage Democrats to focus on those aspects of the Affordable Care Act that are strongly supported in bipartisan fashion all across the country.\nThe best example for this is the consumer protection that prevents insurance companies from discriminating against people that have preexisting conditions. There's nothing ideological or partisan about that notion. It's actually just a matter of basic fairness. And what we have found is now that that law -- or that rule has been in effect for the last few years, we've actually seen Democrats and Republicans both come together and acknowledge that that's a good idea, that actually is fair.\nAnd so the question, really, for Republicans is how do you construct a policy that protects that fairness? Right now what Republicans are suggesting is that they would basically take away the requirement that everybody has health insurance, and that ultimately is going to interfere with the ability to ensure that insurance companies sign everybody up. So that's ultimately something that Republicans are going to have to reconcile.\nAnd I think this is something the President has talked about at some length, which is that there is a difference between campaigning and governing. There's a difference between going out there on a campaign trail and using all kinds of rhetoric saying you're going to repeal the Affordable Care Act because of the impact it's having on our economy. So you have to ignore a lot of facts in order to make that kind of rhetorical statement. But once you are faced with actually implementing it, the questions get a lot harder. And your ability to follow through on that promise that sounded really good on the campaign trail is called into question.\nQ: So he wants Democrats to pressure their Republican colleagues? When you say, focus on that, what does he expect them to be doing right now?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's message to them is that they should be out there telling the stories of their constituents who are benefitting from this law. I think that's certainly the most important thing they can do.\nThere are a number of Democrats on Capitol Hill who do have ideas of things that could be done that would strengthen the Affordable Care Act. So some of them may choose to use this as an opportunity to offer up some additional suggestions and try to seek to Republican cooperation to strengthen the law. The President certainly would encourage them to do that.\nI think you can also expect to hear the President make the case that it's not just about protecting the Affordable Care Act, it's also about making sure that we're protecting Medicaid and Medicare. And if we tear down the Affordable Care Act, we're having a terribly negative impact on Medicare and Medicaid, as well. So I think there are a lot of strong, persuasive arguments to be made that would I think persuade many Americans that the idea of tearing down the Affordable Care Act is a bad idea.\nQ: Okay. And just quickly, does the administration believe that North Korea is that close to that ICBM capability? And what does the President think of Donald Trump's response to North Korea via his tweets?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can -- the intelligence community has previously said that the United States has not seen North Korea test or demonstrate the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an ICBM. I'm not aware that that assessment has changed. And some of the administration -- the intelligence community officials that I have spoken to today were not aware that that assessment has changed. If it has changed, it's something that will come from the intelligence community.\nWith regard to the President-elect's tweets, I'll let his team explain exactly what he means.\nThanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I appreciate it. Happy New Year.\nMR. EARNEST: Happy New Year to you.\nQ: Thanks. So I'm just wondering whether you've spoken with President Obama about the possibility of slapping a tariff on cars made in Mexico and imported into the U.S. and what you think the impact of that would be on foreign policy or the economy.\nMR. EARNEST: I have not spoken to President Obama about that. I know that that is contrary to the approach that President Obama has taken when it comes to trying to manage our trade relationships around the world. In fact, the President was strongly supportive of a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that his administration negotiated that included Mexico that would have raised labor standards, raised environmental standards, would have protected intellectual property, and would have made it easier and fairer for U.S. businesses that are competing against Mexican businesses. That would have been good for the U.S. economy. That would have been good for U.S. workers. It would have been good for U.S. businesses.\nThe incoming President does not seem to share that view and he believes in a different approach. And many economists have expressed concerns about how the imposition of tariffs like some have suggested would actually have a starkly negative impact on the economy because it would not just result in higher prices being paid by American customers, it means that American goods that are shipped overseas face a similar retaliatory tariff.\nAnd since we're not starting out on a level playing field, even if the tariff is equal in stature to the tariff that's imposed by the United States, it will have a disproportionate, negative impact on those American products. And many economists have made the argument that imposing a tariff like that is actually the worst of both worlds when it comes to the interests of the United States, our consumers, our workers, and our economy.\nSo that's why the President has tried a much different approach. But ultimately, the next administration will have to pursue the strategy that they believe is the best, and we'll have an opportunity to evaluate what works best.\nThe President has a very strong track record when you consider the performance of the U.S. economy under his leadership, under the economic strategy that he has put together. But the incoming President was elected on a promise to try things different -- to try different things, and to do things differently. And we'll have an opportunity to evaluate how well it works.\nQ: I just wanted to go quickly -- do you know whether President Obama has spoken with the President of Mexico? Today, perhaps?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware that they've spoken today.\nQ: And the kind of flipside to the President-elect's Twitter-related actions on car policy, the Ford Motor Company has announced that they've canceled this major expansion into Mexico and are going to preserve some jobs in the U.S. Would you say that that's good news? And would you applaud President-elect Trump for his actions on that? Or do you know enough about it to comment on it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've read some of the news coverage of this. I've not been in touch with either the transition team or the auto -- Ford about their announcement, but I read in published reports about their announcement that it was not tied to any political considerations. And I noted that over the last five years or so that Ford has actually increased the number of workers at their company by about 28,000.\nSo this is only the latest step in a long-running, significant and positive trend for the U.S. economy that those jobs are being protected. So that's obviously good news.\nJon.\nQ: Josh --\nQ: 28,000 domestic?\nMR. EARNEST: We can look up the numbers for you. We'll follow up.\nQ: Josh, on the measures taken against Russia, why was Vladimir Putin not mentioned as one of those sanctions? Is that an indication you didn't have evidence that the Russian leader was responsible for this, or directed this, approved it?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily, Jon. The intelligence community has indicated their view that given the significance of the actions that Russia carried out against the United States, their conclusion is that this is something that had to have been directed at the highest levels of the Russian government.\nQ: So why not hit the President? I mean, he's the guy responsible.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, typically, with regard to sanctions policy, that there are only certain circumstances in which the leader of the country is personally named. I can't get into all the -- there's no denying that this is a significant action. So what I would say is just that it would be rather extraordinary if Mr. Putin himself were among the people who were listed. But I can't speak to the decisions that were made by the experts at the Treasury Department about who was named and who was not.\nQ: So when the Chinese hacked OPM in 2015, 21-plus million current and former government employees and contractors had their personal records stolen by the Chinese. Why did the White House do nothing publicly in reaction to that hack, which, in some ways, was even more widespread than what we saw here from the Russians, allegedly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that what we've seen is that these are two cyber incidents that are malicious in nature, but materially different.\nQ: Twenty-one million people had their personal data taken. Fingerprints, social security numbers, background checks -- I mean, this was a far-reaching hack.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not downplaying the significance of it, I'm just saying that it's different than seeking to interfere in the conduct of a U.S. national election. I can't speak to the steps that have been taken by the United States in response to that Chinese malicious cyber activity.\nQ: But nothing was announced. There was not a single step announced by the White House in response to that.\nMR. EARNEST: That is true that there was no public announcement about our response, but I can't speak to what response may have been initiated in private.\nQ: But no diplomats expelled, no compounds shut down, no sanctions imposed, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I can't speak to --\nQ: You don't do that stuff secretly. I mean, that's --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly when it comes to the diplomats, that's right, there were no diplomats PNGed. That's something that we would announce publicly.\nBut, look, I can't speak to the response because, as you pointed out, that's not something that we have announced. It certainly is something that we take seriously. It certainly -- the President has raised directly with his Chinese counterpart. And we certainly have seen commitments from the Chinese with regard to some norms in cyberspace that we would like to see them observe -- for example, we did see the Chinese President commit in the Rose Garden in the fall of 2015 that Russia -- or that China would not be engaged in the kind of cyber-enabled theft for commercial gain that's sponsored by national governments.\nSo that represents some progress, and that does represent the protection of U.S. commercial interests here in the United States. And that certainly is an important step, an important part of establishing some of these rules of the road that will allow the international community to resolve how to limit the malicious behavior of some actors in cyberspace.\nQ: But do you see how -- that there's just this wildly different response? With the Russians, which, of course, is very politically charged, the White House takes this action, makes it public. With the Chinese, which was not so political charged but was absolutely as far-reaching a hack as we had ever seen in this country, nothing was done publicly.\nMR. EARNEST: At least of the government. At least of the government, right? There are ample examples of other malicious cyber actors in the private sector --\nQ: But in response to that OPM hack --\nMR. EARNEST: -- exploiting personal identifiable information and engaging in other wide-reaching malicious cyber activity.\nBut, look, I'm not suggesting that somehow that's not important. What I'm just saying is that it's materially different than the kind of hack-and-leak strategy that we saw the Russians engage in to try to influence our democracy. That is significant. That's serious. And that explains the serious steps that President Obama has imposed against the Russians in response.\nBut with regard to the Chinese, we have made some progress with them in trying to limit the kind of malicious cyber activity that could threaten U.S. interests either in the United States or around the world, in our government or in the private sector. And we're pleased with some of the progress that we've made. But there is no denying that the next administration will assume a significant burden in trying to craft a policy in cyberspace that effectively stands up to our adversaries and looks out for the interests of the American people.\nQ: Okay. And then just one other quick -- Sean Spicer. I think this is your first briefing since he was announced as the incoming press secretary for President Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: It is.\nQ: Any advice to Sean on how to conduct this job?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I had an opportunity to congratulate Sean via email shortly after the announcement was made. As you all have heard me say on a number of occasions, the opportunity and the honor to stand before this podium and advocate for a set of values and a President that I deeply believe in is extraordinary, and it's the kind of opportunity that I wouldn't trade for anything. I sincerely hope that he finds the same kind of challenge and satisfaction in the job that I have.\nAnd I don't know Sean personally, but I expect to get the chance to meet him soon and to talk to him about this job a little bit.\nIsaac.\nQ: Iwant to bring it back to North Korea for a second. Does the President feel confident in Donald Trump's ability to protect the United States if a nuclear missile is launched by North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Isaac, that hearkens back to some of the rhetoric that was used by both sides in the campaign leading up to the election, and the President expressed some rather profound concerns about the incoming President. But the election is over. And I've done my best to avoid re-litigating those fights.\nI think what I can tell you is that the President has strong confidence in the men and women of the United States military, the men and women of the United States intelligence community, the men and women in the United States State Department who ultimately are responsible for implementing policies that protect the American people, including from the threats that emanate in North Korea.\nSo we're going to be counting on our men and women in the intelligence community to continue to provide decision-makers with the best available intelligence about North Korea's actions. We're going to rely on the Department of Defense and the men and women of the United States military to make more strategic decisions about stationing equipment and antiballistic missile technology to protect the American people. And we're going to be relying on the men and women of the State Department to go and build an international coalition to increase the pressure on the North Korean regime to compel them to pursue a different path.\nAnd those are all institutions and patriots who, every day, set aside politics, set aside their own political leanings, set aside their own preferences about who should be President of the United States, and just focus on the task at hand. And the people in those three communities -- at the State Department, the Defense Department and intelligence community -- all have substantial responsibilities when it comes to protecting the American people. And the President has confidence that those men and women, those American patriots, will continue to do their important work with enormous skill and expertise and patriotism to protect the country.\nQ: But going back to -- as you said, there was a lot of talk about this during the campaign. It's been about two months since he delivered his last campaign speech. In those two months, does he feel more confident in Donald Trump's ability to handle the nuclear situation, both in having the nuclear codes and protecting from a nuclear attack? Less confident? Or is he in the same place that he was the day of the election?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about this, but my assessment would be that his opinions have not changed. But the time and place for presenting those opinions has come and gone, and we're focused now on a transition.\nQ: And just on the WikiLeaks -- Julian Assange did an interview in which he -- with Fox News in which he says that the administration -- first of all, he says that WikiLeaks did not receive its information from a state actor, and, second of all, says that there are essentially holes in the case that the administration has laid out about the role that WikiLeaks had, that WikiLeaks wasn't mentioned in anything that the President or anybody has said about this, and that this means that you guys must not be sure that there is a connection there. What's your response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: My response is that the President has complete confidence in the assessment that's been put forward by the intelligence community, and there's no reason to doubt it.\nQ: And that WikiLeaks received -- that there's no lack of mentioning WikiLeaks for any purpose, or -- what Assange is talking about is that you guys didn't say -- you've connected it to the Russians, but you haven't said, well, then it went to WikiLeaks from the Russians, that that's just semantics, essentially, from Assange?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I didn't see the entirety of his -- I didn't see much of any of his interview, so it's hard for me to respond directly in kind. I think what I can tell you is the President has complete confidence in the assessment that's been put forward by the intelligence community. And there's still work that they're doing on this. And the President has tasked the intelligence community with putting forward more information before January 20th not just about what Russia did in the 2016 election, but about some of the malicious cyber activity that we saw in the context of the 2008 and 2012 elections, as well. And there certainly is the possibility that more evidence that's pertinent to some of those claims could be included. We'll have to wait and see.\nQ: Just last question -- do you have any update on when we should expect the intelligence report that the President has asked for?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on timing at this point, just before January 20th.\nJulianna.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. David Axelrod tweeted -- going back to the House Ethics Office -- David Axelrod tweeted \"This House Ethics drama was an absolute gift to Donald Trump, a big fat zeppelin for him to shoot down, which he did.\" Do you think that this was teed up for the President-elect, who himself has had some issues regarding conflicts of interests and some of his own ethical questions swirling around him leading into his inauguration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't spoken to David today. My guess is he wasn't expressing admiration for a clever strategic move on the part of Republicans to make the President look -- the President-elect look good. I actually think he was making the opposite point, that Republicans in Congress have revealed a lot about their priorities when the first action that they took was to vote in secret to gut some of the ethical requirements that they're subject to. So I think the point that David was making is simply that it's pretty obvious to everybody that that's a really bad idea.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just want to circle back on Jon's question about Russia versus China, and the reaction. Lisa Monaco has previously cited diplomatic inroads with China as part of the reason why the administration has had some success in limiting and reducing cyber activity -- negative cyber activity from the Chinese. And I'm curious why, then, would the administration continue that same process with the Russians to get a similar response, rather than the sort of heavy-handed expelling operatives and shuttering --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think the response to the Chinese action has been different than the response to the Russian action because their actions that both those countries undertook were different. What we saw on the part of the Chinese was concerning with regard to some of the malicious cyber activity that had an impact on the U.S. government. The Russian cyber activity was actually a more specifically directed threat to undermine U.S. democracy.\nSo their tactics were different. Their ultimate goal was different. And that would explain why our response was different. In both cases, we've taken that malicious cyber activity and those breaches quite seriously, but our responses have, as I acknowledge to Jon, have been different.\nQ: Also, on the Ford Motor announcement -- and you may or may not have had a chance to see it, the one where they're saying essentially they're going to not develop this plant over in Mexico. Donald Trump had previously threatened to levy some sort of a tax or, if you will, some sort of tariff on cars that were made there that would come back to the U.S. You were asked earlier if you thought this was a victory for I think maybe Donald Trump, but I'd be curious if you think this is a victory for the American people and American workers in particular, who may now benefit from the fact that there will be more jobs related to this decision than might have been.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, it won't surprise you to hear that the President who has presided over an economy that's created nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs is pleased to hear when another 700 manufacturing jobs have been saved.\nQ: I also want to ask you something the President sort of hinted at -- or maybe not hinted at, maybe he just came right out and said it. (Laughter.) He said, \"Listen, if I were able to run again, I would have beaten Donald Trump.\" Why do you think the President made that point? What was behind his decision to make a comment like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Because his point was -- if you go back and look at the interview, he was making the point that the message that he delivered in his 2008 campaign and in his 2012 campaign is one that deeply resonated with the American people and got him -- allowed him to build a strong coalition all across the country, that allowed him to be elected in 2008 and reelected in 2012 with strong majorities not just of the electoral college, but actually a majority of the voting population.\nAnd President Obama is the first President to be elected and reelected with more than 51 percent of the vote since Eisenhower. And that's an indication of how much strong support there is all across the country for the President's message. And the President believes, after eight years, that he's stayed true to that message, that he's campaigning on the same set of values and on the same set of -- message that appeals to the idea that everybody in America should have an opportunity to succeed and that people shouldn't be --\nQ: -- that message in North Carolina; he was out very forcefully. They saw that message in Michigan; he was out very forcefully. And neither state went for the Democrat in that particular circumstance.\nMR. EARNEST: That's true. But I think what we've found -- and this was true in 2010 and to a lesser extent in 2014, but still in 2014 -- that when the President wasn't on the ballot that he didn't have as much success as he would have liked in making that same argument in support of other candidates. And I think there are a lot of theories as to why that is, but that's undeniably true.\nQ: Would the President like to debate Donald Trump? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: No, he would not.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, the President is going to be -- when it comes to ACA and the contributions it's given to millions of people -- and you've already cited some of the positive points. But because this is so important for the President in the waning days to lean in like this, can you get into the conversations that President Obama has had with Donald Trump in the lead-up to tomorrow? Can you talk to us about what he said about ACA on the phone?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't. I've worked hard to try to protect the ability of the President of the United States to have private conversations with the President-elect. And when some of the fact of those calls has spilled into the public, we've done our best to try to confirm and explain to you the context of those conversations. But for the substance of the calls, I'm going to protect their ability to have those calls in private.\nQ: The President here, the last day before he went on vacation, did say when he talks to Donald Trump, he explains the benefits of some issues. Was he talking about ACA as one of those conversations and the benefits that he was talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't be surprised if the Affordable Care Act was among those.\nQ: So when he says \"benefits,\" does he tout the things that we already know? Or does he go into the weeds about things and talk about more that we -- things that the average person doesn't know and how it works? What makes it work? What would be a problem if it's taken away? What does he say when he talks about the benefits to Donald Trump about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm just not going to get into the context of their -- to the substance of the conversations that they're having.\nQ: The President did allude to that, so he didn't -- he didn't allude to it, he did tell us that from this podium.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Okay. So lastly, with everything going on now, the back-and-forth between the President-elect and the sitting President of the United States in the waning days of this President's presidency, is there a possibility, a strong possibility that there will be a final press conference from President Obama before he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any scheduling announcements at this point, but I wouldn't be surprised if something like that happened. We'll keep you posted.\nQ: Is it to protect -- would it be to protect his legacy more so, or to put a final note to America?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll wait until we have something to announce before we describe why we announced it. (Laughter.)\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. While the President was in Hawaii, it was reported that the Obama administration is -- well, it informed Congress that it could transfer up to 19 prisoners from Guantanamo Bay before the President leaves office. Are you able to confirm those reports?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not in a position to confirm individual notifications to Congress. As you know, Jordan, the statute does require that when the administration is prepared to transfer a detainee from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to another country in the context of security requirements that would limit their ability to pose a threat to the United States, the administration is required to give Congress 30 days' notice before completing that transfer.\nSo this is part of our routine effort that we've undertaken over the last several years to reduce the population of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. But I can't speak to any individual notifications that have been made to Congress or give you a specific preview about potential upcoming transfers. But I think I would expect at this point additional transfers to be announced before January 20th.\nQ: On that note, Donald Trump tweeted today that there should be no further releases from Guantanamo. Is his attitude on that issue going to factor into the administration's decisions at all on transfers in the final day?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it will not. He'll have an opportunity to implement the policy that he believes is most effective when he takes office on January 20th.\nRon.\nQ: On the Russia hacking, you've heard some of the statements from the President-elect that are skeptical of the intelligence assessments. Has there been any conversation between members of this administration and the incoming administration about the skepticism, about the intelligence about Russia being behind this hack?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any specific conversations, but I'm confident in the context of the transition and getting the President-elect's team up to speed on a range of important national security issues that we're currently dealing with here. I'm confident that officials in the administration, including at the White House, have represented to the transition team full confidence in the assessment in conclusions that have been announced by the intelligence community.\nQ: So what do you think of the President-elect's statements that he knows things that others don't know and that he still is not convinced that the Russians are behind this?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm glad that it's somebody else's job to explain exactly what he meant. (Laughter.)\nQ: Because you --\nMR. EARNEST: Because I don't know. So presumably, somebody who has an opportunity to speak to him directly can try to explain to those of us in the public who weren't quite sure what he's referring to.\nQ: But this is a serious thing, though, because this was a matter of national security that --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I --\nQ: -- the sanctions were levied and these diplomats were expelled. This was a big, big deal. How concerned is the President or the administration about the President-elect's attitude that he knows more or something different and that he's still not convinced?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in the context of the campaign we had ample opportunity to --\nQ: This is the real thing -- this is not the campaign.\nMR. EARNEST: The campaign is over, that's right. The campaign is over. And now we are in a position where our responsibility is, as public servants in the Obama administration, to do as much as we possibly can to help the President-elect's team get up to speed and understand the complexity and depth of the range of issues, both domestic and national security, that they're going to be tasked with managing, starting just 16 days from now.\nQ: Bottom line, you can't explain why there's this difference of opinion here in terms of --\nMR. EARNEST: The bottom line, there's a reason that the President-elect has his own spokesperson, and there will be somebody else standing behind this podium when he takes office.\nQ: When you were talking about the review that's underway on cyber issues, I think you said that in terms of proof or evidence that there may or may not be a public release of what we would consider proof or evidence of the claims. Is that true?\nMR. EARNEST: There are a couple of things on this. Isaac was asking me about some of the claims that were apparently made in an interview about how or whether or to what extent WikiLeaks may have been involved in this effort. And I was trying to answer his question by saying that it's possible, though I don't know, but it's possible that additional information that would be helpful in understanding what WikiLeaks's role in all of this could be included in that report. I don't know whether it will be or not.\nQ: But as to the role that the Russians played in the -- the intelligence agencies in Russia and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: That's a definitive conclusion that's been reached -- that was announced, actually, before the election. Some of the information that was included in the Joint Analysis Report that was released by the FBI and DHS last week included technical information about the tactics and technology and software that was used by the Russians to carry out these actions and other actions like them. I think that's -- its technical, but I think it's pretty solid evidence of Russian involvement in this matter.\nQ: So you don't -- the administration doesn't feel a need to present more proof?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The administration feels a responsibility to communicate as directly and as clearly as possible with the American public to help them understand what the U.S. government knows about Russian efforts to undermine our system of government. And we've already done that. We did that before the election, and I would anticipate that that report that the intelligence community is working on would also further that goal.\nQ: And on meetings on Hill about the Affordable Care Act, is that the only issue on the agenda? Or is there anything else that the President wants to communicate to these incoming members of Congress about his concerns, his priorities, his hopes and fears?\nMR. EARNEST: Protecting the Affordable Care Act is the primary topic on the agenda. I wouldn't rule out that other things may come up. And if they do, we'll do our best to give you a readout.\nQ: What else is there? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of -- 17 and a half days or whatever is left -- what else is there that the President is really trying to --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously touched on a couple of them. We talked about the Affordable Care Act, and there isn't just the need to try to protect the Affordable Care Act from being destroyed by Republicans; there's also a need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make it possible for people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act. And we've actually seen people signing people up at a record clip. Despite all this negative publicity and despite some of the uncertainty that Republicans are injecting into this process, we're actually seeing a record number of people signing up for the Affordable Care Act that are at a record rate. So that's a positive step. And we certainly -- that didn't happen by accident. And we certainly want to make sure we're doing what's necessary to facilitate those signups.\nObviously following through on the business with Russia in terms of implementing the steps that were announced last week ad also putting forward this report before January 20th are steps that we're focused on.\nYou can certainly always expect the President to be very focused on the counter-ISIL campaign. And the President will continue to meet with his national security team. I wouldn't be surprised if that's something that members of Congress may be interested in.\nAnd of course, we're focused on a smooth and effective transition. And that means trying to pay attention to all the little details that may not rise to the level of an interaction like this, but are still critical to a seamless handoff of governing responsibility from one administration to the next. And that requires the time and attention of a lot of people inside the administration, including the President of the United States.\nQ: How is all that going?\nMR. EARNEST: So far it's going well.\nQ: We've heard mixed messages about it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've heard mixed messages about this from the other side. But this administration has remained focused on the effective -- facilitating the effective transition that President Obama promised at the beginning of last year. And we've made good on that promise so far.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, now that the new Congress has been convened, does President Obama have any intention of making any nominations or resubmitting any old nominations to the new Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing that I have to preview here. But if we have -- if we're going to re-nominate some people, we'll make sure and let you know publicly that we've done such.\nQ: Should we assume the Garland nomination has now lapsed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President acknowledged at a Hanukkah event that Chief Judge Garland attended last year that President Obama expects Chief Judge Garland to continue to serve the American people with distinction on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe fact that he was not given the opportunity to explain to the Senate and to the American people why he would have served the country honorably and with distinction on the United States Supreme Court is a scar on the reputation of the United States Senate.\nIt is a part of the legacy of Republican leadership in Congress from the last several years. And I don't mean that as a compliment. And I think that for years the United States Senate will be dealing with the fallout of the decision that they made to so egregiously subject Chief Judge Garland to such unfair treatment.\nRepublicans themselves have praised Chief Judge Garland. Republicans have described him a consensus nominee. Republicans have praised his service to this country -- both as a judge but also as a federal prosecutor, and a senior official at the Department of Justice who led the investigation and prosecution of one of the worst terrorists in American history.\nMerrick Garland is a patriot. And he deserved far better treatment than he received from Republicans in the United States Senate. But because he's the bigger man, he's going to continue to serve this country with honor and distinction at the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. And the President is quite proud that he'll do that.\nQ: What do you mean by fallout?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I mean that there will be difficulty in the Senate not just in the Trump presidency, but for future Presidents as they navigate the process of nominating judges to the federal bench.\nWhat sort of credibility do Republicans have in making the case to Democrats that they should fairly consider the nominations of a Republican judge -- of a Republican President? Republican senators blocked an eminently qualified Supreme Court nominee whose qualifications were not in question simply because he was nominated by a Democratic President. How then can Republicans go to Democratic senators and say that they should support nominees put forward by a Republican President? They have no standing in which to do that.\nNow, will Democrats do the right thing and fulfill their constitutional obligations? I think they probably will. But they won't be doing it because Republicans have any semblance of moral high ground or any sort of moral leverage or any moral weight to their claim that that's what Democratic senators should do.\nAnd I think that that breakdown of comity in the United States Senate, that abdication of the basic responsibility of members of the United States by subjecting it to such intense partisanship and actually allowing partisanship to supersede constitutional obligation, it's discouraging. And it's a precedent that I think Republicans will regret setting.\nQ: Also, can you tell us what President Obama's thinking is in going to Chicago next week for the farewell address? I went back and checked. All the farewell addresses back to Eisenhower were delivered here at the White House. Why does President Obama want to go out of town?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama is going to go back to his hometown, go back to the place where he began his career in public service -- a community, a city that was so supportive of him throughout his career in public service.\nAnd there is a unique story to President Obama's public service having started out as a community organizer and somebody whose first job in public service wasn't in politics, per Senate -- at least it didn't involve running for office -- but was actually focused on trying to help people in the economically disadvantaged communities advocate for themselves.\nAnd that commitment to fighting for working people is something that has motivated President Obama from his earliest days as a community organizer to his last days as President of the United States. And so it's a fitting bookend that he would go back to that city where he got his start to make a speech like this.\nQ: Will that be his last out-of-town trip?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I would anticipate that it will be his last out-of-town trip as President of the United States.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Alexis.\nQ: Josh, to follow up on the list that you were giving to Ron, is the President going to -- how would he describe to Democrats that he speaks to this week and also to the beneficiaries of DACA what to expect, what they should plan on, what they should anticipate after the 20th? Because some Democrats have urged the President to act in a unique kind of way before he leaves to extend the benefits or to maintain the benefits of DACA?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any specific announcements that you should expect from the President on this particular issue. Of course, there is a longstanding precedent in the U.S. government for the way that information like this is maintained.\nThere's a commitment that was made to people who came forward to apply for deferred action -- DREAMers. These are individuals who came to the United States as children, were brought to the United States as children and are here through no fault of their own. And the United States is the only country they've ever known. And many of these are young people who have graduated from high school, gone on to college, served on our military, have otherwise shown themselves to be quality additions to the country and to communities across the country.\nAnd so the President's view is that these individuals are American in every way but their papers, and that the limited enforcement resources of the United States' government are better focused on people who are in the United States illegally and have criminal records, or only recently crossed the border. Those are the kinds of people that are worthy of aggressive enforcement action.\nAnd that is exactly the kind of policy that this administration has pursued. It's made our country safer. It's made our country fairer. And I know at least at one point, the President-elect indicated that he thought that was a pretty smart approach.\nBut when it comes to what he will do after January 20th, even the current President of the United States is not sure exactly what the incoming President may decide to do.\nQ: The other thing I wanted to ask you is a small detail for January 20th. So is there any change to the normal protocol or customary protocol where we expect the President-elect, the Vice President-elect to come for coffee at the White House and to ride together with the outgoing President to the swearing-in?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the schedule for January 20th. But obviously as that date gets closer, we'll be able to walk you through all the minute details of that day that symbolize the kind of peaceful transition, the peaceful transfer of power that is a hallmark of American democracy and it critical to the strength and success of our country.\nQ: But you can't confirm today that President Obama and Mrs. Obama extend an invitation to the Trumps to come for coffee before they go up to the swearing-in?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I would expect that as we have over the last couple of months, we will observe the kinds of traditions and steps that have ensured a smooth and effective transition. That's what we've been doing for the last two months. I would expect that continue on the last day.\nBut when it comes to the actual details of the schedule, we'll have more to say about that as the day gets closer.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On Ford, you had said that it didn't seem like there were any political considerations for the decision that was made today, or at least that you hadn't seen anything --\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I said is that Ford had indicated that their decision was not affected by politics.\nQ: Okay, sure. But the CEO of Ford did say that he was encouraged by the pro-growth policies of President-elect Trump and the new Congress. And that certainly sounds like it's a political consideration or at least a calculation that it would be better to build more cars in the United States under the incoming President than under the current President.\nMR. EARNEST: My guess is you should ask that question to the Ford CEO. But I don't think that he would want his comments to be interpreted that way. But you should ask somebody who has spoken to him.\nQ: A couple more on a different subject.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: You seemed a little bit feistier today in response to some of the things that the President-elect has said, or else you're just happy to see us --\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe it's because I shaved that holiday beard this morning, so I'm feeling a little --\nQ: That's possibly could be it. (Laughter.) And again, perhaps it's just you're happy to be back here. But it does seem like during the two-week break between when we were last here and now, that the dйtente between the old administration and the new administration has somehow been broken. You had President-elect Trump talking about roadblocks that this administration was putting out, and you directly challenging him today when it comes to ethics, when it comes to Ford with trade, that sort of thing. Is there a reason for that? Is it that the clock is ticking down on the administration? Do you not see it that way?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't see it that way. I think that -- what I have done since the day after the election when I stood at this podium for almost two hours answering your questions is I've made clear that the vigorous, deeply held, passionate differences of opinion that we have on a range of issues from policy to basic American values, there are differences. And they're profound. But there's also a profound responsibility that all of us who serve in this administration, including the President, has to ensure a smooth and effective transition.\nThat doesn't mean that we're prepared to go along with everything that the incoming administration says, but it certainly does mean that we have a responsibility to give the incoming President every opportunity to get a running start on the job.\nAnd that's something that President Obama has taken to heart in his Oval Office meeting and the handful of conversations that they've had on the telephone since then. And there have been a number of meetings all across the federal government that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to ensuring a smooth and effective transition.\nIt doesn't mean those differences went away. And the fact that those differences exist don't mean that the transition has hit a rough spot. It means that these are deeply held views of the Obama administration, and they differ sharply with the President-elect.\nBut the President-elect campaigned on doing things differently. He campaigned on taking a different approach, and he won an election against a candidate who was pursuing a strategy that was more similar to what President Obama has pursued. Now, the President-elect didn't get more votes, but he did win the election. And since day one, this administration has been focused on ensuring a smooth and effective transition. And we've made good on that promise.\nAnd the fact that we have differences of opinion is not evidence that the transition is breaking down. It's evidence that we've got well-known differences, but we're not letting them get in the way of a smooth and effective transition.\nQ: And on that note, could you tell us a little bit more about the tone that the President will take in that speech next week, what some of the themes maybe he'd hit upon would be, and whether or not his family will go with him on that trip?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll have more on the speech before the end of this week. I know that the speech is still going through some drafts. Rather than preview it now, let me get it a little bit farther down the process of being written. But I'll come back to you with something before the end of the week.\nQ: How many drafts?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll keep you posted.\nGeorge.\nQ: I've got to ask you a quick follow on your nostalgic journey back to Decorah.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: What happened to those two young organizers? Did they end up in the Cabinet? Ambassadors? How did you reward them? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I know one of them worked at the White House. And I'm not sure what happened to the other one.\nQ: You didn't reward the other one. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Both of them have gone on to do quite well, I'm sure. But there are at least a couple of other people that I first met in that Iowa, Des Moines -- at Des Moines, Iowa campaign headquarters that are still working at the White House today. So I'm not the only one who is still around.\nChris, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Great. Over the weekend, Judge Reed O'Connor issued a nationwide injunction against the Obama administration interpretation of the Affordable Care Act to prohibit discrimination against transgender people and women who have had abortions. Does it make sense for the administration to fight that decision in the 17 days that remain before Trump takes office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice for the legal strategy that we'll pursue. But obviously the administration believes deeply that all Americans regardless of their sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation should have access to quality affordable health care free from any sort of discrimination. That's not just a principle and a value that the administration believes strongly in. I'm confident that the vast majority of Americans believe strongly in that principle, as well.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:35 P.M.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120992", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:43 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any comments at the start, so we can go straight to your questions. Darlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Yeah, thanks. Would you give us a brief oral readout of the President's meeting on the Hill today with congressional members?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd be happy to.\nQ: He was there for more than 90 minutes, so he must have had a lot to say.\nMR. EARNEST: He did have a lot to say. And you've heard a little bit about his comments from some of the Democratic leaders who attended the meeting.\nThe President began his remarks by expressing his gratitude and pride for all of the progress that's been made over the last eight years. And that gratitude was rooted not just in the political success that Democrats have had in advancing that agenda, but rooted in the tangible positive difference that their efforts have made in the lives of millions of Americans in communities large and small across the country. And much of that work would not have been possible had the President not been able to work effectively with Democrats in Congress to get so much of that done, given the unreasonable and unprecedented obstruction that was erected by congressional Republicans.\nThe President continued saying that that should fuel their efforts moving forward. And even though Democrats in Congress will not have the kind of cooperative partner that they've enjoyed for the last eight years in the White House, they still have a set of values and priorities that are worth fighting for. And the good news is that those are values and priorities that most Americans agree with and strongly support, and those are values and priorities that lead to policies that make people's lives better and make our country stronger. And the President expressed his -- the word that he used was \"envy\" for the opportunity that they have to keep up that fight.\nAnd the President expressed his confidence in their ability not just to wage those fights with passion, but he expressed confidence in their ability to succeed -- again, both because the majority of the American people agree with them, whether it's investing in the kinds of policies that expand economic opportunity for middle-class families, whether it is expanding access to health care for every American making it not just a privilege but a right, making sure that there are consumer protections in place so that every American can't be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, and they can't be subject to lifetime caps that allow them to no longer benefit from insurance coverage if someone in their family gets sick. These are the kinds of values and priorities that Democrats have long fought for, and these are the values and priorities that most Americans agree with.\nSo that was essentially the President's opening statement, and then he took questions from a substantial number of House and Senate Democrats. And most of the questions centered on the proximate fight on Capitol Hill, which is the Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but the President had an opportunity to touch on some other areas, as well. And the President really enjoyed the opportunity to go up there, and was warmly received, which he has been every time by Democrats on Capitol Hill, even when he's gone up there to address differences that they have.\nBut I got to tell you, in this case the President has gone to -- in the past, and you all have covered times when the President has traveled to Capitol Hill to try to bridge differences with Democrats on Capitol Hill -- that was not the case this time. This time the President was there to affirm his support for the agenda that Democrats in Congress are fighting for. And that unanimity will be a source of strength for Democrats in the years ahead. And the President encouraged them to draw on it as they continue to fight for the values that they've been fighting for not just the last eight years, but for most of the people in the room they've been fighting for for their entire career in public service.\nQ: And you mentioned other areas. What other issues did they talk about besides health care?\nMR. EARNEST: There were a range of legislative issues that I think you would expect -- criminal justice reform, immigration reform, infrastructure -- some of the other issues that Democrats are likely to be working on over the next couple of years.\nQ: To go back to the question of what he wants Democrats to do when it comes to health care, once the law is repealed, would he like Democrats to negotiate with Republicans to come up with a replacement? Or would he like them to refuse to negotiate and just leave Republicans to be the ones to come up with a replacement on their own, since they didn't vote for it in the first place and they're the ones that are anxious to repeal it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start out by answering your question by making a little news and saying that I agree with Congressman Rand Paul -- or Senator Rand Paul -- I just gave him a demotion -- Senator Rand Paul on something. Senator Rand Paul wrote an op-ed in which he indicated that the people who repeal the Affordable Care Act are going to assume the blame for the chaos that ensues. That's true. And that's not a direct quote from his op-ed, but I think that is a faithful representation of what he wrote.\nAnd I do think that's an illustration of something you've heard the President talk about quite a bit since November 9th, which is that there's a difference between delivering a poll-tested, sound bite-packaged promise on the campaign trail, and actually delivering on that promise once you assume the responsibility to govern the greatest country in the world. And there is no better example than the Republicans who -- and I'm not just talking about the President-elect here, I'm talking about Republicans in states all across the country who have spent years excoriating the Affordable Care Act and vowing to do everything that they possibly can to repeal it.\nThe time has now come for them to consider how they're going to make good on that promise. Republicans are in charge of the House of Representatives. Republicans are in charge of the United States Senate. And starting on January 20th, Republicans will be in charge of the White House. And they're going to have to decide how to make good on that promise to repeal and replace. The challenge is, is that there are a lot of people in the great state -- the Commonwealth of Kentucky who are strong supporters of Senator Rand Paul, whose livelihood and, in some cases, life depends on the health care they receive from Obamacare, whether that's expanded Medicaid or insurance that they've purchased in the marketplace run by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\nSo you could understand why Rand Paul would have some anxiety about this plan -- about this strategy that's put forward by Republicans, and the anxiety is palpable. One of the most articulate Republicans on Capitol Hill is the Speaker of the House, and he did a news conference today where he was unable to explain why Republicans have not put forward their replacement plan. He's a smart guy, he's spent years thinking about this. He's smart when it comes to politics, he's smart when it comes to policy. We've got profound differences and he's got a different point of view, but there's nobody that questions his intellect. And even he can't articulate exactly why they aren't putting forward a replacement plan. That does not bode well for Republicans making good on this promise. But we'll see.\nOne other reason, and this is something that the President did discuss with Democrats on Capitol Hill, and one of the reasons that this is particularly hard for Republicans, including Republicans who represent states like West Virginia and Kentucky, Tennessee -- not typically states that you consider as bastions of Obama supporters -- but these are states that have many communities that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic. Expanded Medicaid and health insurance that people purchase through Obamacare marketplaces offer support and service and treatment to people who are being ravaged -- or to people who are addicted to opioids and are trying to beat that addiction.\nAnd we know that this is an issue that Republicans care about. Republicans, at the end of last year, were bragging about a piece of government spending that they had passed to increase support for treatment for people who are fighting opioid addiction. The worst way to fight the opioid crisis is to strip away health care from millions of Americans who rely on it.\nA similar argument could be made about cancer research. That was also included in the package that Republicans were bragging about passing at the end of last year. What good is it to invest billions of dollars in cancer research if you're going to prevent millions of Americans from being able to get a check-up once a year? We don't need to do a bunch of intensive academic research in cancer to understand what kinds of screenings are important and how important those screenings are, particularly for people of a certain age, a certain demographic, and a certain medical condition.\nSo these are the kinds of complexities that Republicans are now responsible for because they're responsible for governing a country of 300 million people.\nAnd so to go back to your more direct question -- and I think this is the other element of the answer that the President offered to Democrats -- is something that you've heard him say before -- in fact, since the day that he signed the Affordable Care Act into law -- which is the President believes that the country would benefit from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill actually having a conversation about ideas for strengthening and improving the Affordable Care Act.\nThe President has never made the argument that the Affordable Care Act is perfect. It's done a whole lot of good for people, it saved lives, but it could be improved. But that's never the offer that Republicans have put forward. Democrats have put it forward. The President himself has put forward ideas for how to strengthen and improve the program, but there's never been a willingness on the part of Republicans to do that.\nIf Republicans changed their tune, recognizing these complexities, and say, all right, Democrats, we acknowledge that tearing this thing down is not going to be good for the country and is a little more politically complicated than we anticipated, but you guys got to admit that there are some things that we can do to improve this proposal, that's a conversation of an entire different color. And that is a conversation that the President encouraged Democrats to consider engaging Republicans on, but that would require a different approach on the part of Republicans, but it's a change in approach that President Obama would welcome.\nYou'd have to talk to Democrats on Capitol Hill what their reaction to that would be. I suspect they would say it depends, but I think even if they say it depends, that does indicate that they're open to it.\nAyesha.\nQ: You talked about the -- going back to the health care meeting -- you talked about the importance of Democrats sticking together. At least one Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin, didn't attend the meeting. He felt like -- although he also criticized Vice President-elect Pence for having his meeting, but he did say that to have President Obama come that it was kind of like a poison pill that is going to hurt bipartisanship. I mean, at this point, is there any consideration that having the President come out so forcefully saying that Democrats need to do this or do that regarding health care, that it does make this a more partisan issue?\nAnd then also, when you're talking about strategies, if the Republicans are unwilling to work with the Democrats, what exactly does the President envision them doing? Should they take some of the Republican tactics and begin -- I don't know if it would be possible -- like shutting down government or doing things like that to get these issues -- to stop the repeal of Obamacare? Like what specifically can they do if Republicans don't want to work with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Ayesha, I think a presidential critic would have to engage in remarkable rhetorical contortions to try to make the case that the President is the one who had made health care a partisan issue. When you consider that the President hosted a meeting at the Blair House with Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress trying to get them to come together around some basic principles of health care reform, when you consider that the essence of the Affordable Care Act was cooked up by the Heritage Foundation and implemented successfully by a Republican governor in Massachusetts who, oh, by the way, happened to be the Republican nominee for President in 2012 -- that's been the approach that the President has taken.\nRepublicans have voted 50 times strictly along party lines to try to repeal the bill. So I think it's hard for anybody to suggest -- seriously, at least -- that somehow the President has made this a partisan issue. In fact, I just indicated the President is continuing not just willingness but desire to see Democrats and Republicans come together around some ideas to strengthen the bill.\nWith regard to Democratic unity, I can't speak to Senator Manchin's schedule, but I've heard him speak about why repealing Obamacare would be a terrible idea for hundreds of thousands of people in the state that he represents in the United States Senate. He agrees with the President and the Democrats in Congress, and is showing the same kind of concern that even people like Rand Paul are showing about the impact of repealing the bill.\nSo, again, you'll have to ask -- I guess I would say it this way: I would welcome the standard of Democratic unity being whether or not Senator Manchin agrees about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I think that he would say what the President has said, which is that it can be improved, Democrats and Republicans should work together to improve it, but the idea of repealing it would be bad for the state and would have bad consequences for people all across the country.\nQ: And when it comes to specific strategies, would the President support Democrats kind of shutting things down, or like what type of specific strategies could they take on if the Republicans don't --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President acknowledged in his meeting with the legislators that he's not the one who is the expert in legislative mechanics, so he didn't have any specific tactical advice for Democrats up there. But the President believes that these are principles that are worth fighting for; that health care is not a privilege -- access to quality, affordable health care is not a privilege, it's a right; that the policies that limit the growth in health care costs for workers, for families, for business owners, and for the United States government is a good thing and something that should be protected; that people shouldn't be discriminated against because they have preexisting conditions; that women shouldn't be charged more by the insurance company just because they're women; people shouldn't have to worry about having to declare bankruptcy just because somebody in their family gets sick.\nThose are principles that are worth fighting for. And there were a lot of nodding heads when the President made that point.\nMichelle.\nQ: You were asked about should Democrats work with Republicans, and you mentioned it would require a different tactic. So are you saying that if the tactic remains repeal, then Democrats should not work on negotiating that?\nMR. EARNEST: Repealing the Affordable Care Act would have devastating consequences for people all across the country, and it's not something that Democrats support, nor should they. And we're seeing that a lot of Republicans are queasy about supporting it -- and they should be -- because of the obvious, tangible, direct consequences that that will have on the lives of millions of people across the country. Twenty-two million people are going to lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. It's going to rip a hole in the deficit -- in the federal budget, and the deficit will go up if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. That's not just my conclusion. You can ask the CBO about that.\nThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act strengthened the Medicare trust fund and extended the life of the trust fund by 11 years. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would roll back that progress. And we've seen, since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the slowest growth in health care costs in our nation's history.\nIf Republicans want to go back to a day in which health care costs for everybody are skyrocketing, they can do that, but that's going to be bad for the economy and will create the kind of chaos that the American people will hold them accountable for.\nQ: You talked about Democrats, that they'd be willing to work with Republicans to improve Obamacare, but only if it's not repealed. Is that right? Is that what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Repealing the Affordable Care Act is not an improvement. Looking for ways to design an increase in subsidies so that working families can get even more affordable access to health care that's available for purchase in the marketplace -- the President thinks that's a pretty good idea. And that is -- subsidies is another word for tax cuts. Ordinarily, you would think that would be something that Republicans would be able to support -- and not just able to support, enthused about supporting.\nBut that's not the reaction that we've seen from them. That's just one idea that the President has put forward, but it's the kind of idea that's rooted in trying to find compromise that the President has been committed to since the day that he signed the Affordable Care Act into law.\nQ: And you talked about Republican promises to repeal it, and now they're going to be -- they're going to have to be accountable for what comes next. Today, Steve Scalise said that the President himself made promises that if you like your health care, you can keep it, and that he should actually be apologizing. What's your response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: My response is simply that the President's record on the Affordable Care Act speaks for itself. And when the President-elect put forward his nominee to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Tom Price, I predicted that at some point in his tenure as the Secretary of Health and Human Services he will stand at this podium and be putting forward a plan that he believes is the right one for the country. And I said at the time that it should be measured against the progress that President Obama has made in reforming our health care system. And I feel strongly about that.\nAnd whether that's expanding access for health care so that 20 million Americans have access to health care, reducing the uninsured rate in this country to all-time lows, limiting the growth in health care costs, preventing people from being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, preventing people from having to declare bankruptcy because somebody in their family gets sick, preventing women from being charged more for their health insurance by their insurance company just because they get sick, extending the life of the Medicare trust fund, reducing the deficit by $3 trillion over 20 years -- that's the standard that President Obama has set. That is the way that the American people can and should judge the President's record when it comes to health care reform. And it's a record that the President is enormously proud of, not just because of the politics, but because of the impact that it's had on the lives of millions of people all across the country.\nThat's what he came into office promising to do. That's what he campaigned on nine years ago in 2008 when he was crisscrossing the country, was taking on the kinds of tough challenges that Washington had been ignoring for too long. And Democratic and Republican Presidents for 100 years had tried, or at least considered trying to take on the notion of health care reform. President Obama took it on and succeeded in getting it done, and he's enormously proud of that.\nQ: He apparently did talk about some tactics, at least generally, saying that Democrats should adopt some of the things that the Tea Party did in opposing Obamacare and they should go out to town halls and things like that. Can you expand on that? I mean, what do you think that would accomplish? And does the President intend to keep working on this, even after he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was making the point that Democrats need to place a priority on telling the story of people who benefitted from the law. And there are lots of those stories to tell -- not just the 20 million Americans who got health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act that didn't have it before, but the millions more Americans who are not being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, who are able to keep their child on their health insurance until age 26, who are not being charged more from their insurance company just because they're a woman. These are the kinds of stories that we can tell. Certainly the expansion of Medicaid has saved countless lives across the country. And the President does believe that it would be an effective tactic, as this debate is waged inside the halls of Congress, to communicate with the American public about the stakes of this debate.\nAnd the President feels strongly that this is a debate that Democrats can win because of the impact that repealing the law, as Republicans are vowing to do, would have on the lives of people in communities all across the country. And that is something that shouldn't just steel the spine of Democratic members of Congress; it's going to -- as I think is evident from Senator Paul's op-ed, it's going leave a lot of Republicans quite uneasy.\nQ: So are we going to keep hearing from President Obama on this after he leaves?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President has been clear about his post-White House plans. He's going to take a vacation, and he expects to be in a position that he can observe and follow the tradition that previous Presidents have shown, which is the country deserves an incoming President with an opportunity to go and lead the country in the direction that he believes is right, and this is a debate that will continue. And the President also feels strongly that he's been on the national stage for more than eight years if you consider his national campaign to win the Oval Office. It's time for the fresh blood. It's time for the next generation of Democrats, and even some Republicans who share his values, to speak up and speak out. It's time for them to get the spotlight. It's time for them to have an opportunity to make that argument. And the President believes that's important for the country. It also ends up being important for the Democratic Party in terms of making sure that the next generation of Democrats is ready to take up the mantle.\nJordan.\nQ: I just want to follow up on that, because Congressman Cummings told a group of reporters after the meeting that the President made it \"very clear that as a citizen he's going to lend his voice to this fight.\" So that seems to contradict a little bit what you said. So where's the gulf there? And does he in some ways plan to speak out about this health care issue after he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President made clear his solidarity with congressional Democrats, and there's no doubt about that among anybody in the room. But, yes, being a citizen is different than being the President of the United States or being an elected member of Congress. And being a former President does necessarily give you a larger platform, but the President is hopeful that he'll be able to observe the kinds of standards that previous Presidents have in giving the next President the opportunity to succeed.\nBut look, the President has been pretty blunt about his approach here. He's talked a lot, even while in office, about how important the office of citizen is both in terms of educating yourself about the issues and engaging in a democratic process. The President will certainly do that. And the President will be interested in supporting Democrats in Congress. He stands with them in solidarity. But there are some limits to what former Presidents typically do once they leave office.\nJulianna.\nQ: Thanks. Just to clarify on that, it sounds like on the one hand you're saying he's resigned to sitting on the sidelines and watching Republicans dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and the same time there's the community organizer in him that would be trying to lend a hand to the effort to salvage elements of the law. So where does that exactly leave him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, \"resigned\" is not at all the word that I would use. I think it was evident from the Democrats in the room that the President feels quite passionate about all of these issues. And the President is confident that the kind of argument that Democrats can put forward is a winning one. So the President continues to be very confident, particularly on this issue of the Affordable Care Act, in the ability of Democrats to make the kind of argument that's going to resonate deeply with the American people. And there's already some evidence that Republicans are uneasy about this, both as -- and so the two pieces of evidence that I cited today are the op-ed from Senator Paul and the inability of one of the most articulate Republicans on Capitol Hill to explain why Republicans don't have their own replacement plan to put forward, even though he's the guy who's responsible for putting that plan forward. So I think that is an indication that Republicans are already starting to reckon with the challenge of keeping this promise.\nAt the same time, the President acknowledges that he's leaving the national stage. That's what the Constitution requires. That's certainly consistent with his wife's preferences. And it's going to be time for somebody else to pick up the mantle. Does that mean that the President is any less committed to these issues than he was before? Of course not. But it does mean that the President expects to be in a position that he can observe the kinds of customs and courtesy, frankly, that was afforded to him by his predecessor.\nNow, the President has also been clear, and the President did discuss this in the meeting as well, that he's hopeful that this won't happen. But if there are basic, fundamental American values that are undermined by a specific policy proposal, then he may feel the need to speak out. But it is his hope, and I would say even his expectation, that that's not something that he will have to do.\nAnd I think the other thing I want to point out here -- and I think this is relevant to the entire context -- what I'm trying to lay out and describe to you is the President's plans for the first year or two that he's out of office. And President Obama is obviously leaving this office at a young age -- he's just 55 -- and I think that there's -- he still has a lot of ambition and a lot more that he would like to do. Most of it he hopes he will be able to do behind the scenes in terms of continuing to stay true to his roots as a community organizer, and motivating and inspiring and even offering training to people who feel called in a similar direction. He wants to make sure that public servants, or people who aspire to public office are people who can get trained in the fundamentals of community organizing. He wants to make sure that young people around the world are exposed to the kinds of values and principles and norms and customs and traditions of the United States when it comes to democracy and citizen engagement and respect for all people, and even entrepreneurship. These are things that the President has talked about as a President and something that he hopes to continue in his post-presidency.\nSo I don't want to leave you with the impression that there's still not a lot of important work for former President Obama to be engaged in -- there is. He recognizes that. And he's got a long to-do list. But that is different than being engaged in the same back-and-forth that he's responsible for engaging in as President.\nQ: So you're saying he has not closed the door to, let's say, over the next six months to a year, if he sees the direction of the Affordable Care Act, or whatever it would be replaced with, moving in a way that he is not comfortable with, that you said he feels like it doesn't hold up to certain American values, that he would lend his voice in some way or another to that debate?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President's hope and expectation is that he will be able to allow others to take up this mantle -- with his strong support -- to carry this fight, and to do so publicly and engage in the back-and-forth. And that's the expectation that he has and that's what he intends to pursue.\nAnd I think that is the best description of his plans. And, yes, I acknowledge that that stops short of entirely ruling out any sort of contingency that may prompt him to speak out publicly. And I'm being intentional about that. But I want to be clear that the President does not envision routine, regular engagement on these issues publicly. That's the responsibility of Democrats in Congress; it's the responsibility of the next generation of Democrats. And, look, it's a remarkable opportunity.\nSo I go back to the way the President began his remarks to Democrats today. They're on the playing field fighting for the issues and priorities and values that this party and this country has long stood for. And there's nobility in that. And he admires those who are willing to do it. He is extraordinarily proud of the way that they are choosing to fight for those values and those priorities, and he will stand with them as they do it. But ultimately it's a fight that they will lead.\nRon.\nQ: Specifically, the Republicans talk about the soaring premiums and triple-digit increases in places, and high deductibles that make the policies in some cases somewhat useless because of these costs. Now, I think your argument has been that subsidies and tax credits sort of illuminate that argument. What's the truth here as far as you're concerned? Because again, there have been premium increases. There are high deductibles. And the other one they argue about is choice being limited. So what are your numbers about premiums and deductibles specifically?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, this is the kind of debate that we welcome and one that I think leaves Republicans uneasy, because -- and let me explain to you why. When we're talking about premium increases, it's important to note that the vast majority of Americans get their health insurance through their employer, and premium increases --\nQ: Right. 3.8 percent or something.\nMR. EARNEST: Just 3.4 percent.\nQ: Sorry.\nMR. EARNEST: That's okay, I've got the numbers in front of me; I've got an advantage. So it's important that the vast majority of Americans have benefitted from the law because we know that the Affordable Care Act has had a positive impact in keeping the growth in those health care costs low for the vast majority of Americans.\nSo there is a smaller group of Americans that doesn't get health insurance through their employer. And before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, these were people who didn't have access to health care, or the only health care they had access to was health care that was riddled with loopholes that didn't actually provide the kind of protections the insurance companies promised. So what the Affordable Care Act did is it essentially established a marketplace and said this is the benchmark for policies that can be sold publicly. So people had access to quality health care.\nNow, the question is you've got that benchmark and so there's quality health care that's available for people who don't get health insurance through their employer -- how do we make it affordable. And the way that we make it affordable through the Affordable Care Act -- the aptly named Affordable Care Act -- is that more than 70 percent of the people who go shopping at that marketplace of quality plans will get assistance, subsidies, from the federal government that will allow them to purchase those plans for less than $100 a month.\nThat's a good deal. That's about the cost of a cellphone. It's not free, but it's a good deal. And it does give them access to health care that they didn't previously have.\nThe question is, for the three in ten, or less than three in ten Americans who don't get health insurance through their employer -- so this is a minority of the minority -- there has been a lot of volatility in some markets with health insurance. And so the question is, what do we do for those people? The President has put forward some ideas. One of the ideas that he's put forward is to expand subsidies and make it easier for more people to get access to subsidies, or higher subsidies, so that more people can get access to that affordable health insurance.\nAnother idea that the President had put forward is --\nQ: But that essentially raises the numbers, right? The government cost raises -- does it not?\nMR. EARNEST: It potentially could, but we'd be happy to --\nQ: And that's the argument against this, that it's more government involvement, that it costs more.\nMR. EARNEST: More government involvement only to the extent that it is providing tax credits to Americans to make it easier for them to choose which health insurance they would like to buy. So I don't buy the argument that it is more government involvement. I do understand the argument that it is more government spending. But it's a paltry increase when you consider that over the next two decades the Affordable Care Act is going to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion. So the increase in subsidies and the cost of doing so is a drop in the bucket when you consider the long-term deficit decrease associated with the Affordable Care Act.\nQ: So why, if you take yourself away from this for a minute -- not too far away but -- (laughter) --\nMR. EARNEST: Sometimes I would like to. (Laughter.)\nQ: You will soon. And you just said something about how the President feels very confident that they have an argument that will resonate with the American people. Well, it didn't in the election clearly. And you would say that this was, in many ways, the defining and animating issue for the Republicans -- repeal. How does the President explain that, this distance?\nMR. EARNEST: Because there is a difference between campaigning and governing.\nQ: No, no, no, I get that --\nMR. EARNEST: Right? So it is easy to go and stand on the campaign trail and make a bunch of promises about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. It's another thing altogether to come into office and be responsible for the 22 million people who will lose health insurance if you do that.\nQ: So you're saying it's just a failure of messaging? This is the Democrats' and the President's, perhaps, failure to show up every place, as he says, and go to Iowa a hundred times and all? I mean, is that -- because you still argue on the merits. You think if you look at the numbers that this argument about premium increases and deductible increases, it's just not there, it's just not true.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the argument is, simply, that Republicans are the ones who now bear the burden of explaining how the American people are going to benefit from their ideas. And yes, Democrats have shown how difficult that is. But we've been willing to pay that political price to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans across the country, and we've got a good argument to make because we're right on the merits.\nSo not only does the complexity make it harder for Republicans to actually explain what impact their policies would have. There's also the rather inconvenient fact that the Republicans ideas are actually bad for people. They're bad for the economy. They're bad for small businesses who are trying to pay for insurance for their employees. They're bad for people who have to purchase their insurance through the market. They're bad for people who have to purchase their insurance, or get their insurance through their employer. They're bad for the U.S. government that will see the deficit skyrocket if Republicans follow through on their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\nSo as complicated as it's been for Democrats to make a compelling case about the positive impact of our plan, it's going to be even more complicated for Republicans, not just because they have to delve into the complexity, but because they have bad ideas. And trying to convince people, in the space of that complexity, that their bad ideas are actually good is going to make it even harder for them. And when you consider how wrapped around the axle they are on day one of the new Congress, I think that would explain some of the President's confidence.\nSteven.\nQ: Josh, since you've been to the podium, the Senate has passed the budget resolution. Senator Paul voted against it, but there were 51 votes --\nMR. EARNEST: Boy, that is a pretty narrow margin, isn't it?\nQ: So what do you make of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, well, I make of that -- well, first of all, the bill they passed today, this suggestion to instruct Congress -- you know the lingo better than I do; I haven't worked on Capitol Hill. But essentially, this is the first step in that process.\nThe actual vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act is one that's coming. And I anticipate a vigorous debate between now and then, particularly when you consider that when -- some of colleagues here in the White House have had a little more experience working on Senate campaigns than I do -- but it sounds like 51 Republican senators may have cast the deciding vote to take away health care from 22 million Americans. They may have cast the deciding vote to blow a hole in the deficit. They may have cast a deciding vote to shorten the lifespan of Medicare and to weaken it by a decade or more. They may have cast the deciding vote to take away protections that prevent people from being discriminated against because they have preexisting conditions. You see where I'm going here.\nAnd Senator Rand Paul looks like he's eager to avoid being on receiving end of those critiques. And he's not a particularly vulnerable incumbent -- at least yet. We'll see. Thank you for the opportunity to answer the question.\nJennifer. Nice to see you. Welcome to the White House.\nQ: Thanks. So Julian Assange from WikiLeaks -- what's the administration's current assessment on him? Should he be considered as credible or should he be considered a criminal or a fugitive. What's the assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: The assessment I think that I can share is the assessment that was put forward by the intelligence community -- all 17 agencies of the intelligence community -- on October 7th, 2016. And it said in part this -- I'm just going to directly quote from them: \"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks, and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona, are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\nMr. Assange, of course, is famously in charge of WikiLeaks. So I think that's a pretty definitive statement from the 17 different agencies of the United States government that deal in intelligence. And this is an assessment that they put out back in October before the election.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I wanted to ask you a question, basically a follow-up on the retweet done by the U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard Verma. In the retweet, he has tweeted a two-and-a-half minute video of three (inaudible) in Mumbai, and (inaudible) offering the job of a class teacher to President Obama after he retires on January 20th. Has the President seen it? Is he planning to take up that offer?\nMR. EARNEST: Lalit, I have to admit I have not seen the retweet, but why don't we take a look at it and we'll get back to you with an answer, okay?\nQ: And when the President hands over his mantle to Trump on January 20th, what are the things he would like Mr. Trump to do when he becomes the President on the front of India-U.S. relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has -- President Obama has invested deeply in strengthening the relationship between the United States and the world's largest democracy in India. And the President believes that there are profound national security, diplomatic and economic benefits for strengthening those ties. So I haven't heard the incoming President articulate what ideas he has for the relationship between the United States and India, but President Obama has certainly found that relationship one that's worth investing in. And he certainly is optimistic about the ability to strengthen the United States economically and to enhance our influence around the globe by strengthening our relationship with India.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Following the Senate vote there, on the Donald Trump tweet about the delay in the intel briefing until Friday, is that an accurate description of how --\nMR. EARNEST: It's not.\nQ: Can you sort of explain that process, and I don't know if you can explain why he said what he said.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't. And fortunately, that's not my job. What I can tell you is that the intelligence community has been working at the direction of the President to put together a report that reflects their consensus view about malicious cyber activity in the context of the 2016, 2012, and 2008 presidential elections. This is only a month or so ago that the President directed the intelligence community to work on this report, and he asked them to produce this report before he leaves office on January 20th. I can tell you that the intelligence community will make good on meeting that deadline with some time to spare. And based on what I've been told by the intelligence community, they have not encountered any delays in producing that report.\nOne of the other notable things is that the President didn't just -- in addition to directing them to compile the report, the President directed the intelligence community to both brief the contents of the report to relevant members of Congress on Capitol Hill and to the President-elect and his team to make sure that they understood exactly how serious this is. So that's something that the President directed the intelligence community to do, and I'm confident that they'll make good on that promise as well.\nI think the real question that looms is a question that's been raised by some of the public comments or tweets from the President-elect, which is just simply, who are you going to believe? On the one hand, you've got the Russians and the aforementioned Mr. Assange. On the other side, you've got the 17 intelligence agencies of the United States government, outside cyber experts that have taken a look at this situation, you've got Democrats on Capitol Hill, you've got Republicans on Capitol Hill, and at least one adviser to Mr. Trump expressing concern about Russia's malicious activity in cyberspace in the context of the election.\nSo there's a pretty stark line that's been drawn, and the President-elect will have to determine who he's going to believe. And the decision that he makes about that I think will have long-term consequences for the way he chooses to govern the country.\nQ: How confident are you that that report will make its way to the hands of lawmakers before the end of this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a timeframe to set on it, but I can tell you -- I can confirm that the intelligence community will meet their deadline of January 20th with ample time to spare.\nQ: Is it fair to say that the President's trip to the Hill today was also, in part, to preserve and protect his legacy, not just the Affordable Care Act but also to encourage Democrats to fight for the many pieces of legislation, executive orders -- to really uphold his vision and their vision, presumably, moving forward? Is it fair to characterize his trip to the Hill in that way?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the way that I would characterize the President's trip to the Hill is it was an opportunity to say thank you to Democrats in Congress who have been fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with him to move the country in a direction that's more fair, that's more just, that's more prosperous, and that's more safe. And over the last eight years, they've made remarkable progress in doing that. And the President has spoken on many occasions about how much of that progress would not have been possible without the tenacity and courage and passion and commitment of Democrats in Congress.\nAnd so he wanted to say thank you, not just in terms of how appreciative he is for their cooperation and their collegiality, but also to thank them on behalf of the country for the progress that we have made. But he also went up there to encourage them, and to motivate them, and to inspire them that even as he leaves and even as somebody who has not committed to working with Democrats on Capitol Hill enters the White House, that Democrats have a set of values and an agenda that's worth fighting for. And Democrats have the benefit, the advantage of being strongly unified around that agenda and around those values, and that will serve them very well because Republicans aren't.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill aren't unified, and they don't appear to be particularly unified when it comes to a bunch of priorities that are being decided by the incoming President-elect, including on the issue of Russia's malicious cyber activity and their interference in our democracy. So that is an advantage that Democrats have, it is an advantage from which they should draw strength, and it is an advantage that I think will serve them very well in the years ahead as they do fight for a set of priorities that President Obama has been trying to advance for the last eight years.\nQ: Given that, last question, is it then fair to say that he is not concerned at all about his legacy, about a dramatic change happening here in Washington once he leaves office? Or would you take the opposite view that he is concerned about a great many of the ideas that he had will be, frankly, undone?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is concerned about the impact that Republicans would have if they made good on their promises to dismantle so much of the progress that we have made over the last eight years. And his concern is rooted in the fact that millions of Americans have access to health care because of what President Obama and Democrats in Congress were able to achieve with the Affordable Care Act. Rolling that back is going to have a negative impact on the lives of those 22 million Americans, but that's what Republicans are promising to do.\nDemocrats in Congress and the administration worked effectively together to implement the Wall Street Reform legislation that has made sure that taxpayers will no longer be on the hook for bailing out big banks who make risky bets that go bad, and they implemented that in a way that the economy still thrived. The stock market more than doubled since that bill was signed into law, and the President is pleased with that progress and is concerned about the impact that it would have on our economy if Republicans roll all that back.\nThe same is true when it comes to a range of national security issues. The same is true when it comes to investments in clean energy. The same is true when it comes to investments in education. So that's what the President's concern is. And the truth is, the only people who -- well, I'd say it this way: The people who are in by far the best position to prevent that from happening are congressional Democrats who are unified around the idea that those things are worth fighting for, and the President is confident that they will, and the President is confident that they're going to have some success in doing it.\nSean.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on one exchange you had with Michelle a little earlier. You said that after the President has been on the national stage for eight years that \"it's time for fresh blood.\"\nI take it you were referencing congressional Democrats, but does the President have satisfaction in the current ranks of the Democratic leadership given that there really hasn't been much fresh blood there? We see Charles Schumer moving up to majority leader in the Senate, but he was already a senior Democrat in the Senate, and the House Democratic leadership looks the same, at least at its highest levels.\nMR. EARNEST: The reference that I was making there was certainly to congressional Democrats, but not just to congressional Democrats.\nThere's an opportunity for mayors and governors and other people who aspire to elective office to make their voices heard. It's not just people who are in elective office who have a responsibility to speak out on the most important issues facing the country. Citizens have that same kind of responsibility, and the President does believe that when he leaves the stage there will be big shoes to fill, and not likely by one person, at the risk of mixing metaphors.\nAnd the President is hopeful, I would say even confident, that there will be Democrats in Congress and across the country who step up to answer the call to fight for the kinds of democratic values that are good the country, that make America more prosperous, that make America more safe, that make America more fair, and that will serve the country and the party very well.\nWith regard to congressional Democrats, the President has deep respect and admiration for the ability of the congressional leaders that have been there the entire time that he's been here for the last eight years. But I think even those leaders would be the first ones to acknowledge they're not going to be able to do it alone. We're going to need to see rank-and-file Democrats standing up and making the case, not just on ABC News, but back home, talking to their people in the communities and making the case to local newspapers and on local radio and on local television stations about what Democrats are fighting for and about what Democrats believe in and why it's in the best interest of the people in those communities.\nSo at one point during the meeting today -- I don't remember who exactly it was -- one of the leaders had suggested that all the newly-elected members of the Democratic caucus should raise their hand to be recognized, and a lot of hands went up. I'm sure somebody was taking attendance at the meeting; I wasn't. I don't think that every member of the Democratic caucus was there. I don't think Senator Manchin was the only one who didn't attend. I don't know what reasons they may have for that, but it sure looked like a lot of the people who were elected for the first time and are serving their second full day in office as a member of the United States Congress spent an hour and a half with the President today.\nAnd I think that's a pretty good indication that the President's words and message has resonated deeply with them, has certainly played at least some part in inspiring them to seek public office. And I think that means that they're more than energized for the fight ahead.\nQ: But as the President looked around at the Senate and the House Democratic caucuses, he must have seen that the numbers are a lot smaller than they have been in previous years. And particularly after the wave election in 2010, a lot of this was a result of the political capital he spent on Obamacare, right? That there was a wave back against the President for passing that legislation. Does he at all acknowledge the political capital that was spent then and have any regret of some of the other legislative priorities he didn't get through, like criminal justice reform, immigration reform, infrastructure -- those other things you mentioned earlier?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there's a lot of analysis that can be done of the 2010 election, and let me just stipulate that I disagree with the analysis that you put forward about that solely being a backlash against the Affordable Care Act. I think the President would acknowledge that capital was spent in terms of passing and implementing the Affordable Care Act. But to a person, I feel confident that Democrats would agree that it was worth it if that's what's required to get 20 million Americans covered on insurance. If we're going to outlaw insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions or charging women more just because they're women -- it's worth it. That's the reason you got into the fight, that's the reason you ran for public office in the first place. It's the reason that you chose to engage in public debate in the first place.\nSo, yes, the President is proud of that and the progress that we've made as a result. Does that answer your question?\nQ: Yes. I have one quick other question. So as far as the Russian hacks go, I know normally you can't discuss sources and methods and how you guys are given intelligence, but can you at least characterize the sort of intelligence that's coming in that proves that this was a Russian hack? Is it digital fingerprints that you're tracing back to a computer in Russian possession? Is it human sourcing, that you're intercepting phone calls and hearing Russians talk about this kind of thing? Or where is the confidence coming from?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm obviously quite limited in what I can say from here, but I think there are a couple of things that I can point to that I think answer the questions that you've raised. It's essentially two.\nThe first is, the statement that was issued by the intelligence community in October of 2016 before the election, making clear that Russia was interfering in our election represented the consensus view of 17 different intelligences agencies. That's not usually the way intelligence works. That kind of unanimity of opinion, particularly when the stakes are so high, is notable. The decision by the intelligence community not just to reach that conclusion, but to make it public, is notable. And I think it reflects the depth of their confidence in that assessment.\nBut your question goes to what explains the depth of that confidence -- why. I think the only thing that -- the thing that I can certainly say from here is that there was a release last week of the Joint Analysis Report that was issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, and included in that report was specific technical advice to computer network operators, systems administrators across the country and around the world about steps that they could take to protect their networks from malicious Russian cyber activity.\nI think that's an indication that there was a deep technical analysis that was done. And being able to put forward that technical analysis so that people could protect themselves from the Russians I think reflects the work that was done that pretty definitively ties this back to the Russians.\nThe other effect of releasing that information means that Russia now has to go back to the drawing board and change some of their tactics. If people who are responsible for defending computer networks are now aware of the places from which those attacks originate, if they're aware of the kinds of tactics that are used in erecting and executing those attacks, if they're aware of the kinds of software, the malware that is used and they can defend their networks against that malware, that's going to make things a lot more difficult for the Russians. So that isn't just an effort to erect defenses to repel malicious Russian activity, it's actually to set back Russian efforts to carry out those kinds of attacks.\nSo I think that is an indication of the depth of the analysis that was done. It's technical in nature, I would stipulate that from the beginning. But I think it's an indication that the intelligence community is following more than their gut instinct. And I think the way that you can tell that is based on the technical analysis that was put forward, and the demonstration of the conviction in their analysis by expressing their unanimous opinion publicly before election about what exactly happened.\nQ: It sounds like, though, that you're pointing more to the digital fingerprint more so than human intelligence. Is there any concern that that could be manipulated if somebody was so smart to manipulate the intel so that it made it look like it was Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm pointing to is the one thing that I feel like I can point to publicly to substantiate some of the claims that we've made. It doesn't mean that there isn't additional evidence out there; I'm sure that there is. But there is a priority that's placed on protecting sources and methods. And with regard to sort of this question about manipulating that kind of digital evidence, I felt confident based on that expertise and technical know-how of the United States intelligence community that that's something that they considered before putting forward that technical information and before putting forward their unanimous high-confidence assessment about what exactly happened.\nBill Press. Nice to see you, Bill.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Nice to see you. Happy New Year.\nMR. EARNEST: Happy New Year.\nQ: I was wondering, having you had an opportunity yet to meet with or to speak with the person who's been designated as your successor at the podium?\nMR. EARNEST: I did have an opportunity yesterday to meet with Sean Spicer, the gentleman that has been hired by the President-elect to succeed me as the White House Press Secretary.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I was going to say, I believe that I had met Sean in passing previously at a social occasion, but this is the first time I had had an opportunity to sit down with him and have a conversation. And yesterday, in my office, we sat down with him and his assistant, and Jen Psaki joined for that conversation, and we had a long conversation about what it's like to work at the White House. And we certainly talked about some of the complicated logistics of working in this environment, but we also talked a little bit about the approach to the job that Jen and I have taken in fulfilling our roles at this White House.\nAnd it was a good conversation, and I know that he's excited about the opportunity -- and he should be. Getting to work at the White House is a genuine honor, and certainly having the opportunity to stand at this podium and speak to all of you, and engage in a debate about a set of issues that I certainly feel strongly about, and to advocate for a President that I respect enormously is a genuine honor. And I think Sean sees it the same way, and he should.\nQ: It has certainly been a question among many of us: Did the subject of whether or not he intends to hold daily press briefings come up in your conversation?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let him speak to whatever plans that he has.\nQ: If it did come up or if it does come up, from your perspective, having been there now for, what, the last four or five years, what would your advice be about the importance or the wisdom of the daily press briefings?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the argument that I've made in the past is I think there is genuine value to the day-to-day engagement that I have with all of you. The symbolic value of the President hiring somebody to play a senior role in his staff, to come out here every day on camera, on the record, and answer whatever question you guys dream up, and be an advocate for the policies that the President has prioritized and be held accountable for knowing what the President thinks, faithfully expressing his view, and being factual and accurate in making that case -- that's a healthy part of our democracy. There aren't many countries in the world that encourage this kind of engagement. So I think it's genuinely a good thing.\nI think there are some aspects of it that are not as efficient as they may have been a generation ago. Before iPhones and Blackberrys and email, there were many fewer opportunities for the press corps to interact with White House staff. But the truth is, I think there's a lot of symbolic value to doing this, and it's good for the country, and I think the President believes that it serves his interest well to have somebody out here making an argument in support of his policies. And I think it certainly serves your viewers and listeners and readers to hear firsthand from somebody at the White House who's willing to stand up here and put their name behind a forceful case and an explanation of what the President is doing and why he's doing it.\nBut obviously the incoming administration will have to make up their own mind about the wisdom of pursuing a strategy that the President believes in because of its role in our democracy, but also because of the way that it's contributed to his success as President.\nDave.\nQ: Josh, Democratic leaders in the California legislature announced today that they've hired Eric Holder as outside counsel to represent the state in what they anticipate will be legal battles against the Trump administration. Does the White House think it's appropriate for a former Cabinet member to get paid to fight the policies of a new administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've seen only the headlines of some of the news reports that you're citing, and there's nothing that struck me in reading those reports that there's anything at all inappropriate about what Mr. Holder was choosing to pursue.\nFirst of all, I'll say that it's not surprising to me at all that the state of California would want to choose somebody as smart and as experienced and well-versed in these policy issues as Mr. Holder is. It's one of the reasons that President Obama chose him to be the Attorney General. Obviously, Mr. Holder is a telegenic, articulate advocate for a whole set of issues, and I suspect that the people of the state of California will benefit from him putting those same skills to work, advocating for them. And it doesn't strike me that there's anything wrong with it.\nQ: The President obviously has been very close to Mr. Holder over the years, considers him a friend. Did he know about this?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about Mr. Holder's new job, but it's certainly true that the President holds Mr. Holder in high regard, both for his intellectual and legal abilities, but also because he's a pretty good guy.\nJared, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple different versions of the Affordable Care Act repeal being discussed. On one hand, you've got reconciliation, which the Senate parliamentarian has ruled doesn't apply to all of the law but only certain parts of it. And then you've got the Vice President-elect and Sean Spicer discussing today the possibility of executive actions that could be taken on day one. Does the legislative team here at the White House have any sense of what could be done to the Affordable Care Act by executive action, and whether any of that would be, in this administration's mind, an improvement of the law?\nMR. EARNEST: I am not aware of what the incoming team may have been referring to with regard to potential changes through executive action that they're looking at. I think the thing that I can faithfully relate to you is that if we had conceived of a way for the President to use executive action to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, then I assure you we would have done it. But look, I think we'll have to let the incoming administration provide some more insight into what their plans are before I can comment on it.\nQ: Do you think that it signals strength or weakness of the plan that executive action is one of the first out of the gate moves for this, or do you not have enough to go on?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's hard to discern at this point exactly what their plans are. I just think that whatever changes they choose to make, they'll be held to a rather high standard for assessing the success or failure of those changes. And we'll be counting on all of you to hold them to that standard.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:54 P.M.

Let me begin by thanking Ash Carter, our Secretary of Defense; General Joe Dunford, Vice Chair Paul Selva, and all of our commanders here.\nThe purpose of this meeting, something I do on a regular basis, is to allow me to hear directly from those who are charged with the most solemn responsibility of maintaining the finest fighting force that the world has ever known and keeping the American people safe. It is in these meetings that we have been able to set broad strategy, identify areas where we have to improve, address the health of the force. And I can say to the American people that they are extraordinarily lucky and I am extraordinarily lucky to be served by such extraordinary patriots.\nThis will be my last meeting with them. And so part of my goal here is just to say thank you to them and let them know how much I appreciate the counsel, the advice, the leadership that they have consistently shown throughout my time in office.\nBut in addition to saying thank you, I will get their views on the fact that we still have a lot of active threats around the world and we still have men and women in harm's way around the world who are busy protecting our homeland and our vital interests and our allies. And we've got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there's continuity, and that any issues that still remain—and obviously, we still have major fights against ISIS in Mosul and in Syria; Afghanistan is still active—that in all of these areas we are doing everything we can to make sure that the next President will benefit from the same kinds of outstanding advice and service that these people around the table have provided me.\nSo it has been, as I've said repeatedly, one of the greatest honors and privileges of being President is serving as Commander in Chief to such outstanding people. And I couldn't have done it without all of you. And I know that my optimism about America going forward is in part because we have such an amazing military, not only one that knows how to fight, but also knows how to uphold the values of rule of law and professionalism and integrity and recognizes our constitutional structure and maintains strict adherence and respect for civilian authority and democratic practices in determining how we use the awesome force of the American military.\nSo I just want to say thank you to all of you. And with that, we've got to do some work. All right?\nThank you so much. I appreciate it.", "timestamp": "2017-01-04", "title": "Remarks During a Meeting With Department of Defense Leadership"}

Thank you. Thank you. Please be seated.\nWell, good afternoon. It turns out, these are easier when you're talking about somebody else. [Laughter] At moments like this, I think of all the times that I've stood before our men and women in uniform, commissioning our newest officers, presiding over promotions, presenting the Commander in Chief's Trophy to the best football team in the military. I will let you argue over that one. [Laughter] I have never taken sides.\nSecretary Carter, I could not be more grateful for your gracious words, but more importantly, for your outstanding leadership across, as you noted, more than three decades and nearly all of my Presidency. You have always given me, Ash, your best strategic counsel. You've made sure that we were investing in innovation for the long term and a strong force for the future. As a physicist, Ash is also one of the few people who actually understands how our defense systems work. And I know that our troops and their families are immensely grateful for the compassion that you and Stephanie have shown them over the years. So to you and your family, on behalf of all of us, thank you for your outstanding service.\nGeneral Dunford, we've relied on you as Commandant of the Marine Corps, as our commander in Afghanistan, and now, as our Nation's highest ranking military officer. I thank you and General Selva and the entire Joint Chiefs for the unvarnished military advice that you've always provided to me, for your dedication, for your professionalism, for you integrity. Because of you, because of this team, our Armed Forces are more integrated and better prepared across domains: a truly Joint Force. Which is why, as a White Sox fan, I can overlook the fact that you love the Red Sox. [Laughter] Moreover, on a personal note, outside of your professional qualities, you are a good man, and I am grateful to have worked with you and thank Ellyn for allowing you to do this.\nTo Members of Congress; Vice President Biden who, along with Jill, has known the love and the pride and the sacrifice of a military family; to Deputy Secretary Work; service secretaries; distinguished guests; dedicated civilians from across the Defense Department; my national security team; most of all, our men and women in uniform: I thank you for this honor, and for the warmth and respect that you've always shown me, the support that you've shown Michelle and our daughters during these past 8 years.\nAnd so, although I recognize that the formalities require me listening to praise directed in large part to me, I want to turn the tables—I am still Commander in Chief—[laughter]—and so I get to do what I want to do—and I want to thank you. Of all the privileges of this office—and there are many—I will miss Air Force One, I will miss Marine One—[laughter]—but I can stand before you today and say that there has been no greater privilege and no greater honor than serving as the Commander in Chief of the greatest military in the history of the world.\nWhen I took office, I noted that Presidents and those of you in uniform swear a similar oath: to protect and defend this country and the Constitution that we cherish. And by stepping forward and volunteering, by raising your right hand and taking that oath, each of you made a solemn pledge. You committed yourself to a life of service and of sacrifice. And I, in turn, made a promise to you, which, to the best of my abilities, I've tried to uphold every single day since: that I would only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, with a strategy and well-defined goals, with the equipment and the support that you needed to get the job done. Because that's what you rightfully expect, and that is what you rightfully deserve.\nI made that pledge at a time when less than 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform. Fewer Americans know someone who serves. And as a result, a lot of Americans don't see the sacrifices you make on our behalf. But as Commander in Chief, I do. I've seen it when I look into the eyes of young cadets, knowing that my decisions could very well send them into harm's way. I've seen it when I visited the field in Bagram and Baghdad, far from your families, risking your lives so that we can live ours safely and in freedom. And so you have inspired me, and I have been humbled by you consistently. And I want every American to know what I know: Through year after year after year of continuous military operations, you have earned your place among the greatest generations.\nThe list of accomplishments that Joe and Ash so generously mentioned, they're because of you. It's what I tell my staff. I'm the front man, but you're the ones doing the work. Because of you, our alliances are stronger, from Europe to the Asia-Pacific. Because of you, we surged in Afghanistan, trained Afghan forces to defend their country, while bringing most of our troops home. Today, our Forces serve there on a more limited mission, because we must never again allow Afghanistan to be used for a safe haven in attacks against our Nation.\nIt's because of you—particularly our remarkable special forces—that the core Al Qaida leadership that attacked us on 9/11 has been decimated. Countless terrorist leaders, including Usama bin Laden, are gone. From South Asia to Africa, we have forged partnerships to go after terrorists that threaten us. Because of you, we are leading the global coalition against ISIL. These terrorists have lost about half of their territory. They are losing their leaders. Towns and cities are being liberated. And I have no doubt this barbaric terrorist group will be destroyed because of you.\nYou've shown that when it comes to fighting terrorism, we can be strong and we can be smart. Not by letting our Forces get dragged into sectarian conflicts and civil wars, but with smart, sustainable, principled partnerships. That's how we've brought most of our troops home, from nearly 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan down to 15,000 today. That's how, even as we've suffered terrible attacks here at home, from Boston to Orlando, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past 8 years.\nBecause of you, the world has seen the awesome reach of American Armed Forces. In some of the first few weeks of my job, when Somali pirates took Captain Phillips, later on, when they kidnapped Jessica Buchanan, it was you that went in and you that risked everything and you that brought these Americans home to their families.\nThe world has seen your compassion: the help you deliver in times of crisis, from an earthquake in Haiti to the tsunami in Japan. Think of Ebola and the countless lives this Armed Forces saved in West Africa. It was you that set up the architecture and set the example for the world's response. One woman in West Africa said, \"We thanked God first, and then we thanked America second, for caring about us.\" That's the difference you make—you continue to make in the lives of people around the world.\nAs you know well, with service comes great sacrifice. And after 15 years of war, our wounded warriors bear the scars: both seen and unseen. In my visits to their bedsides and rehab centers, I have been in awe, watching a wounded warrior grab his walker and pull himself up and through excruciating pain, take a step, and then another. Or hearing troops describe how they grappled with posttraumatic stress, but summoned the strength to ask for help. As a military and as a nation, we have to keep supporting our resilient and incredibly strong wounded warriors as they learn to walk and run and heal. As they find new ways to keep serving our Nation, they need to know that we still need your incredible talents. You've given so much to America, and I know you have more to give.\nAnd then, you have not seen the depths of true love and true patriotism until you've been to Dover when our troops receive our fallen heroes on their final journey home; until you have grieved with our Gold Star families who've given a piece of their heart to our Nation—a son or a daughter, a father or mother, a husband or wife, a brother or a sister—every one a patriot. Every single one of these American families deserves the everlasting gratitude and support of our entire Nation.\nToday, after two major ground wars, our Armed Forces have drawn down, and that is natural, and it is necessary. And after reckless budget cuts of sequester, we need to keep improving the readiness and the training and modernizing our Forces. So let me take this opportunity, while I still have it, to appeal to our friends from Congress who are here: We cannot go back to sequestration. There is a responsible way forward: investing in America's strengths, our national security and our economic security; investing in the reform and the equipment and support that our troops need, including the pay and the benefits and the quality of life and the education and the jobs that our troops and our veterans and all of your families deserve.\nBut make no mistake: Even with the challenges of recent years—and there have been challenges—our allies and adversaries alike understand America's military remains, by far, the most capable fighting force on the face of the Earth. Our Army, tested by years of combat, is the best-trained and best equipped land force on the planet. Our Navy is the largest and most lethal in the world, on track to surpass 300 ships. Our Air Force, with its precision and reach, is unmatched. Our Marine Corps is the world's only truly expeditionary force. Our Coast Guard is the finest in the world.\nAnd we're also the best because this military has come to welcome the talents of more of our fellow Americans. Servicemembers can now serve the country they love without hiding who they are or who they love. All combat positions in our military are now open to women. And Joe Biden and I know that women are at least as strong as men. We're stronger for it. It's one of the reasons that our military stands apart as the most respected institution in our Nation by a mile. The American people look up to you and your devotion to duty and your integrity and your sense of honor and your commitment to each other.\nOne of my proudest achievements is that I have been able to, I think, communicate through the constant partisan haze, along with so many others, how special this institution is, and the esteem in which our military is held has held steady and constant and high throughout my Presidency. And I'm very grateful for that. Because you remind us that we are united as one team. At times of division, you've shown what it means to pull together.\nSo my days as your Commander in Chief are coming to an end, and as I reflect on the challenges we have faced together and on those to come, I believe that one of the greatest tasks before our Armed Forces is to retain the high confidence that the American people rightly place in you. This is a responsibility not simply for those of you in uniform, but for those who lead you. It's the responsibility of our entire Nation. And so we are called to remember core principles: That we must never hesitate to act when necessary to defend our Nation, but we must also never rush into war because sending you into harm's way should be a last and not first resort. It should be compelled by the needs of our security and not our politics. We need to remember that we must not give in to the false illusion of isolationism, because in this dangerous time, oceans alone will not protect us, and the world still seeks and needs our leadership as the one indispensable nation.\nWe have to remember that our military has to be prepared for the full spectrum of threats, conventional and unconventional, from 20th century-style aggression to 21st century-style cyber threats. And when we do go to war, we have to hold ourselves to high standards and do everything in our power to prevent the loss of innocent life, because that's what we stand for. That's what we should stand for. We have to remember that as we meet the threats of our times, we cannot sacrifice our values or our way of life: the rule of law and openness and tolerance that defines us as Americans. That is our greatest strength and makes us a beacon to the world. We cannot sacrifice the very freedoms that we're fighting for.\nAnd finally, in our democracy, the continued strength of our all-volunteer force also rests on something else: a strong bond of respect and trust between those in uniform and the citizens that you protect and defend. At a time when too few Americans truly understand the realities or sacrifices of military service, at a time when many political leaders have not served, if some in the military begin to feel as though somehow they are apart from the larger society they serve, those bonds can fray.\nAs every generation learns anew, freedom is not free. And so while less than 1 percent of Americans may be fighting our wars, 100 percent of Americans can do their parts, at the very least, to support you and your families. Everybody can do something—every business, every profession, every school, every community, every State—to reach out and to give back and to let you know that we care, to help make the lives of our troops and your families just a little bit easier. Everybody can do something.\nAnd that's why Michelle and Jill Biden have mobilized more Americans to honor and support you and your families through Joining Forces. And that's why, even after we leave the White House, Michelle and I intend to keep on looking for ways to help rally more of our fellow citizens to be there for you, just like you've always been there for us.\nSo we can't say it enough and we can't show it enough. Thank you for your patriotism. Thank you for your professionalism. Thank you for your character in representing the very best of the American spirit. Our Nation endures, we live free under the red, white, and blue, because of patriots like you.\nIt has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve with you. I have learned much from you. I'm a better man having worked with you. I'm confident that the United States and our Armed Forces will remain the greatest force for freedom and security that the world has ever known.\nGod bless you and your families. And God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-04", "title": "Remarks at an Armed Forces Full Honor Review Farewell Ceremony at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Virginia"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This Office of the Press Secretary released online versions of the exit memorandums submitted to the President by each Cabinet member. In his remarks, the President referred to Supreme Court Associate Justices Sonia M. Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg; and President-elect Donald J. Trump. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121422", "text": "To my fellow Americans,\nEight years ago, America faced a moment of peril unlike any we'd seen in decades.\nA spiraling financial crisis threatened to plunge an economy in recession into a deep depression. The very heartbeat of American manufacturing—the American auto industry—was on the brink of collapse. In some communities, nearly one in five Americans were out of work. Nearly 180,000 American troops were serving in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the mastermind of the worst terror attack on American soil remained at large. And on challenges from health care to climate change, we'd been kicking the can down the road for way too long.\nBut in the depths of that winter, on January 20, 2009, I stood before you and swore a sacred oath. I told you that day that the challenges we faced would not be met easily or in a short span of time—but they would be met. And after eight busy years, we've met them—because of you.\nEight years later, an economy that was shrinking at more than eight percent is now growing at more than three percent. Businesses that were bleeding jobs unleashed the longest streak of job creation on record. The auto industry has roared its way back, saving one million jobs across the country and fueling a manufacturing sector that, after a decade of decline, has added new jobs for the first time since the 1990s. And wages have grown faster over the past few years than at any time in the past forty.\nToday, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, another 20 million American adults know the financial security and peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Another three million children have gained health insurance. For the first time ever, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured—the highest rate ever. We've seen the slowest growth in the price of health care in fifty years, along with improvements in patient safety that have prevented an estimated 87,000 deaths. Every American with insurance is covered by the strongest set of consumer protections in history—a true Patients' Bill of Rights—and free from the fear that illness or accident will derail your dreams, because America is now a place where discrimination against preexisting conditions is a relic of the past. And the new health insurance marketplace means that if you lose your job, change your job, or start that new business, you'll finally be able to purchase quality, affordable care and the security and peace of mind that comes with it—and that's one reason why entrepreneurship is growing for the second straight year.\nOur dependence on foreign oil has been cut by more than half, and our production of renewable energy has more than doubled. In many places across the country, clean energy from the wind is now cheaper than dirtier sources of energy, and solar now employs more Americans than coal mining in jobs that pay better than average and can't be outsourced. We also enacted the most sweeping reforms since the Great Depression to protect consumers and prevent a crisis on Wall Street from punishing Main Street ever again. These actions didn't stifle growth, as critics predicted. Instead, the stock market has nearly tripled. Since I signed Obamacare into law, America's businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs. And the economy is undoubtedly more durable than it was in the days when we relied on oil from unstable nations and banks took risky bets with your money.\nThe high school graduation rate is now 83 percent—the highest on record—and we've helped more young people graduate from college than ever before. At the same time, we've worked to offer more options for Americans who decide not to pursue college, from expanding apprenticeships, to launching high-tech manufacturing institutes, to revamping the job training system and creating programs like TechHire to help people train for higher-paying jobs in months, not years. We've connected more schools across the country to broadband internet, and supported more teachers to bring coding, hands-on making, and computational thinking into our classrooms to prepare all our children for a 21st century economy.\nAdd it all up, and last year, the poverty rate fell at the fastest rate in almost fifty years while the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record. And we've done it all while cutting our deficits by nearly two-thirds even as we protected investments that grow the middle class.\nMeanwhile, over the past eight years, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland. Plots have been disrupted. Terrorists like Osama bin Laden have been taken off the battlefield. We've drawn down from nearly 180,000 troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan to just 15,000. With a coalition of more than 70 nations and a relentless campaign of more than 16,000 airstrikes so far, we are breaking the back of ISIL and taking away its safe havens, and we've accomplished this at a cost of $10 billion over two years—the same amount that we spent in one month at the height of the Iraq War.\nAt the same time, America has led the world to meet a set of global challenges. Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program, opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, and brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our kids. With new models for development, American assistance is helping people around the world feed themselves, care for their sick, and power communities across Africa. And almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago. All of this progress is due to the service of millions of Americans in intelligence, law enforcement, homeland security, diplomacy, and the brave men and women of our Armed Forces—the most diverse institution in America.\nWe've also worked to make the changing face of America more fair and more just—including by making strides towards criminal justice reform, making progress towards equal pay, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and advancing the cause of civil rights, women's rights, and LGBT rights. I appointed two extraordinary women to the Supreme Court, marking the first time in history that three women sit on the bench, including the first Latina. And today in America, marriage equality is finally a reality across all fifty states.\nThis is where America stands after eight years of progress. By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started—a situation I'm proud to leave for my successor. And it's thanks to you—to the hard work you've put in; the sacrifices you've made for your families and communities; the way you've looked out for one another.\nStill, through every victory and every setback, I've insisted that change is never easy, and never quick; that we wouldn't meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime. And for all that we've achieved, there's still so much I wish we'd been able to do, from enacting gun safety measures to protect more of our kids and our cops from mass shootings like Newtown, to passing commonsense immigration reform that encourages the best and brightest from around the world to study, stay, and create jobs in America.\nAnd for all the incredible progress our economy has made in just eight years, we still have more work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a dignified retirement. We have to acknowledge the inequality that has come from an increasingly globalized economy while committing ourselves to making it work better for everyone, not just those at the top, and give everyone who works hard a fair shot at success.\nAnd here's the thing—over the past eight years, we've shown that we can. Last year, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top. We've also made the tax code fairer. The tax changes enacted over the past eight years have ensured that the top one percent of Americans pay more of their fair share, increasing the share of income received by all other families by more than the tax changes in any previous administration since at least 1960. Simply put, we've actually begun the long task of reversing inequality. But as the global economy changes, we'll have to do more to accelerate these trends, from strengthening unions that speak for workers, to preventing colleges from pricing out hardworking students, to making sure that minimum wage workers get a raise and women finally get paid the same as men for doing the same job. What won't help is taking health care away from 30 million Americans, most of them white and working class; denying overtime pay to workers, most of whom have more than earned it; or privatizing Medicare and Social Security and letting Wall Street regulate itself again—none of which middle-class Americans voted for.\nWe will have to move forward as we always have—together. As a people who believe that out of many, we are one; that we are bound not by any one race or religion, but rather an adherence to a common creed; that all of us are created equal in the eyes of God. And I'm confident we will. Because the change we've brought about these past eight years was never about me. It was about you. It is you, the American people, who have made the progress of the last eight years possible. It is you who will make our future progress possible. That, after all, is the story of America—a story of progress. However halting, however incomplete, however harshly challenged at each point on our journey—the story of America is a story of progress.\nRecently, I asked each member of my talented and dedicated Cabinet to prepare a detailed report on the progress we've made across the board these past eight years, and the work that remains to make this country we love even stronger. Today, I'm sharing them with you. And I hope you'll share them with others, and do your part to build on the progress we've made across the board.\nIt has been the privilege of my life to serve as your President. And as I prepare to pass the baton and do my part as a private citizen, I'm proud to say that we have laid a new foundation for America. A new future is ours to write. And I'm as confident as ever that it will be led by the United States of America—and that our best days are still ahead.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-04", "title": "Letter to the Nation on Cabinet Member Exit Memorandums"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120994", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:24 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Don't all answer at once. (Laughter.)\nQ: Good afternoon.\nMR. EARNEST: I do not have comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. Josh, would you like to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. So some of our intelligence leaders were on the Hill today for quite a while testifying about Russian hacking, among other things. And Clapper talked a lot about what Russia did, but declined to call it an act of war, saying it wasn't really their place to do that. But it seems it would be the place of the White House to make that kind of determination if it felt that it was appropriate. So based on the details that were laid out on the Hill, does the White House feel that the Russian hacking related to the campaign constituted an act of war?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, what I can tell you is that the Obama administration takes very seriously the effort that was undertaken by the Russians to interfere with, and even undermine, the basics of American democracy. And the intelligence community takes that quite seriously, and that was evident from the extraordinary statement that they issued back in October, a month before the election, indicating that they had concluded with high confidence, unanimously, that Russia had undertaken this effort and that this was an effort that could only have been directed from the highest levels of the Russian government.\nI think you can discern the seriousness with which we take this issue. But taking a close look at the report that was issued last week detailing the U.S. government's response to this malicious cyber activity from the Russians -- of course, that report was not comprehensive, but it certainly noted all of the public steps that were taken by the United States government in response. So I think you can discern that President Obama and the rest of the administration takes this issue quite seriously. I don't have a new label to apply to it today, but this is something that has rightly drawn the attention of the American public and certainly drawn the attention of the President of the United States.\nQ: There seemed to be this debate playing out in the course of that hearing about whether intelligence assessments are debatable or irrefutable or open to interpretation, and intelligence officials acknowledging that they put forward information and that policy leaders have to make their own judgments about it. But in light of the President-elect's comments about what the intelligence community has come up with, does the White House think that what the IC has said about Russia's involvement is irrefutable? Is there any interpretation that is open to -- or would you push back on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question a couple different ways. I think the first thing -- and this is a point that I'd made in the past but I think it bears repeating, and I'll keep it brief. The fact that the 17 intelligence agencies of the United States government issued a public high-confidence assessment a month before the election I think should give you an indication of the degree of confidence that those intelligence communities had and have in those conclusions, in that analysis.\nSo this isn't a situation where -- look, there are many situations in which the intelligence community is responsible for drawing upon different strands of partial information and trying to present to policymakers a complete picture. That requires some interpretation. That requires -- in some cases they would probably even say that it's educated guessing. And what the President has always asked is that the intelligence community provide to him their unvarnished assessment. He's also asked the intelligence community to provide dissenting views, if they exist; that surfacing disagreements that exist in the intelligence community actually does serve policymakers well by helping them get a variety of perspectives to try to understand exactly what's happening.\nAnd President Obama has time and again insisted on the unvarnished assessment of the intelligence community. He's insisted on being able to consider dissenting views. The President has insisted that the intelligence that's presented to him should not be shaded to advance a policy or ideological objective. The President has insisted that the intelligence community should not hesitate to present to the President what could be considered bad news, because a white-washed assessment doesn't serve anybody well. Somebody who's consuming this intelligence using rose-colored reading glasses is not going to be able to make good decisions.\nSo the President has time and time again asked the intelligence community to provide him solid, up-to-date, unvarnished assessments about what's happening around the world. And the President's decision-making has been very well-served by that, and the President is entirely confident that that's what they have produced in this case. Because there's not -- again, according to the public statement that we saw from the intelligence community that was issued on paper before the election, based on the testimony that you saw from leaders in the intelligence community today, this is not one of those scenarios where the intelligence community has to make a tough call based only on partial information. They've been quite definitive.\nAnd what you heard from some of those officials today is not just that they continue to have confidence in the assessments that they issued back in October, but based on the work that they have done in the intervening months, they actually have more confidence in the conclusion that they've put forward in October.\nSo I think the other thing that bears mentioning, Josh, is that the men and women of the intelligence community are experts in their field. These are men and women who don't do those jobs because they are getting a big paycheck. In many cases, the men and who serve in our intelligence community are experts who could command a much higher salary in the private sector, but they choose to dedicate their talents to protecting the country. They don't do it for the glory because, in many cases, members of the intelligence community have to do their work in secret, so their names are never made public. And in some cases, those officers have paid the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives for this country. And even now, even though they have made that remarkable sacrifice, their names are prevented from being made public because of the damage it could potentially do to our national security.\nSo the men and women of the United States intelligence community are patriots, they're experts, and they are dedicated to getting the facts right and providing information regardless of their political motivation or their political preference. And President Obama has benefitted enormously from their service, their sacrifice, their professionalism, and their expertise. And the President believes that those qualities will serve the incoming President well if he chooses to draw on that resource in the same way that President Obama has.\nQ: Can you say whether the President has been briefed on the version of the intelligence report that he has now received, and whether there's anything that he learned from that new report that adds to his understanding based on what he knew previously?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you, Josh, is that the White House does have the report, and President Obama is being briefed on it by a range of senior officials who are members of his national security team, some of whom you saw on television earlier today. And --\nQ: It's happening today?\nMR. EARNEST: It's happening right now. And this is -- obviously, the President directed the intelligence community to put together this report last month. He asked them to complete this report before January 20th, so they are beating that deadline by a couple of weeks. And the President has also asked the intelligence community to ensure that they are briefing Congress, which is something that Director Clapper indicated earlier today that he would do.\nHe has asked the intelligence community to brief the President-elect, something that apparently has been scheduled for tomorrow. The President has also directed the intelligence community to make as much of the information that's included in the report public because it's important for the American people to understand that it's our democracy that has been interfered with. And so the people who are participating in that democracy should have as much information as possible about what exactly happened.\nNow, what the intelligence community will also have to do -- and this is a critical priority -- is protect sources and methods. They need to protect their ability to guard against these kinds of intrusions in the future. That's going to limit their ability to make as much public as they probably would otherwise like to do. But they will scrub this report and make as much of it public as they possibly can. But it will be a different version than is consumed by officials at the highest level of the United States government.\nAnd I know that Director Clapper has indicated he's hopeful that he'll be able to produce a public version of the report early next week. But for more precision on the timing of that release, I'd refer you to his office.\nQ: And I think you were alluding to this a moment ago, but I wanted to ask you about the reports that the President-elect's team is considering a shakeup in the way that the intelligence agencies are structured and possibly pulling back some of the employees in some of those key agencies. Have any of the intelligence agencies, to your knowledge, received any request for information from Trump's transition team that you believe could be used to try to do that kind of a restructuring? And is the President urging his successor not to dismantle the intelligence apparatus, as we know it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, a couple things about this, Josh. I did have a chance to read that report that I think surfaced last night that was attributed to anonymous transition officials. I know that there are other transition officials speaking on the record who denied that report today. So I think it's difficult to tell exactly what the incoming President's plans actually are.\nThat being said, the President tasked his administration and agencies all across his administration to be very focused on ensuring a smooth and effective transition with the incoming President's team, and that includes the intelligence community.\nI can't speak with a lot of precision about the conversations that have already taken place, but I know that there already -- there's been extensive planning and a variety of conversations that have already taken place to try to prepare the incoming President and his team to assume responsibility for U.S. national security, including responsibility for the intelligence community. But I can't speak to what plans they may have for reforming the intelligence community. But obviously when he enters the Oval Office on January 20th, he'll have an opportunity to consider what kinds of reforms he believes would best serve him, his team, and the country.\nBut I'll just say one more time how much President Obama has benefitted from the service and sacrifice of the professionals and patriots who serve this country every day, working around the clock, on weekends, over the holidays, to ensure the safety and security of the country.\nQ: But I guess that's the point right there, though. I mean, are you hearing from the intelligence officials who currently report to this President and this administration that they're demoralized by the disparagement that is coming from the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that Director Clapper and others had the opportunity to speak to this today, and I think -- well, we heard Director Clapper express concern about some of the President-elect's comments and tweets having a negative impact on morale. And that certainly is unfortunate. These are -- like I said, these are men and women who could get a much bigger paycheck in the private sector. These are men and women who don't get a lot of glory and fame for their work. These are men and women who work long days and late nights and over the weekend and over the holidays to keep us safe. And they are worthy of nothing less than our deep gratitude for their service and for the safety and security that we enjoy because of their service.\nAyesha.\nQ: Just one more question on the intelligence briefing. Are you expecting that the President will give like a formal response to the report, or will there be something in writing? Will there be some type of response from the President?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I would not expect a formal response from the President of the United States. Obviously, if that changes, we'll make sure that all of you know. But at this point, that's not part of the plan. Presumably, at some point in the next few days, the President will have an opportunity to answer questions about this. So to the extent that there is a response from President Obama about some of this, I would anticipate that it would come in that form.\nQ: On another subject, going back to -- which was a big topic yesterday, was the meeting on Obamacare and basically strategizing with the Democrats on what to do next. I wanted to kind of clarify -- does the President still believe that Democrats should work with Republicans to help make changes to Obamacare or to repeal and replace Obamacare? Or is the idea that if they're going to repeal it and replace it, that Democrats should sit back and just kind of let the Republicans deal with the consequences of that? What exactly is the President's position on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this is an excellent question and I think your colleague, Michelle, asked a similar version of this yesterday. And this is important. The President's approach from day one, since the day that he signed the Affordable Care Act into law back in March of 2010 -- so we're talking about almost seven years ago -- the President has indicated not just an openness but a desire to work closely with Democrats and Republicans around ideas to further strengthen the law.\nThe President has even put forward some of his own suggestions for how the law could be strengthened; increasing tax credits to families to make some health care purchases even more affordable. The President has also even floated the possibility of enhancing competition in some areas of the country that don't currently have a lot of competition by introducing a public option in some of those communities. By enhancing competition, you could foster better options at potentially a lower cost.\nThese are some of the ideas the President has put forward. These are the kinds of ideas that you would expect Republicans to be able to support. Republicans spent a lot of time talking about free-market solutions and tax cuts for working people. This falls squarely in that category.\nBut the point here, Ayesha, is that the President has put forward specific ideas for strengthening the law. He has welcomed -- or he would welcome Republicans and Democrats working together to implement some of those ideas to strengthen the law. That has been true throughout his presidency, and that will be true into the next presidency.\nBut unfortunately, that is not the approach that Republicans have pursued. Republicans, rather than being willing to look for solutions, have been focused for seven years on just trying to either sabotage the law, or to repeal it outright. And when I say \"sabotage,\" I'm making a reference to repeated lawsuits that Republicans have filed in courts to try to interfere with the implementation of the law. I'm referring to Republican governors who have refused, in the face of all common sense, to expand Medicaid in their state.\nThe expansion of Medicaid is paid almost entirely by the U.S. government. We know that providing essentially charity care -- health care to people who can't afford health insurance -- is a significant drain on state budgets. We know that it would improve health care outcomes because people would be getting checkups more often. So people would be healthier, lives would be saved, and it would save money for all these states. But because Republican governors think that politics are more important than saving money, more important than saving lives, they've blocked Medicaid expansion in far too many places.\nSo the Republican idea of sabotaging the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is not new. And fortunately, they've been unsuccessful. They've been unsuccessful in repealing the law. They voted 50 times to repeal it and they haven't succeeded. And despite their best efforts to undermine the implementation of the law, we've actually seen that 20 million Americans have gotten health insurance because of the law. We've seen that since the law was signed into force, that health care costs have risen at the slowest rate on record. So despite these Republican efforts, the law remains in place and it has worked.\nSo the advice that the President has to Democrats is if Republicans are willing to actually focus on a constructive effort to strengthen the law, that Democrats should work with them. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is not strengthening the law. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is taking health care away from up to 30 million Americans. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is to shorten and weaken -- shorten the lifespan of and weaken Medicare. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is to take away consumer protections that currently prevent Americans from being discriminated against because they have preexisting conditions.\nHHS recently released a report indicating that more than 130 million Americans have preexisting conditions, and they can't be discriminated against or prevented from signing up for health insurance right now because of the Affordable Care Act. So that's 130 million Americans who are going to have this protection stripped away if Republicans follow through on their plan.\nSo that's not strengthening the law. There's no reason that Republicans should -- or that Democrats should be a party to a Republican effort to tear that law down. But if Republicans are actually interested in trying to strengthen the law and improve outcomes for the American people, then Democrats absolutely have a responsibility to work with them.\nQ: And will that depend on then the idea of what strengthening means? Because, I mean, obviously, they're going to repeal it -- they say they're going to repeal it.\nMR. EARNEST: They say that, but we'll see if -- you know, the President spent a lot of time talking about this yesterday. Republicans have a tough road to hoe. The promise of it sounds really good, and that's why you heard them repeat it on the campaign trail so often: \"We're going to repeal Obamacare.\" That was typically met by cheers from people in the crowd, many of whom probably were benefitting from Obamacare. Trying to explain that situation is something that you'll have to turn to somebody else for.\nBut the point that the President has made is that there's one thing -- saying it on the campaign trail and getting raucous cheers from a political rally is one thing. Actually implementing the repeal and governing the country is yet another. Reckoning with the consequences of 130 million Americans having critically important protections being stripped away, that's pretty complicated. That doesn't roll right off the tongue at a campaign rally. Taking health care away from 30 million Americans -- that's something that you have to explain and compensate for once you start governing, once the campaigning has ended.\nSo I do not think that it is a foregone conclusion, particularly because Democrats are united around the idea that the Affordable Care Act is something that's worth protecting. And we see lots of Republicans, including Senator Rand Paul, who voted against the reconciliation bill yesterday, expressing a lot of heartburn -- no pun intended -- about the idea of repealing the law in a way that's going to weaken it, and in a way that's going to take health care away from people and take away protections that are actually popular.\nSo I don't think it's a foregone conclusion, and I think Democrats should draw a lot of confidence from the kind of position that they're in right now to defend a law that is producing for the American people. And the prospect of taking it away may sound good when it comes to the rhetoric, but when it comes to explaining exactly what they're doing, I think it's going to give those politicians a lot of pause.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to go back to when you were talking about dissenting views and sort of in the context of these conclusions that have been made. Trying to connect I think the two things that you said, would it be fair to take away that there were no sort of dissenting views in any of the -- obviously, everybody signed off on this conclusion.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: But it is accurate to say that within the ranks of the intelligence community there was kind of universal agreement that Russia was responsible for this attack and some of the sort of motivations that we've heard ascribed to Russia for the attack?\nMR. EARNEST: So you're right that the public statement that was issued back in October, a month before the election, that did indicate that Russia was engaged in an effort to undermine our democracy did represent the consensus view of all 17 intelligence agencies.\nFor the opinions of individual officers in those agencies, I think you'd have to go to them directly to get their opinion. But --\nQ: Well, what I'm wondering I guess is, is this report going to have -- oftentimes reports are issued -- the evaluation of something, you will hear from dissenters why they might question conclusions that were reached or an evaluation of alternate theories for what might have happened. And so I'm wondering if we can expect those sorts of things to be included in the publicly released information, or if it will just be -- and it might be that there's universal agreement that Russia was responsible. But that's just --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think this is an entirely fair question, but it's not one that I'm in a position to answer. I don't know what's going to be included in the report that is produced early next week. That's something that the intelligence community is working on, so we'll have an opportunity to take a look at it there. And then maybe we could have some more questions about this.\nBut look, the other thing I think I would encourage you to do is to check with some of these intelligence agencies and to see to what extent they factored in dissenting views, or if those dissenting views didn't exist.\nQ: Buzzfeed reported that the FBI relied on a third-party analysis of the DNC servers to sort of reach their conclusions that Russia was responsible for this hacking. I'm wondering if that raised any concern within the White House. It seems like a credible third party. But obviously I think some of the critics on the transition team have said this is the equivalent of the FBI not going to the crime scene itself to look at it.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I can't speak to the investigative methods that were used by the FBI and the wisdom of the approach that they pursued. So I'd refer you to them for a comment on that.\nQ: Director Clapper said in his testimony today that Russia may have been responding to cyberespionage activities that the U.S. had taken. So I'm wondering if you -- I guess if the White House believes that the Russian actions were potentially retaliatory rather than sort of proactively trying to interfere with American democracy.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the conclusion from the intelligence community before the election was that the Russian government was motivated based on direction that was received at the highest levels of the government to interfere, undermine, or raise doubts about U.S. democracy and our political institutions. Whether there were additional motives that Russia may have had, that's something that I'd refer you to the intelligence community to assess.\nBut I guess the point that -- the thing that I would point out independent of any special or classified knowledge is simply that the two motives that you cited are in no way contradictory. You could imagine a scenario -- I don't know if it's true or not -- that Russia would be motivated for one reason or another to try to retaliate against the United States for some sort of perceived slight, and that retaliation would take the form of undermining confidence in U.S. democracy. So it's easy to see how those two things aren't mutually exclusive.\nQ: One last one on a totally different topic. Some Turkish defense officials earlier this week seemed to float the idea of ending the use by the U.S. coalition of Incirlik Air Base. There seems to be some frustration over the level of U.S. and international support for their operation in Syria. What's the level of concern in the administration that -- you've spoken many times about how important that air base is and what it could mean for our attempts to go after ISIL.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I will say is that NATO is obviously a critically -- Turkey is a critically important NATO Ally, and we have benefitted from our alliance with Turkey, and we obviously have valued the partnership and commitment that they have shown to going after ISIL.\nOne of the priorities that we identified early on was the need for Turkey to take steps to secure their border with Syria, and they didn't take those steps as quickly as we would have liked, but in the last several months we have seen them take definitive action that has had a positive impact in securing that border that is limiting the ability of ISIL to smuggle people and materiel across that border into Syria.\nSo we obviously are pleased that Turkey has taken those steps. In general, the United States has been strongly supportive of the steps that Turkey has taken, and we have offered them additional support to supplement some of their ongoing efforts against ISIL right now. I think that it is -- it would seem to undermine their case to threaten to eliminate our access to the Incirlik Air Base. Presumably some of the kind of assistance that we could provide would originate from Incirlik Air Base.\nSo it feels a little like cutting off one's nose to spite your face. And hopefully that's not in the cards.\nLynn Sweet. Welcome back to the White House Briefing Room. It's always a treat to have you here.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Why are you looking at me like that?\nQ: I have a question.\nMR. EARNEST: That's why I called on you.\nQ: Thank you. With President Obama coming home to Chicago on Tuesday for his farewell address, is there any message that you could share now that he may have or want to sort of reflect on as the city is grappling with a soaring murder rate? It certainly is on the mind of a lot of people in Chicago as he comes home and as he intends to put his Obama Center in a part of the city that's so very hard-hit by homicide. And could you also rule in or out if the President is going to give any kind of commutation to now-in-prison Governor Rod Blagojevich? As you know, the nature of the crime, one of the reasons he's in prison, is in part for the attempt to try to sell then-Senator Obama's Senate seat. So I'm hoping you could have some reflections.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any comment on potential offers of clemency. There's a process that we have --\nQ: He has applied.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, but there's a process that will be administered by the Department of Justice, and so I don't have any comment on that.\nWith regard to the violence that has been plaguing the city of Chicago, you've heard the President over the last couple of years talk about his deep concern about the violence that's plaguing his hometown. And he is certainly concerned about the use of illegal firearms in a lot of that violence. He believes that there are additional common-sense steps that could be taken that would at least reduce the number of illegal guns that are so readily available on the street.\nHe also believes that there are some simple things that could be done to make those guns a little harder to get, particularly for people that have bad intentions and shouldn't have them in the first place. That's not going to prevent every act of gun violence, but it certainly would have a positive impact.\nThe President has also talked about some of the work that needs to be done in the community there. And the President is certainly interested in investing in the My Brother's Keeper initiative. This is a program that has been implemented in a number of communities across the country, including Chicago, to try to mentor boys and young men of color who too often go overlooked. And the President is hopeful that when he leaves the White House, this is something that he'll be able to devote more of his time and attention to.\nI know the President and First Lady are also optimistic about the potential of the Obama Presidential Center having a positive economic impact on the South Side of Chicago. And he is hopeful that that will spur some economic activity and be a beneficial influence in the community. And many of the plans for the Presidential Center are focused on maximizing the benefits for the surrounding community. Obviously, this work is in the earliest of stages, but in the years ahead I know that both President Obama and Mrs. Obama will be making the positive impact on the local community one of the highest priorities of the Presidential Center.\nQ: Quick follow-up. The foundation has said that some programming is going to start in 2017 then. Are they going -- it's years away from this being built and up and running, the center. So is there something that they're going to be doing programming-wise, without the center being built, but since the foundation is up and running in Chicago anyway? Will they wait for the bricks and mortar to be there, or will they, once they leave the White House, try to get some programs going through My Brother's Keeper or other -- My Brother's Keeper Alliance, which now is a nonprofit, or any other entity?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any specific programs that --\nQ: That's my main thing -- are they going to wait until the thing is built, which is years away, or do something sooner?\nMR. EARNEST: I think they are very interested in trying to make an immediate impact because this is obviously a community that is very close to them, and this is obviously where Mrs. Obama grew up and a place where President Obama spent most of his adult life. So this is a community that is close to their hearts and one that will get a lot of their attention beginning in 2017.\nQ: Do you know if he's been by Jackson Park, or she has?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that question.\nQ: Will he swing by it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of plans to do that on this trip, but I haven't looked carefully at the schedule. So obviously if he does something like that, the presidential pool will be along for the ride.\nIsaac.\nMR. EARNEST: You were speaking earlier about the high regard of the President of both the intelligence community and the work that they do. Is he concerned about the demoralizing effect that some people have talked about from the way the President-elect has spoken about them and the assessments being made in a way that would make America less safe over the course of the years to come from that demoralizing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that Director Clapper gave voice to some of these concerns in his testimony today. He indicated that some of the rhetoric and comments could potentially have a negative impact on the morale of the United States intelligence community. And I think I would leave it to Director Clapper to assess what sort of impact that could potentially have on our national security.\nBased on what I know of our men and women in the intelligence community, they're professionals. And even in the face of some of the rhetoric that we've seen, they're determined to do their job for the right reason: to keep the American people safe. And they will do their job to the best of their ability without regard to who they would prefer to see in the Oval Office, and I'm confident that that work will continue and it will continue to be executed faithfully by the patriots in the intelligence community.\nQ: But the President doesn't share Director Clapper's concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President would -- I think what is clear to anybody, even those of us who are not in the intelligence community, is it's hard to imagine how some of the rhetoric and comments we've seen would have a positive impact on morale in the intelligence community. But I think President Obama would share my assessment about the professionalism of the men and women in the intelligence community, but he would also listen carefully to the assessment of somebody like Director Clapper when considering what the potential impact of those comments and that rhetoric could be on the intelligence community broadly.\nQ: On a totally different topic, is the President excited about Tom Perriello's candidacy for governor in Virginia?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw a news report in the Times today. I don't know that Mr. Perriello has made an official announcement, unless that's happened since --\nQ: It's happening.\nMR. EARNEST: It's happening right now, huh?\nQ: They put out a video this morning.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President intends to endorse in the race, but obviously Mr. Perriello has served this administration with distinction. And the President did enjoy a close working relationship with him in Congress and appreciated his commitment to a set of democratic values in the context of his service in Congress. It was all too short, in the President's view.\nQ: But you don't think that he would get involved in this?\nMR. EARNEST: But I'm not aware that the President will offer an endorsement, but maybe in his role as a former President of the United States he'll have more time to consider these kinds of decisions. So I'm not in a position to rule out an endorsement, but I'm not aware of one that's planned.\nMegan.\nQ: Josh, do you expect the President will be calling the President-elect after today's briefing?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not expect a phone call will occur between the President and the President-elect today.\nQ: How often have they been communicating?\nMR. EARNEST: Many of their telephone conversations have been reported publicly, but I have tried to protect their ability to have private conversations by not talking about them too much publicly myself. So I said a few weeks ago that they have had a handful of conversations. They've had more conversations since then. So I don't know if now it's two handfuls or not. But they continue to be in touch.\nQ: Will the report be sent to Congress today? And do we have an idea of when lawmakers are going to be briefed?\nMR. EARNEST: Director Clapper's office will be responsible for disseminating the report and following the President's instruction to ensure that Congress is appropriately briefed. I don't know that the timing for all that has been laid out at this point, but you can check with his office and they can keep you up to date on that. But the President's expectation -- and I think this is something that Director Clapper committed to -- is that Congress will be briefed on the results of the report, and I would expect that to happen soon.\nQ: And then piggybacking off of Josh's question, as far as the President's view of any kind of intelligence community shakeup that the Trump transition team may or may not be considering, what would the President think specifically about doing away with the DNI -- with the role of the Director of the National Intelligence?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, listen, I think -- obviously, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created to address an intelligence failure in the first place. And the President has benefitted from the organizing function that Director Clapper's office has performed in drawing on the material that's collected by the wide variety of intelligence agencies all across the U.S. government. And so serving as that organizing function I think is valuable.\nLook, I think I would also add that Director Clapper is somebody who has served as the Director of National Intelligence more for than six years now. And President Obama has felt enormously well served by the way that he has handled the significant responsibilities of that office. But that's not new when you're talking about somebody like Director Clapper. Director Clapper enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1961, and he is somebody who began his career in the military as a rifleman in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. He is somebody who served in the Air Force and flew 73 combat support missions over Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.\nThis is somebody who has put his life on the line to protect this country, and he didn't do that because he got drafted, he did that because he signed up. And since then, he has had a career of public service that's included him rising to the level as a Lieutenant General in the United States Air Force. And he is somebody who has served Presidents in both parties. He is somebody who is committed to the safety and security of this country. And we owe him -- as he noted in his testimony today, he is ending his career in public service in January 20th, and we certainly owe him a deep debt of gratitude for his service to the country, not just as a Director of National Intelligence, but for the six decades that he has selflessly served this country.\nQ: Would the President advise the President-elect of any room for improvement within the intelligence community?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think what the President would say is that the incoming President and his team should take a close look at the intelligence community, and if they have proposals or ideas for implementing reforms that would ensure that the country is better served, then that's something that they should carefully consider. But the current structure that's in place now and the individuals who populate the highest ranks of that organizational chart have served President Obama enormously well. And he is hopeful that the incoming President will benefit from the same kind of sound advice and expertise that has made the United States safer over the last eight years.\nMichelle.\nQ: So are you saying that the President would say he shouldn't change it if it has served him so well, meaning the structure?\nMR. EARNEST: I think President Obama is simply someone who has benefitted enormously from the current structure and the people who serve in that structure. But obviously the President-elect will have an opportunity to consider if a new structure would be better for him.\nLook, we've already spent some time in here previously talking about how the President-elect has chosen to handle this information somewhat differently than President Obama has. The President-elect has declined to get daily intelligence briefings from the intelligence community. So he clearly has different ideas for how this should work. President Obama believes that he was well served by getting this material briefed to him every day, and he believed that having a structure in place to support that was good for the country and good for his ability to make a good decision. But it may be that the President-elect has some different ideas.\nQ: So is there nothing about the current structure that President Obama would change?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think this is going to be entirely up to President-elect Trump to decide, but President Obama has been enormously well served by the people that are in the current structure.\nQ: Okay. And we heard the Speaker of the House today say publicly in an interview that Russia did not affect the outcome of this election. Do you think that's a fair thing to say? Is that something that can even be known, given the intelligence that has been out there?\nMR. EARNEST: I was not able to listen to the entirety of the testimony, so I'm relying on you to provide the context for what was said. I suspect that the point that was being made is simply the idea that the intelligence community has concluded that Russia did not succeed in tampering with voting rolls in a way that would interfere with the ability of people to cast a ballot and have it counted. So from that standpoint, there's no evidence that the vote tally was manipulated.\nFor the broader political impact of the hack-and-leak strategy that the Russians implemented, this is a strategy that obviously had a negative effect on that Democratic candidate for President. I think that's something that people will be assessing for quite some time. I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the case that it had a positive impact on the Democratic campaign. But ultimately, what was the -- how much of an impact it had I think is something that will be subject to debate for quite some time.\nQ: Because I think in the past when you were asked, \"Did this hurt Democrats, did it hurt Clinton in particular,\" you would say, well, that's up to analysts. But you're saying that it's obvious that the Russian meddling did hurt Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: I think particularly the week or so before we left for the holidays, I think I made pretty clear the ample evidence that is available to anybody who was paying attention --\nQ: I mean, I think then we were talking about intent, that it was clearly designed to hurt Democrats. But you're saying that it was obvious that it had a negative effect on Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: I just wanted to make sure that is what you're talking about.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, again, I don't think that's different than what I said in December. I haven't -- I watch a lot of cable television and I read a lot of newspapers, and I haven't heard anybody come out and say that having John Podesta's emails leaked on a daily basis, every day, for the last three weeks leading up to Election Day was good for the Clinton campaign. That would certainly be a controversial analysis. It would cut against the grain. But I think you'd be pretty hard-pressed to make that case.\nQ: Okay, fine. And today, Senator Graham said that it's time at this point to throw rocks at Russia, and not just pebbles. So if we're going to go with the analogy of throwing stones, the response that this administration has put out there against Russia, do you consider that a pebble, or is that a rock?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's a hard thing to assess. I'll let Senator Graham put forward his own analogies. I think what -- or metaphors.\nQ: I mean, we know what the point is, that he and others at this hearing are implying that it's not enough. So --\nMR. EARNEST: And I think what I would say is that this is a forceful response. It's not the sum total of the response, but the public report that was issued last week that detailed the Russian government agencies being sanctioned, that detailed the PNGing of Russian diplomats from the United States, the closing of a couple of diplomatic facilities, the Joint Analysis Report that was issued that will interfere with Russia's ability to carry out these kinds of operations in the future, both because by releasing this information system's administrators in the United States and around the world can better protect their computer networks against the malware and the tactics that are employed by the Russians.\nSo that won't just improve the defenses of these networks, it also means the Russians have to go back to the drawing board to look for new tactics and design new malware. That is going to interfere with their ability to continue to carry out these actions moving forward.\nSo what you have seen is a serious response, and you haven't seen the sum total of it. And I know that there are some, including some members of the President-elect's team, who fretted that the response was too severe. So they're certainly entitled to their opinion, but the President believes that the serious effort that Russia undertook to interfere in our election deserves to be met with a serious response, and that's what was announced last week.\nQ: Okay, and lastly on -- we also heard Senator McCain today. When he was asked was that hack an act of war, he said in the broader sense he believes yes. And I know you don't want to add any additional labels, but what we have here was an attack that you said was designed to undermine essentially democracy in America. So how do you draw the line in the cyber world? What is an act of war and what isn't?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, what the intelligence community has assessed is that it certainly interfered with our democracy, or the aim was to interfere with our democracy and to undermine public confidence. And that's their assessment. And one of the challenges that policymakers will face, not just in the next administration but probably in subsequent administrations, is establishing some norms in this new realm. In cyberspace, these norms don't exist. And it's a brave new world out there, and it poses some risks. It obviously -- in cyberspace, we've got enormous capabilities to strengthen our economy, to make it easier for small businesses to do business around the globe, to make our lives more convenient, and, in some cases, to make our lives more secure.\nThose are all good things, but there are risks associated with those kinds of developments, and establishing some norms in cyberspace is important. And one area where we have made some progress on this is with regard to our relationship with China, where the United States has reached an agreement with China to establish a norm that state-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft for commercial purposes is not something that's appropriate in cyberspace. And you heard the intelligence officials today indicate that they have seen a reduction in the kind of malicious cyber activity emanating from China targeting U.S. businesses.\nThat's a positive impact. Does that entirely solve the problem? Of course not. But it does give us a sense of the kinds of solutions that we need to consult to enhance our security in cyberspace. And this is not something that's going to get solved overnight, and this is not likely to be solved in the term of the next President, but it's something that policymakers will be grappling with for quite some time.\nQ: How is it not an act of war, then, to attack democracy in this way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is something that is deeply serious, and something that the administration takes quite seriously. And I think that's evident not just from the public comments you've seen from the intelligence community, but that's also evidence from the response that's been put forward.\nBob.\nQ: Hey, Josh. Back on the Affordable Care Act for a moment. How involved does the President plan to stay in what I'll go so far as to say will be the replacement process, which is probably going to come piecemeal? He was up on the Hill yesterday asking Democrats to hold fast against any major changes to this overall program we call Obamacare. How much does Barack Obama expect the Democrats to seek his counsel or give his blessing to \"this change is good, that change isn't good\" -- something along those lines? How involved can he stay in all of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, as we discussed earlier, the advice that President Obama had for Democrats is that they should fight against the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act because of the extraordinarily negative impact it would have on millions of Americans, including the 30 million Americans who would lose health insurance, and including the 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions who would lose the protection against -- that prevents insurance companies from discriminating against them. That only happened because of the Affordable Care Act, and stripping that protection away would have a negative impact on a large number of Americans.\nThe argument that the President has made is that isn't just bad for the American people and bad for our economy and bad for the deficit, it's also bad politics. So I don't think it's a foregone conclusion, and the President certainly doesn't think it's a foregone conclusion that Republicans will succeed in repealing the law. They were only able to marshal 51 votes yesterday in the Senate to merely instruct committees to see if they could come up with a way to repeal the law. So they've got a very narrow margin for error, particularly when you consider how united Democrats are. And so that's the advice that President Obama had for Democrats.\nWith regard to the role that he can play in his post-presidency, I would not expect for him to play a large public role in this fight. If there are people who want to seek his counsel, either for policy solutions or for particularly persuasive arguments that can be made publicly, I wouldn't be surprised if he engages in those kinds of private conversations -- not regularly, but I wouldn't be surprised if something like that occurred.\nBut as I mentioned yesterday, the President's expectation is that congressional Democrats and Democrats across the country are going to have to stand up and speak out. And if they do, that will serve the country well, it will prevent Republicans from succeeding in repealing the Affordable Care Act, and it will provide an excellent opportunity for a new generation of Americans, a new generation of Democrats to step forward and begin to make their voice heard and exercise some influence in our political debate and, again, in a way that would be good for the country and good for the Democratic Party.\nMark.\nQ: Couple more in general terms about the review the President is being briefed on now. I realize he's still getting briefed, but does he have any initial reaction as to what he's seen? Does he think this report contains something substantial and new that he hasn't already been briefed on? And does it contain any smoking guns that would convince skeptics?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the report, so I wouldn't characterize it at this point about whether or not it includes smoking guns or other things.\nI think just the caution that I would point out is that while the intelligence community is committed to fulfilling the President's instructions to make public as much as possible, they're sharply limited in their ability to produce a lot of information given the need to protect sources and methods.\nSo I haven't seen the report. I don't know what will be included in the report. But I do anticipate that it will be difficult to produce something like that, but we'll have to see what they come forward with. And ultimately, I think we'll -- I'll be making -- I'll be exercising some of our own judgment about what exactly the report means.\nSo since the President is getting briefed on it right now, I haven't gotten a reaction from him. But presumably, at some point, the President will be asked about it and he'll have an opportunity to offer up that reaction.\nQ: Admittedly, chunks of it are not going to be able to made public, so the public might not be convinced. But obviously one recipient of the full report is going to get briefed on it tomorrow. Is this report going to be convincing to that recipient?\nMR. EARNEST: There are a number of things that come to mind that I could say in response to that question, but I'll exercise some discretion today and say we'll see.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I know, I know.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to draw your attention to something that was circulating online yesterday, a beating that apparently took place on Facebook Live involving four individuals in Chicago. Is the White House aware of this video? Would the President himself have been aware of this, and would he have any comment about what happened?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I've seen the video in news coverage, and I know that local officials, law enforcement officials are investigating this matter. Based on news reports that I've seen, some individuals who were likely involved are in custody. So they are still conducting an investigation about the disturbing images that we saw in that video.\nThey do demonstrate a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans. I haven't spoken to the President about it, but I'm confident that he would be angered by the images that are depicted on that video. But I believe it's important for us to defer to the important work that local law enforcement must do in investigating these kinds of incidents, so I don't want to say a whole lot more than that.\nBut obviously this is something that's gotten a lot of attention, and for good reason.\nQ: Would this rise to the level of a hate crime in your opinion?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's too early to tell. I certainly don't want to predict where the investigation would lead. I think our expectation would be that local law enforcement would follow the facts. And I wouldn't speculate at this point to what degree federal officials would get involved for considering those kinds of crimes. Obviously, a decision by the Department of Justice to investigate a matter like this is something that -- is a decision that they would have to make alone.\nQ: I want to piggyback on something Justin was talking about earlier, and that is this idea that the President gets briefed on this report, and yet sanctions and other decisions were doled out on the Russians prior to the completion of the report. And I'm wondering, does that mean there was sufficient evidence in the administration's opinion prior to the completion of the report that the President is receiving a briefing on now to make that action? And if that's the case, why not wait until the report itself was complete?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, there was a desire on the part of the U.S. government to be forceful in our response, but also to be very precise in our response. And that meant that there were a variety of agencies, including the Treasury Department and the Department of State, and others, had to carefully evaluate how best to use the tools that were available to them to implement a response to this situation, and as soon as those response options had been considered and developed, that we worked to implement them quickly.\nThere was no need to wait for additional evidence to substantiate the kind of response that was put forward. And again, I think based on the unprecedented nature of the statement that was issued by the intelligence community a month before the election, I think that should be a clear indication to everybody of the depth of conviction, the high confidence that the intelligence community had in the conclusions that they publicized back in October.\nQ: Is that report, the one the President is being briefed on, it wasn't completed last week; it was, in fact, completed very recently -- yesterday, for example?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that Director Clapper indicated in his testimony today that the report was only recently completed.\nQ: Let me ask you about the exit statements. It's an interesting approach. I don't think I've ever read exit statements like we've seen in previous administrations sort of so publicly dispensed. What was the thinking behind that, and why is that important?\nMR. EARNEST: These are the exit memos from the Cabinet agencies?\nQ: Yeah.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, over the course of the last year, the President has directed his team to be focused on ensuring a smooth and effective transition to the next administration. And that was a tasking that the President gave to officials in a wide variety of agencies before we knew the outcome of the election.\nBut in that process, these agencies were compiling material to help the incoming team hit the ground running to understand what kinds of issues they were likely to inherit, to understand what kinds of strategies we had implemented, and what kind of results we had to show for the strategy that we implemented. And in developing this material, it became clear that these memos would provide the American people a lot of insight into the important work that's been done over the last eight years, into the progress that we've made over the last eight years, but also in the challenges that remain.\nAnd the President made a decision -- and, again, I think this is consistent with his commitment to transparency -- he said, let's make these memos public, and let's share with the American people in a comprehensive fashion -- let's show them our work, let's show them what we've done, but let's also be honest about the challenges that remain.\nAnd we've talked before about what the outcome of the election means for the country, and it means that somebody who has promised to try governing the country in a different way is going to get the opportunity to do that. And there will be an opportunity for all of you and for the American public to evaluate what kind of progress they're making. We've established benchmarks about the progress that the country made in the last eight years under President Obama's leadership, and you'll be able to compare the progress that was made under President Obama with the results of the incoming administration's leadership. And I think that should inform people -- it will inform people about the most effective way to lead the country in the future.\nAnd if the incoming administration is able to exceed these benchmarks in a whole variety of areas, that obviously would be a powerful endorsement of the approach that President Trump chooses to take. If not, it won't be.\nQ: Couple quick ones. First, on Gitmo, is it your expectation that there will be a reduction in the number of detainees again this week? And can you sort of clarify the administration's perspective on the recidivism rate of those who have either gone back into battle and have either been re-apprehended, or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I am not able to speak to any specific detainee transfers between now and January 20th other than to confirm for you that there are likely to be some. And whenever those transfers take place, once they have been completed, we announce them publicly. And that will continue to be our approach through January 20th. And my expectation is that there will be some additional announcements of that type.\nWith regard to this question about --\nQ: Including this week, you think?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Including this week, you think?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to timing at this point. But certainly before January 20th.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: With regard to this question about reengagement, you'll recall that President Obama, upon taking office in 2009, ordered a comprehensive review of the file of every single detainee at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And the purpose of that review was to determine whether or not individuals under an appropriate set of security requirements could be safely transferred to another country in a way that would not undermine U.S. national security. And the process that he established required a variety of agencies, including the Secretary of Defense, to certify that the appropriate security requirements were in place before an individual was transferred.\nThis careful, specific approach was a departure from the approach that was taken by the previous administration, and it shows in the results. The percentage of those who have been confirmed of reengaging in the fight by the intelligence community -- these are individual who were released or transferred from Guantanamo before 2009, before President Obama took office -- is 21 percent. Twenty-one percent of the Gitmo detainees who were released before President Obama took office have been confirmed by our intelligence agency of reengaging in the fight.\nSince President Obama took office, and since these reforms were initiated, nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight. Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obama's time in office, a little back-of-the-envelope math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and it's a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office.\nQ: Does that include now-deceased combatants?\nMR. EARNEST: We can check on the details for you on that.\nQ: Okay. Lastly, Tuesday we were talking about the President and the economy and having created 900,000 manufacturing jobs. We're doing some number-crunching and it seems to be a little bit higher than that which we've come up with. Can you sort of help me square the difference? I think we came at around 807,000 or something.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I said was nearly 900,000. I did overshoot the mark a little bit. I was just working off of memory, I didn't have the numbers in front of me.\nQ: Okay, great.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Just on this -- to follow Kevin's question about this review and briefing the President is getting, I don't understand what's new or what's being learned or what was asked that moves the whole situation past what you knew to order sanctions and the removal diplomats to where we are today. What questions are now answered? And what's new, or what's the President learning about that he didn't know then but already felt confident enough that he should make these moves?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of parts to this, Ron. The first fact is that this report is, despite all the attention that is understandably focused on the review of Russian involvement and Russia's malicious cyber activity in the context of the 2016 election, this review will take a look at malicious cyber activity in previous presidential elections, as well, including by actors other than Russia. So it's a little bit broader than just this one incident.\nThe second thing is, the last time that we heard formally from the intelligence community on this matter was the first week in October. And since that time, the intelligence community has dedicated significant resources to learning as much as they possibly could about the Russian malicious cyber activity and the efforts that they undertook to undermine or raise questions about the durability of the American democracy. So that's the material that they're reviewing and including in the report.\nI can't say at this point exactly what that means for the content, because I haven't seen the content.\nQ: And you described a process kind of underway of briefing there. Who exactly is briefing the President? How many Cabinet secretaries are involved?\nMR. EARNEST: It's members of his national security team, including some of the individuals who testified on Capitol Hill today. It essentially is senior officials who are responsible for compiling the report.\nQ: So we're talking about a half dozen or more people?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's more than that, but I don't have a specific manifest from the meeting to share.\nQ: And Director Clapper talked about the motive and intent of it on the Hill, and he said that there was more than one motive. Does this review answer the question of whether the Russians intended to or were motivated to try to make Donald Trump or help him become President?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the contents of the report because I just haven't seen it.\nQ: But you can tell without seeing it. Going into this process, or as this process was ongoing, was that one of the questions that was going to be answered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I would leave it to the intelligence community to say what they're going to include in the report. And I think this will be easier to discuss then.\nBut look, as I said last month at some length, you don't need a security clearance to know the impact that this Russian hack-and-leak strategy had on the campaign. Again, it was the DNC whose emails were hacked and released, not the RNC's. It was John Podesta's emails that were hacked and released, not Reince Priebus. It was the Trump campaign that had positive things to say about President Putin's leadership. And it was the Trump campaign that raised questions about their ongoing commitment to NATO.\nQ: But then why won't you say the Russians tried to get Donald Trump elected?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, because we're going to wait on an intelligence community assessment. But again, I think that there's certainly some common sense that can be applied that doesn't require a security clearance.\nQ: And in talking about this, you always use the term \"high confidence.\" Is there something higher than high confidence? Is there like highest confidence or most highest? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: The oldest confidence or something?\nQ: This could actually be like a fairly low standard high confidence, that there's like ultimate and -- I hate to be --\nMR. EARNEST: It's okay. You should probably direct this question to an expert in the intelligence community. What I can assure you is it's not a low standard. It is, as the name suggests, an extraordinarily high standard. It is not an --\nQ: -- been something higher?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is not uncommon for the President and other decision-makers to get analysis from the intelligence community that is a low confidence or a moderate confidence assessment. That's not unusual. That is an effort by the intelligence community to provide as much information and as much analysis as possible. So the fact that these are conclusions that have been reached with high confidence is an indication of their high confidence in this information.\nQ: Clapper said it was not a close call, this wasn't tough to figure out. Is that true?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think the best way to interpret this is to consider the extraordinary nature of the statement that was issued by the intelligence community before the election. That is not something that's happened before. That's unprecedented. And the fact that they were not just able, but willing, to make such a forceful statement, on the record, in advance of the election, I think is telling.\nQ: And lastly, completely different subject. What are the President and First Lady doing tomorrow night, Friday night?\nMR. EARNEST: There have been some reports about the President and First Lady hosting a social event here at the White House, and that's something that they've done in the past and it's something I anticipate they're going to do again tomorrow.\nQ: Anything more about it? Are you going?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any details about who's attending, and I'll get back to you about my own personal plans for Friday night. I don't know if that's an invitation or -- (laughter) -- I'm just teasing.\nQ: This is a farewell party, essentially.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, over the years the President and First Lady have on occasion, not frequently, but on occasion have hosted parties at the White House for their friends. And I anticipate this will be the last one that they have. They've got some packing to do.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about a resolution that's being voted on in the House this afternoon on the U.N. Security Council Resolution on Israeli Settlement Activity. It condemns the resolution and it calls for its repeal. I'm wondering if the White House has seen that resolution and what, if any, reaction you have to it.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm aware of the resolution. Obviously, it is not at all something that the Obama administration agrees with. The action that was taken by the Obama administration a couple of weeks ago at the United Nations Security Council reflected the President's consideration of America's foremost national security interests. It reflected a careful considering of the policy that the United States has pursued under Presidents in both parties, which is the need for a two-state solution to resolve the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians in the region. And the United States declined to veto a resolution that expressed concern about the accelerated pace of Israeli settlement construction and, notably, the continued violence and incitement that we've seen in that context of that conflict.\nBoth of those things are making it harder for both sides to come together around a two-state solution. And, in fact, both of them -- both of those actions are actually putting a two-state solution even further out of reach. And the administration is deeply concerned about that. The United States has long articulated our commitment to a secure, democratic Jewish Israel living side by side in peace and security with a contiguous, viable Palestinian state. And outside of that solution is only a single state that would force the Israeli government and the Israeli people to choose between being Jewish and democratic because -- given the size of the large Palestinian population in that area.\nSo this is something that -- the trend lines are not good. And that's why the Obama administration took, admittedly, a notable step, but a step that is entirely consistent with the long-held bipartisan policy of the United States of America.\nQ: And on another topic. There are a number of House Democrats who have decided to boycott the inauguration activities to protest President-elect Trump. Obviously, the President is going to participate in them, and he's talked about the need for a smooth transition. Does the White House have any view on whether it's appropriate for these members to sit on the sidelines and protest the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any view that the President has expressed. I think the President's view is that members of Congress can attend the inauguration if they'd like, and if they don't want to then I think that's probably fine too.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, what is the President's thinking in submitting, or resubmitting, 10 nominations to the Senate yesterday -- several inspectors general, as I recall?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is just fulfilling his presidential responsibility to continue ensuring that the federal government is fully staffed and the individuals, the men and women that President Obama has put forward, are individuals with the highest degree of integrity. These are accomplished professionals who are more than qualified for these positions. We've been disappointed that we haven't seen the Republican Congress act as expeditiously as they should have to confirm and, in some cases, even consider some of the President's nominees. We'll have to see what the congressional response to these nominees is, but obviously there's a short window for them to act.\nQ: Very short.\nMR. EARNEST: Indeed.\nQ: Does President Obama have any expectation that this GOP Senate will act on these nominations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have seen a lot of Republican senators talk about how important it is for highly qualified inspectors general to be in place. So we certainly -- if that's what they actually believe, then these individuals should be given due consideration.\nQ: Are these the last of his nominations?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't rule out at this point additional nominations, but we'll obviously let you know.\nQ: I also wanted to ask whether there was any consideration given to sneaking in a recess appointment during the five-minute intersession recess on Monday.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that there was -- at least not seriously. I guess I can't speak to what everybody might have been considering. (Laughter.) But I'm not aware of any serious consideration to doing that.\nQ: Have you seen the article written by Mike McCurry and Ari Fleischer with recommendations to the Trump press operation? One of the things they're recommending is no more live TV coverage of White House briefings and rotating in reporters into the seats in the briefing room. Does that sound like something you could endorse?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't think I would endorse either of those things, but they're certainly provocative ideas and they're not things that I would instinctively oppose either.\nI think -- you know, what I've said publicly about this process is that it's a valuable one, and that there's a lot of symbolic value to a senior member of the President's team being held accountable, and for that accountability to play out on camera and on the record. I think that's a good thing for our democracy and the President has actually found that to be a useful thing for his presidency.\nBut look, this is an exercise that presidential press secretaries have engaged in for a couple generations now, and this venue and this process has evolved over time and it's not automatically a bad thing if there are some innovations that can be introduced that would make this kind of exchange more fruitful and even more in line with the purpose of giving all of you an opportunity to demand some transparency and accountability.\nBut it's hard to imagine that there's anything you could do to make the briefing more entertaining than it's been over the last couple years. (Laughter.) I say that facetiously.\nWe'll do a couple more. Jared.\nQ: Josh, what's your message to voters who find the argument compelling -- this argument pushed out by the President-elect and certainly many of his supporters -- that intelligence community reports are not to be trusted because of alleged failures of intelligence community reports in the past?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- my message to voters is that the elections are quite a ways away. So the message --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: My message to citizens though -- that's what I was just going to say. My message to citizens is a couple of things.\nThe first is, there have been serious reforms that have been put in place since the high-profile intelligence failures around 9/11, and those reforms have addressed a range of bureaucratic inefficiencies that prevented some decision-makers from getting timely, accurate information. And there should be motivation internally -- in the U.S. government, in the intelligence community, and in the White House -- to look for ways to continue to strengthen the kind of -- to strengthen the process by which the President and his team receive up-to-date, accurate information.\nWhat I can tell you is that over the last eight years, President Obama has been extraordinarily well served by the timely and accurate advice that he has received from the intelligence community. And so that's been a good thing both in terms of the structure that's been in place, but also in terms of the people who have filled the boxes in that organizational chart.\nQ: Just one follow-up on Isaac's question about former Congressman Perriello. The President -- you've described and he's described with a lot of enthusiasm for the prospect of the Affordable Care Act moving forward. Does that enthusiasm for the ACA, which obviously was a big part of the 2010 vote that took Congressman Perriello out of office -- does that enthusiasm for Obamacare's future translate to enthusiasm for Perriello or for a Democrat's chances in 2017 in the gubernatorial race in Virginia?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think I already have made the observation that if Republicans follow through on their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away health care for 30 million Americans, and strip the kinds of protections that prevent 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions from being discriminated against, that doesn't sound like very good politics to me. But I think it's far too early to tell what sort of impact that could have on, for example, the Virginia governor's race.\nI do know that there is a unanimity of opinion among Democrats in Virginia about how important it is to expand Medicaid in Virginia. And the Republican obstruction that we have seen that has prevented thousands of people in the Commonwealth of Virginia from getting access to health care, I don't think that's going to be a political winner for them either. But I'll let the individual Democratic candidates speak to their position on that.\nQ: One last one. This is about the DNC race. The Mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, has entered that race. Does the President know this mayor? Does he have a relationship with him? And this has developed during the briefing today, so I don't expect it if you don't have anything today.\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that the President has had an opportunity to meet him, and the President believes that he is obviously a young man with a very compelling story. He's already quite accomplished. But I'm not aware that the President -- as I mentioned earlier, I'm not aware the President intends to formally endorse in the race, but we'll have to see what happens.\nFrancesca, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks. Coincidentally, I also have a question about the Democratic National Committee race. You just said that the President doesn't intend to formally or publicly endorse anyone, but has he privately endorsed anyone? (Laughter.) And has he --- no --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it wouldn't be private if I said it here. (Laughter.)\nQ: No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just saying, has he privately endorsed anyone, and has he potentially encouraged anyone to join the race?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm not going to -- you know, obviously there are now at least a couple of people that are in the race that the President knows personally. The President obviously thinks very highly of a number of the people that have thrown their hat into the ring.\nThe thing that I can tell you is that the President does believe that having a vigorous contest for a position like this is good for the party because this is the kind of decision that's not made by party insiders in Washington, this is -- the chairman of the DNC is elected by votes cast by DNC members all across the country. And so having a vigorous debate in our party about who should be the leader of the party and what sort of approach that person should take to strengthening our party and making sure that Democrats are doing what the President suggested in terms of being more present and more effective advocates in communities all across the country for the kinds of values that our party stands for.\nBut ultimately, who will be entrusted with that responsibility is a decision that will be made by the men and women of the Democratic National Committee, and their membership extends to communities all across the country.\nQ: And a quick follow-up on one other thing. So it is possible, then, that he encouraged someone behind the scenes to get into the race?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to talk about the conversations that the President has. There are a number of people that the President respects, admires, and even likes who are in the race. And having a surplus of experienced, qualified, charismatic candidates is only a good thing for the Democratic Party, and the President is pleased by that.\nQ: Sure. And then the last thing, we discussed earlier this week possible details on the speech in Chicago. Anything else to share about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Come back tomorrow and we'll do that, okay?\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: All right. Thanks, everybody. We'll see you then.\nEND 2:49 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123061", "text": "Since the beginning of this Administration, the President and Vice President have made it a priority to root out sexual misconduct wherever it exists, especially on our nation's college campuses. Students have played a significant role in carrying out the Administration's vision for having educational institutions that are free from violence. Around the country, college women and men are taking active roles in ensuring that their schools have robust and comprehensive plans to better understand and prevent sexual misconduct.\nToday, the White House is proud to host its final event focused on stopping sexual violence against students, the It's On Us Summit. The Summit will bring together student leaders, campus, community, business and media partners, and federal colleagues. Attendees have gathered from across the country to hear from members of the Administration and outside stakeholders about the work that is being done to address campus sexual assault and to engage in a dialogue about the future of this work, both on college campuses and in communities across the country.\nThe White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault Presents its Final Report\nIn April 2011, Vice President Biden and the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, introduced comprehensive guidance to help colleges and universities better understand their obligations under federal civil rights laws to prevent and respond to sexual assault on campus. Building on those efforts, in January 2014, the President and Vice President established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault (Task Force). The Task Force, co-chaired by the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls, has since worked diligently to assist schools in addressing campus sexual assault.\nIn collaboration with Federal partners, the Task Force has produced a number of practical tools that are readily available to students, administrators, faculty, campus police, health care professionals, and others who play key roles in these efforts. Today, the White House will release The Second Report of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. This second and final report builds on the recommendations and lessons learned from the first report of the Task Force, Not Alone, released in 2014, and documents the advances that have been made throughout this Administration to address sexual misconduct in higher education. It also highlights some of the innovative and forward thinking initiatives that have been undertaken by campuses around the Nation.\nIn conjunction with the report, today the White House will also release Preventing and Addressing Campus Sexual Misconduct: A Guide for University and College Presidents, Chancellors, and Senior Administrators (Guide).The Guide serves as a foundation for campus leadership to develop, or further hone, comprehensive responses to sexual misconduct at their institutions. Through its final report and the Guide, the Task Force underscores the importance of university leadership sending a strong public message of support for these responses — and the faculty, staff, and students who help develop them — and championing a culture shift that promotes safe campuses that are free from sexual misconduct.\nFor a full list of products, tools, and research findings on campus sexual assault produced during the Obama Administration, click here.\nIt's On Us\nAfter scores of listening sessions with students across the country, the President and Vice President launched It's On Us in September of 2014.\nIt's On Us is a movement aimed at fundamentally shifting the culture around sexual assault. It's a rallying cry, inviting everyone to step up and realize that the solution begins with all of us. The campaign works to educate, engage, and empower students and communities across the country to do something, big or small, to end sexual assault. The campaign has three core pillars - consent education, increasing bystander intervention, and creating an environment that supports survivors. Over the past two years, almost 400,000 people have taken the It's On Us pledge online and students have hosted almost 2,000 events on over 500 college campuses nationwide. The campaign has 95 partners, including MTV, Snapchat, and Major League Baseball.\nThe Vice President has traveled to numerous college campuses to talk with students about the responsibility we all share to step in and prevent sexual assault when we see it happening. As a lifelong champion for ending violence against women, he has shared this message of engagement and support for survivors with diverse audiences, including at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles in March 2016, and the NCAA Final Four Tournament in Houston in March 2016.\nThis year, It's On Us launched several new programs including a nationwide Student Engagement Program structured into eight Regional Teams of student leaders. This spring, each Team will host a Regional Summit to build upon the work of the campaign over the past two years. These Regional Summits will bring together students, advocates, community leaders, and campus administrators on the local level to focus on coordinated prevention strategies and messaging. Through this series of local summits, It's On Us will train and educate over 800 leaders on consent, bystander intervention, and creating an environment that supports survivors.\nAdditionally, It's On Us recently launched two new programs: a Greek Leadership Council comprised of fraternity and sorority leadership, and a Campus Innovation Program to partner directly with college and university administrators. Over the next year, It's On Us will continue to grow these programs, as well as launch new initiatives and critical partnerships focused on engaging the athletic and entertainment communities.\nBecause of the dedicated student advocates and the leadership of our partners, we are confident that the work to prevent and respond to sexual assault on campuses and in communities across the country will continue. Join our effort by taking the pledge at ItsOnUs.org.\nIf you or someone you know is in need of support, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673, or  visit here to chat live.", "timestamp": "2017-01-05", "title": "Fact Sheet: Final It's On Us Summit and Report of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120781", "text": "Today, First Lady Michelle Obama will host 50 school counselors at the White House for the 2017 Counselor of the Year Ceremony. Recognizing the efforts of school counselors is one of many ways in which the First Lady has worked to change the national conversation and make sure students have the guidance they deserve. Through her Reach Higher initiative and  Better Make Room campaign, Mrs. Obama has teamed up with actors, singers, and sports icons to celebrate students and share tools and resources, such as the FAFSA, College Scorecard, and Up Next, with students.\nAmerica built a strong middle class over the past several generations through a commitment to keeping a high-quality education within reach of all who are willing to work for it. In keeping this promise alive, President Obama has made the largest investment in student aid since the G.I. Bill, and implemented reforms to ensure every student can earn a good-value college degree or credential. Today, many historically underserved students are enrolling in college for the first time; more students are graduating from college than ever; and new student loan defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are on the decline. We can continue building on the progress, which includes:\n•     Breaking Records on High School Graduation Rates: The high school graduation rate has risen steadily over President Obama’s time in office, growing by about four percentage points since the 2010-2011 school year – the first year all states used a consistent, four-year adjusted measure of high school completion. This increase reflects important progress schools across the country are making to better prepare students for college and careers after graduation. In October 2016, President Obama announced that America’s high school graduation rate reached a record new high of 83.2 percent.\n•     Redesigning America’s High Schools: To engage, prepare, and inspire college and career-ready students, and align high school learning to the experiences and opportunities that matter in young people’s lives President Obama laid out a new vision for America’s high schools in his 2013 State of the Union address, proposing funding to scale-up innovative high school models and partnerships with colleges and employers so that all students graduate better equipped for the demands of the innovation economy. To build on this work the White House has hosted two annual summits on Next Generation High Schools in 2015 and 2016, announcing $375 million in private and public sector commitments and commitments from states and school districts estimated to impact more than 600,000 students to advance Next Generation High Schools.\n•     Making It Easier to Access the Historic Investments in Financial Aid: President Obama has doubled investments in financial aid, increasing the maximum Pell Grant by over $1,000 and establishing the American Opportunity Tax Credit to provide up to $10,000 in tax credits to support higher education over four years. More than two million additional students have received college assistance each year through the Pell Grant over the course of the Obama Administration. A recent report by the President’s Council of Economic Advisers suggests that the Obama Administration’s increase in the average Pell Award between 2008-2009 and 2014-2015 will lead to an additional $20 billion in aggregate earnings, a nearly 2:1 return on the investment. , the White House and U.S. Department of Education are launching this year’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)—available October 1st for the first time, three months earlier than the traditional January 1st date—so that more students can access the historic investment in financial aid and better information when they need it. In the first month alone, the number of FAFSAs completed outpaced the previous years’ by over 10 percent, and has increased for Pell-eligible and first-generation students.\n•     Promoting College Success: The College Scorecard—which was announced by the President in 2015—provides the clearest, most comprehensive national data on cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings. Organizations—like Google, College Board, and the Common Application—are building the College Scorecard tool and data into their products in order to ensure that students and families have the best information available at critical decision-making-periods. The College Scorecard data on college costs, graduation rates, and earnings will be clearly featured in the hundreds of millions of Google searches related to colleges and universities taking place in the U.S. each year. Together with the earlier availability of the FAFSA, the College Scorecard ensures that students and families have the best information available to choose a good-value school. Because students and families can learn about their financial aid eligibility within a few days of completing the FAFSA, they will have better information to compare costs and student outcomes available on the Scorecard when they are searching for and applying to schools. Next year, the FAFSA will direct students to the College Scorecard, so that students will have immediate access to the information they need to make their most consequential investment to date—by weighing their personalized financial aid estimates against a school’s student outcomes, comparing schools, and considering the full scope of their college options.\n•     Making Community College Free for Hard-working Students: During his 2015 State of the Union, President Obama unveiled America’s College Promise (ACP), a plan that creates and strengthens partnerships to make two years of community college free for responsible students, letting students earn the first half of a college degree and skills needed in the workforce at no cost. The President’s proposal would also support four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions in providing students with up to two years of college at zero or significantly reduced tuition. If all states participate, an estimated nine million students could benefit. A full-time community college student could save an average of $3,800 in tuition per year. Over 100 new free community college programs have been established in states, cities, systems, and schools across the country since the President announced ACP in his 2015 State of the Union. Altogether, they are raising and investing $338 million in new dollars to serve 210,000 students. The number of free community college programs across the country is expected to grow, with $100 million for America’s Promise Grants, the tuition-free dual enrollment pilot for 10,000 students, and resources like the America’s College Promise Playbook.\n•     Making Progress on Commitments to Share Information about FAFSA and the College Scorecard: Using platforms like the Up Next texting tool, students can access step-by-step advice and personalized support on completing the FAFSA, explore the College Scorecard, and complete their college entrance exams. In response to the Administration’s call to action, numerous organizations have made commitments to ensure more students are connected to information about college preparation. Recent progress on these commitments includes:\n•     Increased Outreach to Underserved High Schools: The Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success member colleges and universities completed 554 high school visits to 270 high schools where students are most likely to benefit from college information and resources this fall – with Texas A&M University leading the way with 63 school visits. In preparation for visiting these and other under-resourced schools with high populations of lower income students, several colleges collaborated to create a series of communications to connect students with Up Next mobile text messaging campaign and introducing students to the FAFSA toolkit and College Scorecard. Member institutions also encouraged students to make use of free tools available as part of the Coalition platform, including college entrance exam preparation and other college search tools.\n•     Sharing Best Practices Across the Country. Partnering with school counselors and education leaders in 42 states including the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, in just over two years Reach Higher’s growing coalition of school counselors has organized five national school counseling convenings, 2 regional convenings and 2 statewide convenings bringing education stakeholders from across the country together to discuss and share promising practices and strategies to help guide our nation’s students to reach their fullest potential. These states have responded to the First Lady’s call to action and have made a pledge to continue in this effort beyond the administration through the commitments they have made to increase postsecondary access and success outcomes. More on Reach Higher’s work with school counselors can be found in Reach Higher’s Progress Report.\n•     Signing Day Bonuses. DonorsChoose.org, a crowdfunding nonprofit that's helped public school teachers raise $500 million for classroom projects, and the College Football Playoff Foundation, a nonprofit committed to supporting education across the country, are continuing to organize this spring’s 1,000 College Signing Day events, started by Reach Higher and Better Make Room. When counselors at public schools’ nationwide register to host a College Signing Day at their high school campus, they will receive $500 in DonorsChoose.org funding credits, backed by the College Football Playoff Foundation, to help fund classroom resources for their event. These $500 \"signing bonuses\" will help ensure counselors have the materials they need to launch successful College Signing Day events.", "timestamp": "2017-01-06", "title": "Fact Sheet: First Lady Michelle Obama Hosts School Counselor of the Year and Marks Education Progress"}

You guys, that's a command -- rest yourselves. (Laughter.) We're almost at the end. (Laughter.)\nHello, everyone. And, may I say for the last time officially, welcome to the White House. Yes! (Applause.) Well, we are beyond thrilled to have you all here to celebrate the 2017 National School Counselor of the Year, as well as all of our State Counselors of the Year. These are the fine women, and a few good men -- (laughter) -- one good man -- who are on this stage, and they represent schools from across this country.\nAnd I want to start by thanking Terri for that wonderful introduction and her right-on-the-spot remarks. I'm going to say a lot more about Terri in a few minutes, but first I want to take a moment to acknowledge a few people who are here.\nFirst, our outstanding Secretary of Education, John King. (Applause.) As well as our former Education Secretary, Arne Duncan. (Applause.) I want to take this time to thank you both publicly for your dedication and leadership and friendship. We couldn't do this without the support of the Department of Education under both of your leadership. So I'm grateful to you personally, and very proud of all that you've done for this country.\nI also want to acknowledge a few other special guests we have in the audience. We've got a pretty awesome crew. As one of my staff said, \"You roll pretty deep.\" (Laughter.) I'm like, well, yeah, we have a few good friends. We have with us today Ted Allen, La La Anthony, Connie Britton, Andy Cohen -- yeah, Andy Cohen is here -- (laughter) -- Carla Hall, Coach Jim Harbaugh and his beautiful wife, who's a lot better looking than him -- (laughter) -- Lana Parrilla, my buddy Jay Pharoah, Kelly Rowland, Usher --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo!\nMRS. OBAMA: Keep it down. (Laughter.) Keep it together, ladies. Wale is here. And of course, Allison Williams and her mom are here.\nAnd all these folks are here because they're using their star power to inspire our young people. And I'm so grateful to all of you for stepping up in so many ways on so many occasions. I feel like I've pestered you over these years, asking time and time again, \"Well, where are you going to be?\" \"I'm going to be in New York.\" \"Can you come? Can you come here? Can you do this? Can you take that? Can you ask for that? Can you come? Can we rap? Can we sing?\" (Laughter.) So thank you all so much. It really means the world to this initiative to have such powerful, respected and admired individuals speaking on behalf of this issue. So congratulations on the work that you've done, and we're going to keep working.\nAnd today, I especially want to recognize all these -- extraordinary leadership team that was behind Reach Higher from day one. And this isn't on the script so they don't know this. I want to take time to personally acknowledge a couple of people. Executive Director Eric Waldo. (Applause.) Where is Eric? He's in the -- you've got to step out. (Applause.) Eric is acting like he's a ham, but he likes the spotlight. (Laughter.) He's acting a little shy.\nI want to recognize our Deputy Director, Stephanie Sprow. Stephanie. (Applause.) And he's really not going to like this because he tries to pretend like he doesn't exist at all, but our Senior Advisor, Greg Darnieder. (Applause.) There you go. Greg has been a leader in education his entire life. I've known him since I was a little organizer person. And it's just been just a joy to work with you all. These individuals, they are brilliant. They are creative. They have worked miracles with hardly any staff or budget to speak of -- which is how we roll in the First Lady's Office. (Laughter.) And I am so proud and so, so grateful to you all for everything that you've done. So let's give them a round of applause. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, I want to recognize all of you who are here in this audience. We have our educators, our leaders, our young people who have been with us since we launched Reach Higher back in 2014. Now, when we first came up with this idea, we had one clear goal in mind: We wanted to make higher education cool. We wanted to change the conversation around what it means and what it takes to be a success in this country. Because let's be honest, if we're always shining the spotlight on professional athletes or recording artists or Hollywood celebrities, if those are the only achievements we celebrate, then why would we ever think kids would see college as a priority?\nSo we decided to flip the script and shine a big, bright spotlight on all things educational. For example, we made College Signing Day a national event. We wanted to mimic all the drama and excitement traditionally reserved for those few amazing football and basketball players choosing their college and university teams. We wanted to focus that same level of energy and attention on kids going to college because of their academic achievements. Because as a nation, that's where the spotlight should also be –- on kids who work hard in school and do the right thing when no one is watching, many beating daunting odds.\nNext, we launched Better Make Room. It's a social media campaign to give young people the support and inspiration they need to actually complete higher education. And to really drive that message home, you may recall that I debuted my music career -- (laughter) -- rapping with Jay about getting some knowledge by going to college. (Laughter and applause.)\nWe are also very proud of all that this administration has done to make higher education more affordable. We doubled investments in Pell grants and college tax credits. We expanded income-based loan repayment options for tens of millions of students. We made it easier to apply for financial aid. We created a College Scorecard to help students make good decisions about higher education. And we provided new funding and support for school counselors. (Applause.) Altogether, we made in this administration the largest investment in higher education since the G.I. Bill. (Applause.) And today, the high school graduation rate is at a record high, and more young people than ever before are going to college.\nAnd we know that school counselors like all of the folks standing with me on this stage have played a critical role in helping us get there. In fact, a recent study showed that students who met with a school counselor to talk about financial aid or college were three times more likely to attend college, and they were nearly seven times more likely to apply for financial aid.\nSo our school counselors are truly among the heroes of the Reach Higher story. And that's why we created this event two years ago, because we thought that they should finally get some recognition. (Applause.) We wanted everyone to know about the difference that these phenomenal men and women have been making in the lives of our young people every day. And our 2017 School Counselor of the Year, Terri Tchorzynski, is a perfect example.\nAs you heard, Terri works at the Calhoun Area Career Center, a career and technical education school in Michigan. And here's what Terri's principal said about her in his letter of recommendation. He said, \"Once she identifies a systemic need, she works tirelessly to address it.\"\nSo when students at Terri's school reported feeling unprepared to apply for higher education, Terri sprang into action to create a school-wide, top-to-bottom college-readiness effort. Under Terri's leadership, more students than ever before attended workshops on resume writing, FAFSA completion -- yes, I can now say FAFSA -- (laughter) -- and interview preparation. I can barely say it. (Laughter.) They did career and personal -- personality assessments. They helped plan a special college week. And they organized a Military Day, hosting recruiters from all branches of our armed forces. And because of these efforts, today, 75 percent of Calhoun's seniors now complete key college application steps, and Terri's school has won state and national recognition.\nAnd all of this is just one small part of what Terri does for her students each day. I can go on and on about all the time she spends one-on-one with students, helping them figure out their life path. Terri told us -- as you heard, she told us about one of those students, so we reached out to Kyra. And here's what Kyra had to say in her own words. Kyra wrote that \"Mrs. Tchorzynski has helped me grow to love myself. She helped me with my doubts and insecurities.\" She said, my life has changed \"for the better in all aspects.\" Kyra said, \"She held my hand through my hardest times.\" She said, \"Mrs. Tchorzynski is my lifesaver.\" That's what Kyra said. (Laughter.)\nAnd this is what each of you do every single day. You see the promise in each of your students. You believe in them even when they can't believe in themselves, and you work tirelessly to help them be who they were truly meant to be. And you do it all in the face of some overwhelming challenges –- tight budgets, impossible student-counselor ratios -- yeah, amen -- (laughter) -- endless demands on your time.\nYou all come in early, you stay late. You reach into your own pockets -- and see, we've got the amen corner. (Laughter.) You stick with students in their darkest moments, when they're most anxious and afraid. And if anyone is dealing with a college [high school] senior or junior, you know what this feels like. These men and women show them that those kids matter; that they have something to offer; that no matter where they're from or how much money their parents have, no matter what they look like or who they love or how they worship or what language they speak at home, they have a place in this country.\nAnd as I end my time in the White House, I can think of no better message to send our young people in my last official remarks as First Lady. So for all the young people in this room and those who are watching, know that this country belongs to you –- to all of you, from every background and walk of life. If you or your parents are immigrants, know that you are part of a proud American tradition –- the infusion of new cultures, talents and ideas, generation after generation, that has made us the greatest country on earth.\nIf your family doesn't have much money, I want you to remember that in this country, plenty of folks, including me and my husband –- we started out with very little. But with a lot of hard work and a good education, anything is possible -- even becoming President. That's what the American Dream is all about. (Applause.)\nIf you are a person of faith, know that religious diversity is a great American tradition, too. In fact, that's why people first came to this country –- to worship freely. And whether you are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh -- these religions are teaching our young people about justice, and compassion, and honesty. So I want our young people to continue to learn and practice those values with pride. You see, our glorious diversity -- our diversities of faiths and colors and creeds -- that is not a threat to who we are, it makes us who we are. (Applause.) So the young people here and the young people out there: Do not ever let anyone make you feel like you don't matter, or like you don't have a place in our American story -- because you do. And you have a right to be exactly who you are.\nBut I also want to be very clear: This right isn't just handed to you. No, this right has to be earned every single day. You cannot take your freedoms for granted. Just like generations who have come before you, you have to do your part to preserve and protect those freedoms. And that starts right now, when you're young.\nRight now, you need to be preparing yourself to add your voice to our national conversation. You need to prepare yourself to be informed and engaged as a citizen, to serve and to lead, to stand up for our proud American values and to honor them in your daily lives. And that means getting the best education possible so you can think critically, so you can express yourself clearly, so you can get a good job and support yourself and your family, so you can be a positive force in your communities.\nAnd when you encounter obstacles -- because I guarantee you, you will, and many of you already have -- when you are struggling and you start thinking about giving up, I want you to remember something that my husband and I have talked about since we first started this journey nearly a decade ago, something that has carried us through every moment in this White House and every moment of our lives, and that is the power of hope -- the belief that something better is always possible if you're willing to work for it and fight for it.\nIt is our fundamental belief in the power of hope that has allowed us to rise above the voices of doubt and division, of anger and fear that we have faced in our own lives and in the life of this country. Our hope that if we work hard enough and believe in ourselves, then we can be whatever we dream, regardless of the limitations that others may place on us. The hope that when people see us for who we truly are, maybe, just maybe they, too, will be inspired to rise to their best possible selves.\nThat is the hope of students like Kyra who fight to discover their gifts and share them with the world. It's the hope of school counselors like Terri and all these folks up here who guide those students every step of the way, refusing to give up on even a single young person. Shoot, it's the hope of my -- folks like my dad who got up every day to do his job at the city water plant; the hope that one day, his kids would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed of.\nThat's the kind of hope that every single one of us -– politicians, parents, preachers –- all of us need to be providing for our young people. Because that is what moves this country forward every single day -– our hope for the future and the hard work that hope inspires.\nSo that's my final message to young people as First Lady. It is simple. (Applause.) I want our young people to know that they matter, that they belong. So don't be afraid –- you hear me, young people? Don't be afraid. Be focused. Be determined. Be hopeful. Be empowered. Empower yourselves with a good education, then get out there and use that education to build a country worthy of your boundless promise. Lead by example with hope, never fear. And know that I will be with you, rooting for you and working to support you for the rest of my life.\nAnd that is true I know for every person who are here -- is here today, and for educators and advocates all across this nation who get up every day and work their hearts out to lift up our young people. And I am so grateful to all of you for your passion and your dedication and all the hard work on behalf of our next generation. And I can think of no better way to end my time as First Lady than celebrating with all of you.\nSo I want to close today by simply saying thank you. Thank you for everything you do for our kids and for our country. Being your First Lady has been the greatest honor of my life, and I hope I've made you proud.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120995", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:55 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Happy Friday, everybody. Nice to see you all. Before we get started, as you might judge from the monitors behind, we got a couple things we want to do at the top before we get started.\nAs all of you saw this morning, today the final monthly jobs report of the Obama administration was released, and I want to go over a couple of the highlights here.\nLike many of you, I've spent the first Friday morning of each month of the last eight years anticipating the monthly jobs data. At the beginning of the administration, the earliest days of this presidency, the day that was in the minds of many people down right terrifying, our economy was losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month and the unemployment rate was climbing sharply. Eight years later, driven by the policies this administration put in place and the resilience of the American workforce, the data looks quite different and the numbers tell a very different story about the health of our economy.\nIn December, the U.S. economy added a 156,000 jobs, extending the longest streak of total job growth in our nation's history. U.S. businesses have now added 15.8 million jobs over the course of the economic recovery. Wages are continuing to rise, and the unemployment rate continues to be less than half of what it was during the peak of the recession.\nOver the eight years that President Obama has been in office, you all have held us to an extraordinarily high standard when it comes to the economic recovery, and we're proud of the progress that America has made. This progress shows that policy matters. Without the policies the President fought for, it would not have been possible. And so I recount the facts today, because acknowledging how far we have come as a country is an important part of understanding what's needed to create an economy that provides good job opportunities and generates higher wages for all Americans who are willing to work for them.\nThe President-elect, of course, has promised a different approach. His approach includes rolling back regulations that have protected middle-class families from having to foot the bill for Wall Street's risky behavior. His approach includes leveling high tariffs on foreign goods that drive up costs for consumers in the United States and put at risk higher-paying U.S. jobs that are tied to exports. And, of course, he's also vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would add trillions to the deficit.\nAs you evaluate the impact of the President-elect's policies over the coming years, here are some metrics that should be used to evaluate the approach that we have taken and compare it to the approach that's been pursued by the other side. Since job growth turned positive in October of 2012, the U.S. economy has added jobs for 75 straight months. This is, as I referred to earlier, the longest streak of job growth on record, and it's actually more than two years longer than the previous record. So this is quite a streak, and we'll see if it continues.\nIn 2016, hourly wages increased 2.9 percent. That's the fastest 12-month pace since the start of the recovery. Real hourly wages have grown faster over the current business cycle than in any business cycle since the early 1970s. Wages are obviously a metric that this administration has watched closely, and we're pleased to see that wage growth is accelerating and has accelerated over the President's tenure in office.\nThe third metric -- the unemployment rate has been cut by more than half since its peak of 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in December of this year. As recently as 2014, just a couple of years ago, many economists expected the unemployment rate to remain above 5 percent until at least 2020. So we've repeatedly beaten the predictions about driving down the unemployment rate.\nFourth, since 2010, the United States has put more people back to work than all the other G7 economies combined. That is a strong validation of the economic strategy that President Obama pursued. It does stand in contrast to the economic strategy that was pursued by some of our closest allies, but the results speak for themselves and it's why we regularly describe the U.S. economy as the envy of the world.\nFinally -- and I don't have a chart for this -- we can also cite a metric that we know is one that is certainly closely watched by the incoming President's economic team. That's the stock market. And the S&P has more than tripled since the lows that it reached in March of 2009 within President Obama's first couple of months in office. So we certainly set a high bar. It's a bar that we are proud of, and it's one that the incoming administration will be challenged to meet.\nOne other piece of news I want to share briefly this morning before we get started is, today is the last day for Pete Boogaard in the White House Press Office. So Pete has served in the White House for a little over a year now, and has served with distinction. But, notably, Pete spent a lot of time working in other critically important agencies of the Obama administration, including at the Department of Homeland Security. And he is somebody who has time and again showed a lot of cool under fire.\nThose of you who have worked closely with Pete understand that -- we were reminiscing shortly before the briefing that he's had some of the more challenging issues to discuss in his portfolio, everything certainly from questions about immigration policy, which includes a wide bucket of issues both that are related to homeland security and national security, but also issues like Zika. And so we're obviously very proud of Pete's service. He showed himself to be a dedicated professional. And wherever he ends up next is going to be a place that's extraordinarily lucky to have him.\nSo, thank you, Pete, for your service. I appreciate it.\nSo, with that, Josh, do you want to get started with questions?\nQ: Sure. Thank you, Josh. And thank you, Pete, for your help and hard work over the last several years.\nWhen we met here yesterday, the President was still being briefed on the Russia hacking report. Now that that's concluded, is there anything you can tell us about his impressions of that or what he might have learned that moved the ball from what he had previously known about the extent of Russian hacking, or any preview that you can give us of the unclassified version that Speaker Pelosi -- Minority Leader Pelosi says will be coming out this afternoon?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I don't have a specific presidential reaction to share with you about the report. As leaders of the intelligence community testified yesterday, they are even more certain now of the assessment that they released back in October about the role that Russia played in destabilizing the U.S. elections and trying to cast doubt on the durability of our political system. I am aware that there are reports that this review will be released later today, but for the precise timing of that I'd refer you to the intelligence community.\nI'll tell you that I have not seen the report, so when the unclassified report is released, I'll be reading it along with all of you.\nQ: President-elect Trump is saying that he's asking the House and Senate intelligence panels to investigate NBC News for what he says was top-secret information shared to them prior to his briefing that's taking place as we speak. Can you say whether or not that information put in that report was top secret, and whether it was leaked by the Obama administration to a news outlet prior to President-elect Trump receiving his briefing?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, what I can tell you is that I'm not in a position to confirm the information that was included in that report. I'd refer you to the intelligence community for that. I certainly feel confident in saying that that is not material that was leaked to the public by the White House, but I'd refer you to the intelligence community to speak to it beyond that.\nThe other observation I have, though, is I don't frequently respond to tweets from the President-elect, but I certainly do read them. And I did read two days ago that he was tweeting a steadfast defense of the integrity of the foreigner who runs the leading purveyor of the improper release of classified information retained by the United States government.\nTwo days later -- two days after defending that person's integrity, the President-elect is now expressing some concern about the possible release of this classified information. The original tweet leads me to conclude that his concerns are about something other than protecting classified information. What those concerns are is something that I'll let him articulate, and presumably all of you will have an opportunity to ask about them. But given his track record and certainly given some of the rhetoric that he used in praising WikiLeaks on the campaign trail, I think it would call into question whether or not that's the actual source of concern that he is expressing today.\nQ: Just to button that up, you're ruling out that the White House leaked that information to NBC, but you're not ruling out that another -- that an agency that's part of the intelligence community or another federal agency might have done so?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the inner workings of the intelligence community, particularly as it relates to the compiling of the specific report. The intelligence community was charged by the President of the United States with compiling a report. And as we've discussed at some length over the last couple of months here, the men and women of the United States intelligence community are patriots. And these are people who serve their country. They set aside their own personal political views to do the right thing for the country.\nSo the President has got enormous confidence in them, believes that he's been extraordinarily well served by them over the last eight years in providing to him timely, accurate, specific information that was not shaded to advance a political or ideological agenda, but rather was oriented toward providing him the best possible information so he could make the best possible national security decisions.\nBut for questions about how the intelligence community has handled specific pieces of information, you should go talk to them about that.\nQ: And lastly, since you follow the President-elect's tweets, you'll have seen his comments about the IOU from Mexico that will pay us back for building a wall. And I wanted to ask you about what is being discussed in Congress about using existing authorities to authorize building the wall, and then really just have new appropriations to pay for it until we get paid back. Does the outgoing President feel that if a border wall is going to be built, that there should be a new affirmative vote in Congress to say, yes, this is what we want to do, and this is the direction we're going?\nMR. EARNEST: I have to admit, Josh, I haven't seen all the proposals. I know there are a couple versions of the tweets that were sent, so it's hard to decipher exactly what the plan is.\nWhat I can tell you about President Obama's views is that President Obama strongly supported the largest ever investment in border security in our nation's history that was a part of the common-sense immigration bill that this administration negotiated with Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate.\nThere were billions included in that bill that would have increased security along our border -- investments in technology, investments in physical barriers, and investments in personnel to ensure that our border was secure. Of course, that was coupled with a whole range of other proposals that would be good for our economy, that would be good for reducing the deficit, that would be good for ensuring that the United States of America is living up to our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. It would have ensured that we are not ripping apart families. It certainly would have ensured that we are not seeking to deport young people who are in the United States through no fault of their own, and young people who are American in every way but their papers. That's the kind of proposal that President Obama put forward.\nAnd it gave the millions of people who are in the United States without proper documentation an opportunity to get right with the law, and it would have required them to face some accountability measures -- background checks, paying taxes and other things -- but also would have brought them out of the shadows in a way that would be good for our economy, and in a way that would ultimately have strengthened Social Security and reduced the deficit.\nBut, as I said, the President-elect supports a different approach. The only reason that the President's approach didn't pass is not because it didn't have sufficient bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, but rather because it was a victim of the Republican leadership strategy to say no to everything that President Obama was inclined to support, even if it included policies that they themselves supported. That strategy was cynical, but it did have some political benefits. And it does go down -- the failure of that legislation to pass the House of Representatives, even though it had majority support, even though it would have passed if it had come up for a vote -- does remain one of the most disappointing and frustrating episodes in this administration's relationship with the Republican leadership in Congress.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, a couple other questions related to the President-elect. First, on the intelligence briefing. President-elect Trump called the probe a \"witch hunt.\" What's the White House's feeling about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw the news report. Apparently, he had a conversation with one of your colleagues at The New York Times today.\nI guess I would leave it to his team to characterize exactly what that means. What I can tell you the President directed the intelligence community to do is to learn as much as possible about the kind of malicious cyber activity that we've seen in this country in the context of the 2016 election and in the previous -- recent presidential elections. And the goal was not just to look at one country, but to look at all malicious actors in cyberspace to get to the bottom of what has recently occurred, to understand the trend which appears to be getting worse, and to develop a strategy to counter it.\nThere also was a desire to make sure that we're holding accountable those who were engaged in some of those nefarious acts. And you've already heard some announcements from the administration detailing some aspects of our response. But that is the charge that the intelligence community was supposed to fulfill, and the President is pleased with the work that they've done.\nWe've talked a lot about the service and sacrifice of our\nmen and women in the intelligence community. They worked through the holidays in order to put this report together. And I think it's an indication of their deep commitment to the national security of this country, to fulfilling the directives of the President of the United States. And they have fulfilled the President's expectations of producing a conscientious report that was briefed to him, that will be briefed to Congress, that will be briefed to the President-elect later today -- all at the President's direction. And the intelligence community is also prepared to follow through on the President's final direction, which is to make as much of that report public as possible.\nAnd again, you will have to check with them for the precise timing of that, but some reports indicate that that's coming later today. But that's something that they can confirm.\nQ: On another topic, following up on Josh's question, does this White House think it's realistic or probable that Mexico will reimburse the United States government for a wall built on its border?\nMR. EARNEST: All I would point out, Jeff, is that the Mexican government and the President of Mexico has indicated that that's not going to happen. But I'll leave it to the Mexican government to respond to this, and I'll let the President-elect try to describe how his strategy would work.\nQ: And lastly, the issue of cars and tariffs has come up quite a bit in the last few days. One of the ways that President Trump has discussed via Twitter is related to a foreign company, Toyota, making Mexican-built cars and importing them to the United States, that there would be a tariff on that. Is that realistic? And what is the Obama administration's response to that issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I'm not going to talk about one specific company. I think what I can do is talk about what President Obama's approach to this issue has been. He has actually -- President Obama of course is somebody who has, over his eight years in office, learned quite a lot about the way that the U.S. auto industry works, primarily because it was poised to fail when he entered office. And his administration had to implement a strategy to give them an opportunity to succeed.\nThe President made a big bet on the American auto industry, and he won because he placed his confidence in American autoworkers and giving them a chance to rebuild their companies, to retool their companies, that they would come back better and stronger than ever -- and that's exactly what's happened.\nSo the President has some credentials when it comes to understanding exactly what kinds of policies are going to benefit U.S. autoworkers and more than a million Americans whose jobs depends on that auto industry. And the fact is that the American auto industry actually depends on an integrated global supply chain. That's just the way that our economy works, particularly when you're talking about the production of a modern vehicle. And to try to erect walls that keep out some aspects of that global supply chain or the products that are produced by that global supply chain is only going to have a detrimental impact on the industry and on the workers who rely on that industry for a job.\nSo the President does not believe that that's a smart approach. In fact, what the President believes is that the American auto industry produces the very best automobiles and vehicles in the world, and what we should be looking to do is implementing a strategy that will allow the U.S. auto industry to compete on a level playing field. And that's exactly the strategy that President Obama implemented with regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- to go to countries like Japan and Vietnam that have large economies and a growing middle class, exactly the kinds of places where the U.S. auto industry could compete very well. And looking for opportunities for U.S.-produced goods to be sold around the world is going to be good for our economy, it's going to be good for American companies, but, most importantly, it's going to be good for American jobs.\nI made a reference earlier to the fact that we already know that jobs inside the United States that are tied to exports pay, on average, somewhat higher than jobs in the United States that aren't tied to exports. So looking for more opportunities for U.S. businesses to export their goods around the world, it's going to be good for our economy and good for American workers. But like I said, President-elect Trump wants to try it a different way and we'll see if it works.\nJustin.\nQ: Is the President, as the leader of the Democratic Party, disappointed or upset that the DNC refused requests from the FBI to turn over their server in the hack investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not the responsibility of the President of the United States to make those kinds of decisions. He is of course the nominal head of the Democratic Party, but the Democratic National Committee has an elected leadership that's elected by the members of the Party, and I'll let them speak to the way in which they cooperated with the investigation into this matter.\nQ: Well, is the President, as the nominal head of the Department of Justice for the Obama administration, disappointed that the DNC didn't seem to cooperate with FBI requests?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the Department of Justice speak to the level of cooperation that they received from the DNC and other people who were a part of this investigation. Obviously, this investigation was conducted separate from any sort of White House influence. So it would be inappropriate for me to -- even if the President did have concerns -- for me to express them from here.\nQ: Did you guys know that Theresa May was sending top staffers to meet with the Trump administration last month? And have you or the State Department -- has Theresa May's staff sought advice from you or the State Department on her interactions with the President-elect?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I can't speak to what staff-level conversations may have occurred between representatives of the United States government and representatives of Prime Minister May's office. I can tell you that what the Obama administration has sought to do is to work effectively with our allies and with the President-elect's team to ensure a smooth handoff in the context of the transition, and that includes a smooth handoff of the relationship between the United States and some of our closest allies around the world. But I can't speak with much precision about conversations that may have occurred in advance of those kinds of conversations.\nQ: Lastly, yesterday you promised some preview of the President's speech next week in Chicago. So I'm wondering if you could maybe talk either about some color about how that's developing or what's --\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that I anticipate that the President is going to be devoting a significant portion of his weekend to working on the address. I've had an opportunity to review a very early draft, and what I can tell you is that the President is interested in delivering a farewell address that's forward-looking.\nWe've had ample opportunity, certainly over the last year and over the last couple of months, to review the many significant accomplishments of the Obama administration, and I'm confident there will be a reference or two to that progress in the speech that he'll deliver Tuesday night. But primarily the President is hopeful about the future of the country, particularly if our citizens are engaged in our democracy and if our leaders draw upon the longstanding, deeply-held views of this country to confront the challenges ahead.\nIf that happens, if both those things happen, then the President believes that the prospects for the United States being even more safe, and more prosperous, and more fair are bright. And the President is obviously proud of the progress that we have made and continues to be optimistic about our future, and he's looking forward to an opportunity to talk about why.\nLana.\nQ: So the President has obviously been spending a lot of time talking about Obamacare and trying to fight back against Republican efforts to repeal without a replacement in plan -- in place, rather. After January 20th, is he going to continue that same effort at that same level, or will he, as he was saying before, become a private citizen and just a regular citizen of the United States, and will that then sort of fade away, or will there be a break from that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President will be a private citizen on January 20th. He will be a private citizen with deeply held views about the most effective way to reform the health care system in the United States. Many of those views and ideas have been put into action in a way that's been extraordinarily beneficial for the American people and for our economy. And the President is proud of that progress.\nAnd you could certainly expect the President to follow these developments closely and to continue to be thinking about how these kinds of reforms should work. But there is a long tradition in our country -- and President Obama benefited from it in the early days of his presidency -- of the outgoing President giving the incoming President the opportunity to succeed.\nSo I would not expect President Obama to be regularly holding conversations with Ezra Klein and Sarah Kliff at some other house in Washington, D.C. He did that at Blair House today as the sitting President of the United States. But the President believes that other people, including congressional Democrats, but not only congressional Democrats, are going to have to step forward and take up the mantle and wage this fight on behalf of the American people.\nThe prospect of Republicans repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement would inject unprecedented chaos into our health care system, which constitutes about a fifth of the U.S. economy. It also is going to prompt up to 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance and put at risk many of the gains that we've made in protecting the 130 million Americans that have preexisting conditions. If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you take away those protections. And those are protections that extend not just to people who are purchasing health insurance through Obamacare marketplaces, but it also includes all those Americans that get their health insurance through their employer. So the stakes are significant. And President Obama will remain engaged to the extent that he'll be following exactly what kind of developments occur, he'll continue thinking about these issues.\nBut when it comes to making the public case with this approach, it's time for other people to step up. And the President is confident that there are plenty of Democrats with the right values and the right passion and the right skills to make a persuasive case that will ultimately benefit the American public.\nQ: Just to be clear, with all of his passion that he feels about Obamacare and how he feels about that issue, come January 20th we should not expect to see the President making public speeches about it, writing more op-eds, those sorts of things?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has had ample opportunity over the last eight years to regularly make speeches and regularly write op-eds on topics that are near and dear to his heart, including the effective implementation of health care reform. So the time for him to do that on a regular basis has passed, and so I would not expect him to do that with much frequency at all as a former President.\nQ: Can the White House confirm that Obama-appointed diplomats have been asked to leave their post by January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw the -- I've seen this news report. For all of the details, I'd refer you to the State Department.\nWhat I can tell you is that it is, of course, customary for politically appointed chiefs of mission to return back to the United States on Inauguration Day and afford the incoming administration and the incoming President the opportunity to select his own representatives to advance our country's interests in countries around the world.\nWhat I will say is this administration is extraordinarily proud of the service of the politically appointed ambassadors of the United States government who have advanced our interests in countries large and small around the world. In many cases, these are men and who are professionals in a separate career. But they have chosen to dedicate a number of years of their life to public service in a really important way.\nIn many of these countries where President Obama has traveled, the U.S. ambassador is a prominent public face of the United States of America. And the way that that person chooses to conduct themselves and their personal lives, the way that that person speaks publicly and advances our interests and articulates our values in that country is extraordinarily important. And many of these professionals have taken advantage of this opportunity, and America is better for it.\nAnd we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude for their public service. And we certainly will be hoping that the incoming administration will choose people as effective and as talented and as patriotic as have served in these kinds of positions under President Obama.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about race. The President made some comments about the state of race relations in the country. It has been a difficult time, to say the least, in the city of Chicago in the wake of that Facebook post. I'm curious -- two parts to this question. The first part is, is it fair to describe the President's optimism about the future of race relations in this country based solely on his experience, the trajectory of him growing up and having seen the country in a very different way as President? And does he also understand the negative perception many have about the state of race relations in the country today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think that the President's optimism about the progress that our country has made on the issue of race is rooted primarily in our experience as a country, in our experience as a society.\nThere are a lot of examples of this. And I think the most pertinent one could be around the issue of the relationship between some local law enforcement agencies and the African American community that they're sworn to serve and protect. There are some communities that have been -- where a significant gap has been exposed.\nAnd the President often will cite that it was not that long ago, 20 or 25 years ago, that you had the city of Los Angeles that after a high-profile incident where there were deep concerns about police brutality against a black motorist, that that city was in flames, and that you saw a stark racial divide emerge immediately that was distressing to many people in the country.\nAnd while that gap and that gulf in some communities still exists, the response has been much different; that there are certainly places where there have been public demonstrations and some civil unrest, but nothing on the scale of what we saw in Los Angeles. And I think what's also notable is that there are a number of prominent voices of all races who are speaking out trying to bridge that divide.\nSo I think that's an apt illustration of the situation that we find ourselves in, which is that we've made important progress in a way that actually makes a difference in the lives of Americans in communities all across the country. But we still got a lot of work to do if we're going to solve that problem. And the President also feels optimistic because he has seen the commitment that's been shown by young people -- many of them African American, but not all African American -- who are seeking to organize in their communities, who are seeking to protest the government and make their voice heard, and bring about the kind of change that they would like to see in their community.\nAnd the President is optimistic that they're going to have an impact -- a positive impact -- in addressing those concerns and in healing some of those divisions. And it's this younger generation of activists and younger generation of leaders who the President continues to be optimistic will be able to continue the kind of progress that we've made in healing the racial divide in this country.\nQ: I know you're not being (inaudible) and I respect what you said, but I think there are a number of people that feel very pessimistic when they see incidents like what happened in that Facebook post, when they see shootings -- motorist in South Carolina, the devastating attacks in Dallas. Is the President sensitive to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course, he is. And I think the President himself has expressed his own profound concerns and disappointment and, in some cases, outrage about many of the incidents that you've described, including the Facebook video that drew so much outrage and attention in the last couple of days.\nSo the President certainly understands that we've got a lot of work to do, and there are reasons for people to feel pessimistic that we haven't made as much progress as we would like. But in the President's mind, it's impossible to deny that we have, in fact, made progress. And the fact that you see people of a variety of races speaking out on these issues with one voice, appealing to the same kinds of values, gives the President a lot of optimism that these are problems that can be resolved, where we can make progress. And there certainly is work to be done.\nLook, to go back to something you raised in your first question, there's no denying that the President's personal journey and the personal progress that he's made is one indication of the progress that we've made as a country. The President I think spoke very eloquently about this at Selma a year and a half ago, where you essentially had African Americans who were being beaten and abused by local law enforcement with water cannons and dogs, trying to get -- just so they could have the right to cast a ballot. And 50 years later, you have an African American President of the United States.\nThat's remarkable progress. Doesn't mean that all our work is done, because in too many communities across the country we are seeing people from the minority community being disadvantaged and being denied the right to vote, or at least having had their ability to vote obstructed because of cynical partisan policies that have been put in place.\nSo there's a whole lot more work to be done on that, but certainly the President's story is one powerful indication of the progress that we've made, but it's far from the only one.\nQ: I want to ask you about detainee transfers. We talked a bit about the dwindling number of detainees that are still housed at the facility at Guantanamo. Can you give an update on that and whether or not that will continue to be the trajectory as we wind down the last 14 days?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I know you've been following this closely, so I know that you saw the announcement from the Department of Defense yesterday about the transfer of four Yemeni nationals from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia. That transfer was effectuated after the 30-day notification was provided to Congress, and after a comprehensive review was conducted by the U.S. -- by the President's national security team, including a number of agencies, including the intelligence community, about these individuals being safe to transfer to Saudi Arabia under a set of security restrictions that would limit their ability to threaten the United States.\nThis does bring the prison population -- or the population at Guantanamo Bay to 55. And when President Obama took office, the detainee population at Gitmo was 242. And in that time, we've move 183 detainees to 42 countries. And that certainly is an indication of the progress that we have made in reducing the prison population.\nBut the President does continue to be concerned principally about two things. One is, as the Gitmo facility continues to remain in operation, it continues to serve as a recruiting tool for extremists who hold that up as an example of the United States not living up to the kinds of values that we claim to be fighting for. And to continue to operate that facility is to continue to give terrorist recruiters a valuable tool.\nSecondly, the President is also concerned about the highly inefficient waste of taxpayer dollars. The cost of operating the facility at Gitmo is significantly higher than the cost of operating a similar facility that would effectively safeguard our national security by housing them here in the United States. And there has been no good reasonable explanation put forward about why Congress is intent on preventing that from happening.\nQ: Can I get a cost-per-detainee sort of analysis maybe?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see if we can get you some metrics to put some numbers around that cost-benefit analysis.\nRon.\nQ: On the economy, the President is also going to leave office I believe with the distinction of being the first President since Herbert Hoover not to experience a year of growth at 3 percent GDP. That's correct, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I hadn't heard that statistic, but we can certainly look into it to confirm it for you.\nQ: That's what I've read, that --\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. We'll look into it.\nQ: Assuming that is the truth, does the President accept responsibility for that, as well? And how do you explain that -- you know sluggish growth has been a problem throughout the eight years. How do you explain that -- how do you square that with this historic job growth and so on and so forth? And I think -- the other thing is that some would argue that slow growth is in part what's contributed to this feeling of anxiety in the country that things aren't getting better, and that, in fact, may be one of the crucial variables that just won the election, if you want to keep on going down this road. The question is, how much responsibility does the President accept for the sluggish growth thing? Because I think you're going to say, well, look where we started and look at what Congress did and didn't do, so on and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll say a couple things about that. The first is, the President of the United States is somebody who takes responsibility for what happens in this country while he's President, and President Obama has certainly done that in a variety of settings. Many observers have indicated the important role that the private sector plays in driving our economy, and President Obama has been the first to acknowledge that. He himself gives credit to the private sector driving our recovery. And that recovery has been historic. The President himself has also frequently made the observation that the financial crisis that the United States encountered was not just significant, it was historic -- the largest recession in our nation's history since the Great Depression. And all that occurred right as President Obama was taking office. And so we were digging out of a historically large hole, certainly the largest hole that any President faced dating back to the early stages of the 20th century.\nQ: Just on this -- so how long does the argument last of \"look at the hole we started in\"? For example, how long is that a valid argument into the next administration? You're seven years into it now. You see the point? How long is that a valid explanation for why growth has been so slow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say one other thing and then I'll get to that question, which is -- and you alluded to this, but it's relevant -- during the President's first two years in office, he was able to work effectively with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate to put in place the economic policies that did lay the groundwork for our recovery, everything from the Recovery Act, including the Affordable Care Act. These are policies that were beneficial to the economy, and they led to the kind of growth and progress that is the envy of the world.\nSince then, even the kinds of proposals that have typically enjoyed bipartisan support, that the President has put forward, have not gotten them -- infrastructure investments, immigration reform, even the Trans-Pacific Partnership. All of those are things that would have had a tangible, positive impact on the economy and on job creation.\nSo the President is proud of his economic record, and the progress that we've made is historic. And there is no other President that can cite the kind of job creation streak that President Obama can cite based on what's happened in the economy while he's been President. But there certainly is more that the President believes that we could have done and should have done. But that was not possible because of the obstruction that we ran in to once Republicans took control of the United States Congress.\nWith regard to this question about how do Presidents put into context what they did with their time in office, the President makes what I think is a pretty common-sense illustration of this, which is that he's a better runner in a relay race, and he took the baton from President George W. Bush. And when he took the baton, our economy was at the bottom of a deep hole -- was plunging to the bottom of a deep hole. And he had a lot of uphill running to do while he was holding that baton. That's not a situation that President Trump will face. President Trump, not for the first time in his life, will inherit a much more financially beneficial situation. And he'll have an opportunity to build on that momentum.\nSo I think you can make a strong case that the standard that he should be held to is even higher. He's got many more advantages. He's got the wind at his back. He's got a stable financial system. He's got an economy that's built up momentum, when you evaluate economic growth, when you evaluate job creation, when you evaluate wage growth. And what he does with all of those advantages that he's inherited is up to him, and he'll face -- we'll have an opportunity to evaluate his performance.\nQ: To follow up on this intelligence briefing matter, back-and-forth, and given that the President and the President-elect have some rapport and have this handful of exchanges by phone and then otherwise, would you expect that there might be a conversation between the two of them about this briefing and what it means, and this particular issue because it's so prominent and because I would imagine the President feels so passionately about it?\nMR. EARNEST: There is not plan for the President to call the President-elect. That's not on his schedule today. So I suppose if the President-elect were to call him, he'd return the call. He's been doing that -- done that a number of times since the election.\nBut, look, as our intelligence leaders testified yesterday, there's not a lot of ambiguity in this situation. They're not expressing a lot of ambiguity in their public statements. Certainly, their October statement was not ambiguous. Their testimony yesterday before Congress was not ambiguous. I'll let them speak to what's included in the report, and we'll have an opportunity to take a look at the unclassified report when it's released. I'd be surprised if there's anything in there that's particularly ambiguous. If there is, it may be because of the need to protect sources and methods. But --\nQ: And because of the lack of ambiguity, as you point out and others have, and because this is a matter of national security, is it reasonable to expect that the President of the United States might call up the President-elect and say, look, you need to think about this differently? I mean, it would just seem like a natural thing to do if, in fact, the President is so concerned about this, as he rightfully perhaps should be and has said that he is.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think what I can tell you is I certainly wouldn't rule out that this is an issue that they've discussed previously. Now, I'm going to protect their ability to have private conversations, so I can't sort of catalogue the conversations that they've had. But I think common sense would lead you to conclude that this an issue that they've talked about before. And given the significance of this incident and given the unambiguous nature of the intelligence community's work, I suspect that this is an issue that will continue to be discussed both publicly and privately.\nCertainly, we've seen leaders on Capitol Hill, including Republicans, indicate their commitment to continuing to investigate this matter and learn as much as they can about it, and begin to take steps to prevent the kind of negative impact we saw from happening again. So I guess I wouldn't rule out future conversations, but I do not anticipate a telephone call between the President and the President-elect on this specific topic today. But of course, if the President-elect calls the President of the United States, he'll call him back.\nQ: There could be other communications methods.\nMR. EARNEST: There could be. So that's part of our commitment to the transition.\nQ: Just using my common sense, as you've suggested, it would seem logical, then, that the President has talked to him about this, and yet the President-elect has still expressed publicly so much skepticism about the intelligence findings.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they obviously disagree on a lot of things.\nQ: And just on this whole matter of tweeting --\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe that's the understatement of the day, huh? (Laughter.)\nQ: On this matter on -- you made a reference to tweeting earlier, that you read all of them but you don't --\nMR. EARNEST: I try to. It's hard to keep up sometimes.\nQ: What does the President think about that? The fact that he does this -- not necessarily the content, but the fact that the President-elect is communicating in this manner.\nMR. EARNEST: I think you can tell from the President's communication style that he believes that communicating in a different way plays to his strengths, and I think in some ways that contrast was quite stark. Even just this morning, the President was engaged in a serious, detailed, long discussion of the intricacies of health care policy. Those are the kinds of arguments and facts and presentations that don't lend themselves to 140-character limits.\nBut obviously, the President-elect has a different communication style and it certainly contributed to some of his success in building support for his campaign. Whether that's a style that he believes will benefit him once he has assumed all of the awesome responsibilities of the President of the United States is something that I think we'll all just have to wait to find out.\nQ: And given all these awesome responsibilities, does the President think, as others have said, that this method of communication is dangerous?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I should also clarify, President Obama has a Twitter feed too. He's got tens of millions of supporters and followers on Twitter -- or presumably they aren't all supporters. I'm sure they're not.\nBut he's got a lot of followers on Twitter. It can be an effective method of communication, but when every word and the meaning of every utterance is so closely scrutinized to try to detect its precise impact on global events, sometimes the 140- character limit has some downsides. Sometimes it requires some more explanation to make sure people understand exactly what you mean. And when you're President of the United States, it's important for people in this country and around the world to understand exactly what you mean.\nQ: And lastly, in other news, you said you might have some details about the party tonight.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have additional details about the party tonight.\nQ: Or any details.\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned earlier, the President and First Lady are hosting a party here at the White House tonight. It will be an opportunity for them to spend some time with their friends, and I suspect it will be the last opportunity for them to be able to host such an event before they leave the White House.\nQ: Any names on the guest list?\nMR. EARNEST: No names that I have to release from here.\nQ: Hundreds of people? Millions of people?\nMR. EARNEST: It will not be millions of people. (Laughter.) It will be smaller than that. But the President and First Lady are looking forward to it, and this is something that they've done before, and it's one of the things that they will miss about the White House in terms of their personal life and being able to share some of the -- how special that is with their friends in the way that millions of Americans have gotten a glimpse of the specialness of the White House through White House tours.\nQ: Are you going?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll keep you posted on my Friday night plans.\nMark.\nQ: By any chance did you ask President Obama about what Vice President Biden said yesterday -- that Donald Trump ought to grow up when it comes to some of his tweets and name-calling?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not speak to President Obama about it. I can give you my reaction, if you care, which is just simply that Vice President Biden is somebody who, through his four-decade career here in Washington, has developed a reputation for an avuncular communication style.\nQ: Avuncular? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. It seems to generate headlines sometimes, but I think what many people have found is that they have benefitted from following the advice of Vice President Biden.\nQ: Would a comment like that be in the spirit of the smooth and seamless transition that President Obama wanted?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the Vice President, just like everybody else in this administration, has in words and deeds demonstrated a clear commitment and extended courtesies to the incoming President's team.\nAnd I know that that is certainly true of the Vice President's staff, but I also know that that's true of the Vice President himself. Earlier this week, he happened to be walking the halls at the same time that somebody on our team was showing my successor around the West Wing, and the Vice President graciously invited Mr. Spicer into this office and spent some time talking to him about how special it is to work at the White House. And I think that's a pretty clear indication of the Vice President's commitment to ensuring that all of us -- including the Vice President -- are committed to the kind of smooth and effective transition that President Obama directed.\nQ: And earlier in an answer to Ron, you said the President is proud of his economic record. How does that statement relate to the national debt, an issue that we rarely hear on in this room or from the President, a national debt that is nearing $20 trillion, an 87 percent increase over what it was when he took office? Certainly -- well, would you regard that as a blot on his economic record?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I think certainly the President's record when it comes to fiscal responsibility is quite strong. The deficit has been reduced by two-thirds since President Obama took office. And the reason that that's important is if we can get the deficit-to-GDP ratio down around 3 percent, that's going to allow us to stabilize the debt as a percentage of GDP. And that's the metric that economists look at.\nAnd there has been a lot of progress made in terms of asking those at the top of the income scale to pay a little bit more, in terms of strengthening the economy and raising the amount of tax revenue that's coming into the U.S. government.\nThere have also been some cuts to government spending, some of which were fashioned in a different way than President Obama would have preferred, but yet resulted in the kind of deficit reduction that's been good for the country and good for our economy. But there is more work that needs to be done to address the medium- and long-term consequences of the nation's fiscal picture. And that will certainly be something that the incoming President and the Republican leadership in Congress will have to address.\nWe certainly have heard a lot from congressional Republicans about their desire to reduce the deficit. And we'll see if they have the same success that President Obama has had\nin reducing the deficit by two-thirds over the next eight years.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. We're talking a lot about domestic policy today. Will the President in his speech in Chicago discuss foreign policy at all?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that the President will talk a little bit about the work that is necessary to advance our interests and to keep America safe. But I would not anticipate that that will be the focus of his farewell address.\nQ: What do you say to people who argue that given the continued problems in the Middle East and Syria and in Iraq, the inability to defeat ISIS completely, the growing tensions and years-long problems with Russia that seem to be increasing, even the problems in Europe that seem to be growing with democracies, people losing power, and allies facing new challenges -- what do you say to people who would argue that the President has not left the country in a stronger position in foreign affairs for Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd say a couple things about that, and I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to do that.\nThe first is that when President Obama took office, there were 180,000 U.S. servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and today that number is down below 15,000, I believe. And I think that is an indication of the important progress that President Obama has made.\nEach President is going to face unique challenges and a unique set of circumstances in the international community. And what President Obama has sought to do is to strengthen our relationships with our closest allies. And the President feels good about the progress that we've made in strengthening our relationship with countries who are part of our NATO Alliance. The incoming President indicated that he might try to do something a little bit different. This President certainly hopes that he won't, but we'll have to see how he chooses to manage those relationships.\nPresident Obama is proud of the way that we have overhauled and strengthened the relationship that the United States has with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, and some of that is because of the policy change that we made with regard to Cuba. That certainly has created ample opportunities for the United States to strengthen our relationship with countries throughout Latin America. Obviously, the President had the opportunity to visit Argentina in 2016. That was a good example of some of the improvements that we've made.\nI will say that the President is disappointed that Congress didn't act to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That certainly had the potential to strengthen our security and economic relationships throughout the Asia Pacific. That was a missed opportunity, but I don't think that's one that you can pin on the President of the United States, because he did the hard work of negotiating the kind of an agreement that would have advanced our interests, and it didn't move forward because of Congress's failure to act.\nThe last thing I'll say is when President Obama took office, the number-one threat that was identified by the United States and our allies around the world was the risk that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon. That would be extraordinarily destabilizing to not just the Middle East, but to the world. It would be extraordinarily concerning to our closest ally, Israel. And it would pose a threat to our allies in Europe that are within range of some of Iran's missile capabilities.\nBut because of the principled, hardnosed diplomacy of this administration, the United States succeeded in reaching an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And the international community can now verify that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon, and is now farther away from being able to get a nuclear weapon than they have been in some time, and there are restrictions in place to make sure that that timeframe is not shortened. And if it is, the international community will know about it and will be able to react.\nBut all of that was accomplished without deploying a single soldier or firing a single shot. And that certainly is a testament to the President's success in addressing some of the most significant threats facing the United States.\nAnd then I'll end just by mentioning the fact that President Obama took office with Osama bin Laden continuing to try to menace the United States. He no longer is in a position to do that.\nMichelle.\nQ: While we've been sitting here, there's been a shooting at Fort Lauderdale Airport in a baggage claim area, and it seems like multiple people have been shot and multiple people have been killed. Given that we don't know what the motive is, do you know at this point, or do any of you know if the President has been notified?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if the President's has been notified but we can certainly look into that for you. Obviously these are the kinds of events that we see all too often here in the United States. And our thoughts and prayers right now are with those who are potentially affected, and certainly with the first responders in south Florida who right now are surely putting themselves in harm's way to try to protect innocent people. And so we're thinking about them right now, and we'll\nPresident getting updated on this situation. And we'll let you know as soon as we can.\nQ: Okay, and what do you think of the President-elect asking Congress now -- and he says he's going to ask congressional committees -- to investigate the leaking of information to -- NBC News is the only one he named. What's your reaction to that, especially given that this administration prosecuted leakers multiple times?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as I mentioned to Josh, just two days ago on his Twitter feed the President-elect was defending the integrity of the foreigner who is the leading purveyor of government secrets maintained by the United States that we'd prefer not be released. These are secrets that have made the United States -- by virtue of their release, has made the United States less safe and has put our men and women in uniform and our men and women in the intelligence community at greater risk. Why he's defending his integrity, I do not know. But it would lead me to conclude that the tweet that he sent today about NBC was prompted by something other than his concern about the inappropriate release of classified information.\nQ: So would you disagree with calling for an investigation on this particular leak?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, obviously he called on Congress to take a look at it, and I'll defer to members of Congress about how they want to use their investigative authorities.\nThe one thing I think I would point out is that the Department of Justice with regard to the way that they interact, the way that they conduct leak investigations, and the way that they interact with reporters and protect the First Amendment rights of reporters, they have made clear and codified that journalists should not face punishment just for doing their job. And that is a principle that has been established and strengthened and codified by the Obama administration. And hopefully that's something that Mr. Sessions will continue, if and when he is confirmed to be the next leader of the Department of Justice.\nQ: Okay, and the President said something interesting today during that Vox interview. He said that he would support a repeal of Obamacare if the replacement was something better. And that's a lot different than what we've been talking about in here that you said Democrats shouldn't even work with Republicans if repeal is a method they choose. So do you think the President was saying something different here? Or was that just his way of saying in his view there's no way that anything is going to be better?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what he was -- he was actually giving voice to the same argument that I was making, which is simply that if Republicans are willing to sit down and look for ways to improve the health care system, improve upon Obamacare, and are willing to work with Democrats to do that, then the President believes that Democrats should work with them. And it sounded to me like today he volunteered to be one of them.\nQ: But even if they want to repeal it? It sounds like he's saying something different than --\nMR. EARNEST: The President is simply saying that if Republicans have ideas that will be better for the American people, better for our economy -- and we've got a way to judge, right, based on the people that -- based on the way that access to health care has dramatically expanded under the Affordable Care Act, based on the consumer protections that are in place, based on the way that the deficit has been reduced, based on the way that the Medicare trust fund has been strengthened. If Republicans have a plan to meet all of that criteria and they can do it, and it cover even more people or do it for even less money, then President Obama -- I guess the point the President is making is there's no pride of authorship here. And I think that should have been evident from the beginning as the President invited Republicans to take the pen and to put forward their own ideas. And in fact, the President has willingly shared credit with the Heritage Foundation, who originally conceived of some of the key aspects of this plan. He has readily shared credit with people like Mitt Romney, whose health care plan in Massachusetts served as a template for the Affordable Care Act.\nHe didn't do that because he's good buddies with Mitt Romney -- he's not. Mitt Romney ran against him in 2012, but yet President Obama was willing to use the template that he developed because it was a good idea, and it worked in Massachusetts and it's worked for the United States of America.\nSo the President is basically making the point there's no pride of authorship here. If Republicans have ideas that are actually going to make the health care system better, the President will help them and encourage them and support them as they try to implement it. The problem has been that for seven years, Republicans have insisted on simply voting to repeal the law without ever putting forward any sort of realistic plan to replace it. And some of the ideas that they have floated would not make the health care system in this country better or cheaper or cover more people; it would make many of those problems worse.\nAnd that's the tension. As long as Republicans are only focused on throwing our health care system into chaos, I don't think they're going to find much support at all from Democrats. And I think they're going to have trouble maintaining support among a lot of Republicans who are concerned about the impact that chaos would have on families and businesses in their home states.\nLet's see -- Olivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Over the last eight years we've seen a series of spectacular cyber intrusions, whether by the United States or against the United States. I'm wondering under what circumstances the President thinks either an act of hacking or an act of cyber sabotage becomes an act of war.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't asked this policy question of the President or our experts. With regard to the Russian involvement in malicious cyber activity that was aimed at trying to destabilize our election, the President believed that that was a very serious incident. That's what led to the extraordinary statement from the intelligence community. That's what led to the serious response that was publicized by the administration last week. That's what led the President of the United States to raise these issues directly with President Putin when they saw one another in Asia this past fall. And I think that's why -- I know that's why the President also directed the intelligence community to produce a comprehensive report that could be shared not just with this administration but with the incoming administration, with members of Congress in both parties, and with the public about what exactly happened. Getting to the bottom of this is important because what happened is so serious.\nBut I will say that I'd want you to talk to somebody with a little bit more expertise in this policy area before I took on the hypothetical question about what kind of malicious cyber activity would genuinely constitute an act of war.\nQ: I ask because this morning at a breakfast with reporters, Senator Bob Corker, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested that the question of intent here was paramount, saying that the collection of information is not an act of war, but perhaps the use of that information might be. And that's why I'm asking sort of what the President's criteria are -- not so much hypothetical -- what are they.\nMR. EARNEST: Without having thought through a lot of that, I think that certainly is a reasonable statement from Senator Corker that intent of the malicious actor is not irrelevant. And I know that the intelligence community, as we previously stated, has done a lot of work to try to understand not just what Russia did and how they did it, but also to try to get some insight into what their motivation may have been and what their goal may have been.\nWe know at least one of their goals was to raise some doubts about the integrity of our system of democracy and the ability of the United States government to execute an election. But if there were additional motivations, we'll have to see what the intelligence community has been able to learn.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one, then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: Thank you very much, Josh. You've said repeatedly, including just a few minutes ago, that the Republicans in Congress have no alternative to the Affordable Health Care Act if it's repealed, and yet in 2015, when the Supreme Court looked again at its constitutionality, Senator Cassidy of Louisiana, himself a doctor, unveiled a detailed plan with -- keeping some aspects of the previous plan, but offering new ones. Today, Republicans on Capitol Hill say they have seven plans that are on the table, including Senator Cassidy's. Why is there sort of a difference in your view and what they're saying on the Hill, and in particular in the case of one senator who did put forth a plan?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, John, right now it's a pretty simple situation that we have, which is if Republicans had a plan that they had confidence in, that they believed measured up to the Affordable Care Act, that they believed would garner sufficient political support among Republicans on Capitol Hill, then why wouldn't they put it forward?\nBut even the Speaker of the House himself is saying they'll get around to putting forward a replacement at some point, hopefully later this year. If there are so many plans that they've been talking about for so long, why aren't they prepared to put them forward and use them as the replacement for the Affordable Care Act?\nSo they'll have -- because the truth is, John -- this is the other part of it that I think is relevant. It is new that Republicans for the first time are in charge of the White House, but it's not new that Republicans are in charge of the Congress for the first time.\nThey had congressional majorities last year and the year before that. And I'm not aware of those Republicans using their majority to pass an Obamacare alternative. They didn't. So that's why I doubt that there actually is a plan that they're willing to put forward, that they're willing to stand behind, that they're willing to evaluate in comparison to all of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act that the American people have been enjoying for years now.\nQ: The other question that I had was, there was a number, 1,030 -- 1,030 -- that I'm sure you've seen that's been in numerous articles from Christmas to January.\nMR. EARNEST: You're laying it on thick here, John.\nQ: All right. I'm just telling you.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: That is the number of Democratic senators, governors, U.S. representatives, and state legislators who have lost their seats to Republicans in the last eight years under President Obama. As the leader of the Democratic Party, a position you mentioned earlier, has he ever expressed any thoughts about these losses, which I believe are the biggest for an incumbent President since Herbert Hoover was President during the Depression?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, I think it's always important to evaluate the context of those numbers. And one important piece of context is simply that there was an historic wave that entered office at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 of Democratic elected officials who benefitted from President Obama being at the top of the ballot in 2008. So when we're talking about those kinds of numbers, it's important to recognize that those numbers got built up in the first place because of President Obama's political success in winning the White House the first time.\nThat said, the President is the leader of the Democratic Party. And he has been disappointed, particularly with regard to this most recent election, that a lot of good Democratic elected officials, public servants didn't succeed at the ballot box. And the President has expressed his view about why that is. It includes the need for Democratic activists and Democratic voters to express their view persuasively in communities all across the country, and that certainly is part of the challenge that President Obama is going to spend some time thinking about as a former President. And this will certainly be the challenge that the incoming Democratic Party chairman will take on in taking office and making sure that Democrats are showing up and competing in communities all across the country.\nWe've got the values right, we've got the policy prescriptions right, but we just need to go and make the argument. And the President is confident that if and when Democrats do that, there are important gains for the party and for the country that lie ahead.\nLet me just run through the week ahead real quick.\nOn Saturday, the President will travel to Jacksonville, Florida to attend the wedding ceremony of a White House staffer. There will be no media coverage of the event. This is just a private event and the President is looking forward to it.\nOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Tuesday, the President will travel to Chicago, Illinois, as we've discussed, to deliver his farewell address to the American people. In the address, he will thank his supporters, celebrate the ways the country has changed these past eight years, and offer some thoughts on where the country will go from here. The First Lady, the Vice President, and Dr. Biden will also attend.\nThrough the rest of the week, the President intends to attend meetings at the White House and it should be an interesting week.\nThanks, everybody, have a great weekend.\nQ: Can you tell us the staffer's name or --\nMR. EARNEST: We'll follow up with you on that tomorrow.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:11 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-01-06", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

I'm Ezra Klein, founder and editor-in-chief of Vox, here alongside my colleague Sarah Kliff. We are honored to be here today to speak with President Obama about the Affordable Care Act: its performance, its passage, and its now uncertain future. I think we'd all prefer to hear from him than from me so I won't waste any more of your time with introduction. Please join me in welcoming President Barack Obama.\nThe President. Hello, hello, hello. Thank you.\nVox Senior Editor Sarah Kliff. All right.\nThe President. Good morning.\nMs. Kliff. Good morning. Yes.\nMr. Klein. Good morning. Thank you for being here.\nThe President. It is great to be here. And thank you so much for all the good reporting you guys have been doing on this important issue.\nMr. Klein. Well, thank you.\nMs. Kliff. All right. So we will get started. So there was an expectation that was shared among many of your staff, many congressional Democrats, that as the Affordable Care Act rolled out, as it delivered benefits to millions of people, that it would become more popular. It would be safe from repeal or even substantial reform. And it appears, at this point, that doesn't seem to be quite true. What do you think that theory got wrong? Why didn't the health care law become more popular?\nThe President. Well, let's back up and say from the start, there's a reason why for a hundred years no President could get expansion of health care coverage beyond the work that had been done for Medicare and Medicaid, targeting primarily seniors. And the reason was that this is hard. The health care system is big; it is very personal. Families, I think, recognize the need for health insurance, but it's not something that they think about except when things go wrong, when you have an accident or you're sick. And so any costs, particularly at a time when families are feeling stressed economically, any added costs, higher premiums, higher copays, all that ends up having real impacts on families.\nAnd so the challenge of getting it passed was always the fact that, unlike other advanced countries, we didn't start with a system in which everybody was covered, and we have a very complicated marketplace, and we have third-party insurers. And what that meant was that even after we got the law passed anything that dissatisfied people about the health care system could be attributed to—quote, unquote—\"Obamacare,\" even if it had nothing to do with Obamacare. And that was something that we recognized even when we were trying to get the law passed.\nBut the other thing is the fact that the unwillingness of Republicans in Congress and around the country, including some Governors, to, after the fight was over, say, all right, let's try to make this work—the way Democrats did during the time when President Bush tried to expand the prescription drug program, Part D—meant that the public never heard from those who had originally been opposed any concession that, you know what, this is actually doing some good. And that ends up affecting public opinion.\nAnd the third thing is that whenever you look at polls that say 40-something percent are supportive of the law and 40-something percent are dissatisfied, in the dissatisfied column are a whole bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters who wanted a single-payer plan. [Laughter] And so the problem is not that they think Obamacare is a failure; the problem is that they don't think it went far enough and that it left too many people still uncovered, that the subsidies that people were getting weren't as rich as they should have been, that there's a way of dealing with prescription drug makers in a way that drives down those costs. And so all those things meant that even after the law was passed, there was going to still be a lot tough politics.\nHaving said all that, the thing that I've been most proud of is the fact that not only have we gotten 20 million people covered, not only have we been able to reduce the pace at which health care costs have been going up—ever since the law was passed, basically health care inflation has been as low as it's been in 50 years, which has saved the Federal Government hundreds of billions of dollars, extended the Medicare trust fund by 11 years—but most importantly, for the people who have gotten insurance through the exchanges, there's been pretty high satisfaction rates, as surveys have shown.\nSo rather than look at public opinion as a whole, the thing I've been most interested in is, how is this affecting the people who have gotten benefits? These are real families who have gotten real coverage. And I get letters every single day from people who say, this has saved my life, or this has saved my bank account, or this has made sure that my son who got hooked on some sort of opioid was able to get treatment, or I was able to get a mammogram that caught a cancer in time. And that ultimately is the measure of the success of the law.\nMr. Klein. So do you think this dynamic where when you reform the health care system, you own it, goes the other way? Republicans are beginning with the repeal-and-delay strategy. President-elect Trump has said that he does want to repeal Obamacare, but he also wants to replace it with something that covers as many people, or he said that at least at certain points.\nDo you think that the dynamic in which you became responsible for what people didn't like is going to hamper Republican movement in their efforts to change a system that maybe they don't like, but does have a lot of people relying on it?\nThe President. Well, let me start from a very simple premise: If it works, I'm for it. If something can cover all Americans, make sure that if they have a preexisting condition they can still get coverage, make sure that prescription drugs are affordable, encourage preventive measures to keep people healthy, that makes sure that in rural communities people have access to substance abuse care or mental health care, that Medicare and Medicaid continue to function effectively—if you can do all that cheaper than we talked about, cheaper than Obamacare achieves and with better quality and it's just terrific, I'm for it. [Laughter]\nI think that part of the challenge in this whole debate—and this is true, dating back to 2009, back to 2010—is this idea that somehow we had a fixed way of trying to fix the health care system, that we were rigid and stubborn and wouldn't welcome Republican ideas, and if we only had, they had all these great solutions. In fact, if you look at how this law evolved—and I've said this publicly before—if I was starting from scratch, I probably would have supported a single-payer system because it's just easier to—for people to understand and manage. And that's essentially what Medicare is, is a single-payer system for people of a certain age. And people are very satisfied with it, and it's not that complicated to understand or to access services. But that's—that wasn't available; we weren't starting from scratch. So what did I then do? I said, well, where is a system out there that seems to be providing coverage for everybody that politically we could actually get through a Congress and where we could get Republican support? And lo and behold, in Massachusetts there was a plan that had been designed on a bipartisan basis—including by a Republican Governor who ultimately became the nominee for the Republican Party—that came close to providing universal coverage. And I would have thought, since this was an idea that had previously gotten a lot of Republican support, that it would continue to get a lot of Republican support. And yet, somehow, magically, the minute we said this is a great idea and it's working, Republicans said this is terrible and we don't want to do this. [Laughter]\nSo I say all this, Ezra, simply to make something very clear. From the very start, in the earliest negotiations in 2009 and 2010, I made clear to Republicans that, if they had ideas that they could show would work better than the ideas that we had thought of, I would be happy to incorporate them into the law. And rather than offer ideas, what we got was a big no, we just don't want to do this.\nAfter the law passed, for the last 6, 7 years, there has been the argument that we can provide a great replacement that will be much better for everybody than what the Affordable Care Act is providing. And yet, over the last 6, 7 years, there has been no actual replacement law that any credible health care policy experts have said would work better. In fact, many of them would result in millions of people losing coverage and the coverage being worse for those who kept it.\nAnd so now is the time when Republicans, I think, have to go ahead and show their cards. If in fact they have a program that would genuinely work better and they want to call it whatever they want—they can call it Trumpcare, they can call it McConnellcare or Ryancare—[laughter]—if it actually works, I will be the first one to say, great, you should have told me that back in 2009. I asked. [Laughter] I suspect that will not happen.\nAnd the reason it will not happen is because if you want to provide coverage to people, then there are certain baseline things that you've got to do. Number one, health care is not cheap. And for people who can't afford health care or don't get it through the job, that means the Government has got to pay some money.\nNumber two, all those provisions that the Republicans say they want to keep and that they like—for example, making sure that people can get health insurance even if they have a preexisting condition—well, it turns out that the only way to meet that guarantee is to either make sure that everybody has some modest obligation to get health care so that they're not gaming the system, or you've got to be willing to provide huge subsidies to the insurance companies so that they're taking in people who are already sick.\nAnd I think what you're going to see now—now that you have a Republican President-elect, you have Republicans who control both Chambers in Congress—is that all the promises they made about how they can do it better, cheaper, everybody is going to be satisfied, are going to be really hard to meet.\nAnd this is why the strategy of repeal first and replace later is just a huge disservice to the American people and is something that I think, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, you should be opposed to. These are real lives at stake.\nI'm getting letters right now from people who say, I am terrified because my son's or daughter's insurance, their ability to get lifesaving drugs, their ability to get drug treatment, their ability to get mental health services are entirely dependent on us being able to afford and keep our insurance. And if in fact there's going to be a massive undoing of what's one-sixth of our economy, then the Republicans need to put forward very specific ideas about how they're going to do it. People need to be able to debate it, they need to be able to study it the same way they did when we passed the Affordable Care Act. And let the American people gauge, is this going to result in something better than what Obamacare has produced?\nAnd if they're so convinced that they can do it better, they shouldn't be afraid to make that presentation. It is really interesting to try to figure out, why is it that they're trying to rush the repeal so quick? I mean, what is it that they're afraid of? Why wouldn't they want to say, here's our plan, and show, side by side, here's why our plan is better than what Obamacare has produced? Because they have said, absolutely, adamantly, that they can do it better.\nI am saying to every Republican right now, if you, in fact, can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan. But I want to see it first. [Laughter] I want to see it first. And I want third-party, objective people—whether it's the Congressional Budget Office or health care experts across the ideological spectrum, or Vox, or whoever——\nMr. Klein. We'd be happy to, yes. [Laughter] Thank you.\nThe President. ——to just evaluate it. And the public will not have to take my word for it. They can—we can designate some referees. And if they can show that they can do it better, cheaper, more effective, provide better coverage, why wouldn't I be for it? Why wouldn't I be for it?\nThis idea that somehow, oh, this is about Obama preserving his legacy or—keep in mind, I'm not the one who named it Obamacare. [Laughter] They were the ones who named it Obamacare, because what they wanted to do was personalize this and feed on antipathy towards me in their party as an organizing tool, as politics.\nBut I don't have a pride of authorship on this thing. If they can come up with something better, I'm for it. But you have to show—and I would advise every Democrat to be for it—but you have to show that it's better. And that's not too much to ask. And that's the challenge.\nAnd the question right now for Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell is, why is it that you feel obliged to repeal it before you show what it is that is going to replace?\nBecause the majority of Americans have been very clear that they think that's a bad idea. You now have Republican Governors, some Republican Senators, who have said, we don't think that's a good idea. And there's been no real explanation to why you would actually try to do this before the new President is even inaugurated. [Laughter] What exactly is this rush? Particularly if you're going to delay the actual repeal.\nIf they were making the argument that this is so disastrous that we actually think we have to repeal it completely today because it's just terrible, well, I would disagree, but at least I could understand it. But here you're saying, I'm—we're going to vote to repeal, but then were going to delay its effects for a couple of years. Well, why, if it's so bad?\nAnd if it's—if the answer is, well, it would be disruptive and we don't want to take people's insurance away right away, well, then that means you have time to show us and, more importantly, show the American people who need health insurance what exactly you're replacing it with.\nIn that sense—Ezra, I know that was a long answer to—[laughter]—but in that sense, the answer is the Republicans, yes, will own the problems with the health care system if they choose to repeal something that is providing health insurance to a lot of people and providing benefits to every American who has health insurance even if they're getting it through the job, and they haven't shown us what it is that they're going to do. Then, they do own it, because that is irresponsible. And even members of their own party, even those who are opposed to me, have said that that is an irresponsible thing to do.\nMs. Kliff. Let me follow up a little bit on the congressional fight. So we saw yesterday President-elect Donald Trump, he said on Twitter, \"It was time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a health care plan that really works\"—which is something—I remember you saying similar things in 2009, 2010, when I was covering this debate. Knowing what you know now about partisanship, being a President who has tried to do this, was, like you said, unable to get Republican votes, what three pieces of advice would you give someone trying to attempt to pass a bipartisan health care law?\nThe President. Well, look, I think I sort of gave the advice just now, which is, if in fact this is not about politics but this is about providing the best possible health care system for the American people, then my advice would be to say what precisely is it about Obamacare that you think doesn't work. Because you've already said that there are some things you think do work. Right?\nThe Republicans keep on saying, well, we want to keep the things that people like and that are working well. So they think that it's a good idea that Obamacare says your kids can stay on your health insurance plan until they're 26. They think that's a good idea. They think it's a good idea that if you've got a preexisting condition you can still get health insurance. I assume they think it's a good idea that seniors have gotten discounts on their prescription drugs; we closed the \"doughnut hole\" during the course of Obamacare. They approve of some of the changes we've made to encourage a health care system that rewards quality rather than just the number of procedures involved, right, the—and how we pay providers.\nSo we could make a list of all the things that, as terrible as Obamacare is, actually they think works, according to them. All right, well, let's make, then, a list of the things they don't like or the American people are concerned about.\nWell, what we know is that people would always like lower costs on their premiums and their out-of-pocket expenses. And although the Affordable Care Act provides a lot of subsidies to a lot of people so they can afford health insurance, what is absolutely true is, we would love to see even higher subsidies to relieve the costs even more. But that costs money.\nWhat we also know is that where we've seen problems in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, it has been in certain areas, particularly more rural areas, less densely populated areas, where we're not seeing as many insurers, so there's not as much competition. Well, one way that we've suggested you could solve that problem is to say that if in fact there aren't enough insurers to drive competition and reduce costs and give people enough choices, then we should have a public option that's available.\nSo if you look at the things that people are frustrated about with Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, the big things are the subsidies aren't as high as they'd like and they don't have as many options as they'd like. And I'm happy to provide those—both those things. I'd sign on to a Republican plan that said we're going to give more subsidies to people to make it even cheaper, and we're going to have a public option where there isn't an option.\nHere's the problem. I don't think that's the thing that they want—[laughter]—to do.\nMs. Kliff. I don't think so, no.\nThe President. But I guess my point is this, that it is possible for people of good will to try to come up with significant improvements to the law that we already have, but it does require to be specific about what it is that you think needs to be changed. And that, so far, has not happened. And my advice to the President-elect, —in fact, we talked about this when I met with him for an hour and a half right after he got elected—I said make your team and make the Republican Members of Congress come up with things that they can show will actually make this work better for people. And if they're convincing, I think you would find that there are a lot of Democrats out there—including me—that would be prepared to support it. But so far, at least, that's not what's happened.\nMr. Klein. So I think Obamacare has exposed an interesting tension between controlling costs in the system and controlling economic pain for individuals.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Klein. So the law has, until now, come in under budget. But in part, the ways it's done that are higher deductibles than people expected, higher copays, narrower networks. In a couple of years, if it doesn't change, the excise tax on high-value insurance will come into play, the individual mandate. And these things, to individual people, while they keep the usage of health care down and they keep the cost of health care down, they make health care feel more expensive. They make health care feel unusable.\nDo you think the Affordable Care Act got the balance right on controlling system-wide costs versus insulating individuals from their health expenses?\nThe President. Well, let me make a couple distinctions. First of all, part of what happened at the beginning of the marketplaces—and for those who aren't wonks—[laughter]—I was teasing Ezra and Sarah, I said this is like a Wonkapalooza. [Laughter] These—this is some serious policy detail here.\nBut so the marketplaces are basically just those places where insurers put up, here's the insurance package we're offering, and you can choose from a variety of different packages, and then once you've chosen, you can figure out the subsidies that you're qualified for, and it will give you a sense of what your out-of-pocket costs are.\nAnd what we've discovered was that a lot of insurers underpriced early on, because they had done surveys and—look, people who are purchasing health insurance are like people who are purchasing everything else, they'd like to get the best deal for the lowest price. What makes health care tricky is, when you buy a TV you can kind of see what the picture looks like; when you're buying health insurance, it's tempting to initially buy the cheapest thing—until if heaven forbid, you get sick and it turns out, gosh, I can't see the doctor I want or the specialist I want, or this is more inconvenient than I expected.\nSo what ended up happening was people bought, oftentimes, the cheapest insurance that they could. Insurance companies, wanting to get as much market share as possible, ended up creating very low-cost plans, but those are going to have restrictions on them. And that's not just if you're buying health insurance in Obamacare, that's generally how it is even when employers buy health insurance for their employees.\nNow, I think that what we're seeing is insurers now making adjustments, saying, okay, we need to charge more. And that is something that, the good news is, appears to—may have stabilized—that might be kind of a one-time thing, and now we're in a position to be able to do an evaluation of, have we gotten this balance right, as you say?\nWe can't get health care for free. You're going to have to pay for it one way or another. Either the Government is going to pay more so that people don't have as many out-of-pocket costs—and that means, in some fashion, higher taxes for somebody—or individuals are going to have to pay more out of pocket in one way or another. The same is true for employers. Either employers pay more for a really good health care package, but that takes something out of the employer's bottom line, or they're putting more costs onto workers in the form of higher deductibles and higher copays.\nAnd I think that a lot of the good work that can be done in lowering costs had to do not with costs shifting, but with actually making the system work better. And we've done a lot of work on that. What I referred to earlier, incentivizing a system that instead of ordering five tests because doctors and providers are getting paid for the test, you now have a system where you're going to get reimbursed if the person gets healthy quicker and is not returned to the hospital. Well, it turns out that that can, over time, be a real cost reduction.\nThose are the kinds of things that we're implementing in the system as a consequence of Obamacare. The more we do that kind of stuff the less we're going to see this cost shifting. But the intention has never been to say let's make it more expensive for people to get health care so they're going to access the system more. And I think the proof of that is, is that even though per-person costs have not gone up a lot, the overall spending on health care has gone up because more people have come into the system.\nWe want people to use the health care system. We just don't want them to use it in the emergency room. We want them to use it to stay healthy and smoking cessation plans and making sure that they're getting regular checkups and mammograms, those are the things that are ultimately going to save us as much money as we can.\nMs. Kliff. I have a wonky follow-up question.\nThe President. There you go. [Laughter] Of course.\nMs. Kliff. Since this is a wonk fest. What about controlling prices? We have some of the highest health care prices in the world in the United States. Most other developed countries, they regulate how much you can charge for an MRI, for an emergency room visit, for an appendectomy. That seems like it's really at the core of this tension, the fact that we have these very high prices. Americans don't go to the doctor more, we just pay a lot more when we go to the doctor.\nThe President. Right.\nMs. Kliff. That is something the health care law did not tackle. And I'm curious to hear you reflect on that and what you would think about the role of price controls in American medicine.\nThe President. Well, look, this is the irony of this whole debate, is the things that people are most dissatisfied with about Obamacare, about the Affordable Care Act, are things that essentially in other countries are solved by more government control, not less. [Laughter]\nMs. Kliff. Yes.\nThe President. And so Republicans are pointing at these things to stir up dissatisfaction, but when it comes to, all right, what's the solution for it, their answer is less government regulation and letting folks charge even more and doing whatever they want and letting the marketplace work its will.\nI think that there are strengths to our system because we have a more market-based system. Our health care system is more innovative. Prescription drugs is probably the best example of this. It is true that we essentially come up with the new drugs in this country, because our drug companies are fat and wealthy enough that they can invest in the research and development. They make bigger profits, which they can, then, plow back into drug development. And essentially, we have a lot of other countries that are free riders on that system. So they can negotiate with the drug companies and force much lower prices, but they generally don't have a drug industry that develops new drugs.\nThat's true. This is an example of where you probably do want some balance to maintain innovation, but to have some tougher negotiations around the system as a whole. And we are trying to use Medicare as the place where, since there's no health care provider or stakeholder in the health care industry that doesn't in some ways want to get Medicare business, we're trying to use Medicare as a lever to get better deals for consumers and better prices for consumers, not just those in Medicare, but also people throughout the system.\nBut as I said, the irony is, is that when we tried to do that the people who are most resistant are the very Republican Members of Congress who are criticizing us or at least telling the American people that you should want lower prices on various procedures.\nIf we want to control prices for consumers more, then the marketplace by itself will not do that. And the reason is because health care is not exactly like other products. It's not like buying a flat-screen TV. If you're sick, or if your kid is sick, most of the time you're not in a position to negotiate right there and then. You can't walk out of the store and just say, well, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. You're trying to figure out—like when Sasha got meningitis when she was 4 months old—make my child better, and that's all—and I'll worry about the costs later. And that's the mentality that most people have when it goes into health care.\nSo the traditional models of the marketplace don't work perfectly in the health care system. There are areas where we can increase marketplace competition. There are ways in which we can make it work better. But ultimately, if we want to really get at some of these costs, there has to be some more extensive regulation in certain areas than we currently have.\nMs. Kliff. So I recently took a trip to an area of Kentucky—on a slightly different topic—that saw some huge coverage gains under the health care law, but also voted overwhelmingly for President-elect Trump. And one of the people I met there was Kathy Oller, who is here with us today. She is an Obamacare enrollment worker who has signed up more than a thousand people for coverage. She supported you in 2008 and 2012, but voted for President-elect Trump in 2016 and expects him to improve on the Affordable Care Act. And she would like to ask you a question about that.\nThe President. Go ahead, Kathy. Is it working?\nCorbin, KY, resident Kathy Oller. I don't know. [Laughter] Let's see if it's on.\nThe President. Yes, it's on.\nMr. Klein. Yes, it looks on.\nMs. Kliff. All right.\nMs. Oller. Oh, okay, I'm close to karaoke now. [Laughter] Hello, President Obama. And I'm so excited to meet you.\nThe President. It's good to see you.\nMs. Oller. Thanks. I'm a little bit nervous, as you could see. But over the years, I've enrolled and talked to numerous Kentuckians, and I've signed up some for even the first time, so it was working, the Affordable Care Act. And also we've been, going over the years, and I've talked to people. But recently, we found out that there was fewer choices in our area, and the increase in the premiums and deductibles, and our facilities aren't even taking some of them. And many Kentuckians now are looking at the Affordable Care as unaffordable and unusable. And I have the opportunity to ask you a few questions that you have probably went over, but how do you think this happened? How can we fix it? Do we start all over again? What do you think we should do?\nThe President. Good. Well, first of all, Kathy, I want to thank you for being out there enrolling people.\nMs. Oller. Thank you.\nThe President. That's been hugely important. And the second point I would make is that Kentucky is a place where this has really worked, and it's worked for two reasons.\nOne is, Kentucky expanded Medicaid. And we haven't talked a lot about that, but a big chunk of Obamacare was just making Medicaid accessible to more people. And those States that expanded Medicaid have seen a much bigger drop in the uninsured than those States who didn't.\nAnd by the way, those States that didn't, they didn't do so just out of politics—I'll just be very blunt—because the Federal Government was going to pay for this Medicaid expansion. And States—there are some States, because they had all this uncompensated care, ended up making money by providing more health insurance to your people. It was a hard bargain—a hard deal to turn down, and yet you've got a number of States that turned it down mainly because Republican Governors and Republican State legislatures didn't want to make it work.\nKentucky, under Steve Beshear was one of those people that did expand Medicaid, had a really active program. Because I don't poll that well in Kentucky—[laughter]—they didn't call it Obamacare, they called it Connect—Kentucky Connect, right? [Laughter]\nAudience member. Kynect.\nThe President. Kynect, right. And so there were a whole lot of people who said, well, we don't like Obamacare—[Laughter]—but I like this program and we'll signed you up, right? You signed people up, you didn't tell them it was Obamacare all the time. [Laughter] And it's actually worked. Right?\nNow, what is true in Kentucky, though, is true in some other States. You had a Governor who ran explicitly on the idea of rolling back Obamacare even though it was working. And so the State marketplace, the State exchange he dismantled, which means we had to shift everything onto the Federal exchange. Most people got shifted, but it indicated a lack of interest and effort on his part in making the thing work. He promised to roll back Medicaid, but he started realizing that wasn't as good politics as he thought it was when he was running, so he hasn't done that.\nBut what is also true is—and this is my main criticism of Obamacare, of the Affordable Care Act—is that the subsidies aren't as high as they probably should be for a lot of working people. If you don't qualify for Medicaid where you don't have to pay, for the most part, for your coverage, and instead, you're buying health insurance on the marketplace—so you're a working person, but you don't have a lot of money—and particularly if you are older, where you use the health care system more and you need a better benefit package than somebody 18 or 20 might, then there are families where the premiums are still too high.\nAnd as I said earlier, there are some parts of the country where there are only a handful of hospitals and a few doctors, and where you don't have a lot of competition, and the insurers are looking, and they're saying, I'm—we're not going to make a lot of money there, so you don't end up having a lot of insurance plans in those areas.\nSo the two things that we could do that would really make it work even better for people in Kentucky would be, number one, provide more subsidies to folks who are working hard every day, but still find the premiums even with the subsidies hard to meet, and have the public option for those communities where they're not getting a lot of competition and insurers aren't coming in.\nThe problem is, is that that's not what's being proposed by Mitch McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky. Instead, what he's proposing, I gather, is you're going to repeal the law, then you're going to come up with something, except you will have taken away all the—the way we pay for the subsidies for working people is, we're taxing wealthier folks at a little bit higher. So he wants to cut those taxes, and that money is going to—that money would be gone right away. And then, he's going to promise you, or those people who you've been signing up, better health care, except there's not going to be any money to pay for it. And nobody has explained to me yet how that's going to work. [Laughter]\nAnd so I think this takes me back to the point I made earlier. If in fact the people you've been signing up, the folks in your communities, are not fully satisfied with the benefits that they're getting now and are hopeful for something better, then at the very least, you should be putting pressure on your Members of Congress to say, show us exactly what the deal is going to be for us before you take away the deal that we've got. Because the people you sign up for, they may not be as happy as they'd like, but—tell me if I'm wrong—they like it better than not having any insurance at all.\nMs. Oller. Sure. And some never even had insurance.\nThe President. And some people didn't have insurance. And finally—because I get letters from folks who say, for the first time in my life—I have had a bad hip for 15 years and I've been pain-free for the first time because I finally got insurance. Right? So the answer is not for them not to have insurance. And if we go back to a system where they've got to buy it on their own, they're not going to buy it, because they'll have even less subsidy.\nHow much time do we got?\nMr. Klein. I think we're quite low.\nThe President. We've got low time? Because I've got all kinds of more stuff to say. [Laughter]\nMr. Klein. Well, it's your schedule. We're happy to keep you as long as you'd like. But——\nThe President. Well, why don't you—there are a couple points I want to make in closing——\nMr. Klein. Excellent.\nThe President .——but why don't you ask some questions.\nMr. Klein. So one thing we haven't touched on yet in much detail is the delivery system reforms, which are a big part of the law. So what is a policy or experiment or change in that space that has overperformed your expectations? And what's one that has maybe not panned out as you'd liked or hoped?\nThe President. You know, I think a good example of something that's worked better than we expected or at least worked as well as we expected is the issue of hospital readmissions. Now, it turns out that a lot of times you go to the hospital, let's say, you get your appendix taken out, and then you go home, and then there's a complication, and then you have to go back into the hospital. That's obviously inconvenient for you, and it's expensive for the system as a whole. And it turns out that there are just a few things that you can do that help reduce people being readmitted.\nFirst of all, making sure that the first procedure goes well, but secondly, making sure that there's good follow-up. So it might be that a hospital or a health care system pays for, when you do go home, you just getting some phone calls to remind you to take the medicine that you've got to take to make sure you heal properly, because if—they may have done a study, and it turns out that people forget to do what they're supposed to do, they don't follow exactly their doctor's instructions, and they can't afford to have a nurse in their house who's doing it for them. Well, maybe there are just some—a few things that can be done to help make sure that they do what they are supposed to do, and that way they don't have complications.\nWhat we've seen is a significant reduction in hospital readmissions over the course of this law just by doing some smart incentivizing, just saying to the hospitals we'll reimburse you or we'll give you some other benefit for doing smart follow-up. That's an area where I think we've made some real progress.\nThe other place—and this is connected—where I think we've got some good bipartisan support is just encouraging what's called—shifting from what's called fee-for-service payments, where you get paid by the procedure, which means that you may end up getting five tests instead of getting one test that's e-mailed to five providers who are treating you. And we've started to see some real movement when we say to the system as a whole we're going to pay you for outcomes: Did the patient do well? And that has been helpful.\nIn terms of areas where I think we haven't seen as much improvement as I'd like, it's probably—one thing that comes to mind is on the electronic medical records. Given—if you think about how wired and plugged in everybody is now—I mean, you can basically do everything off your phone. The fact that there are still just mountains of paperwork—[laughter]—and you don't understand what these bills are that still get sent to your house, and nobody—and the doctors still have to input stuff, and the nurses are spending all their time on all this administrative work—we put a big slug of money into trying to encourage everybody to digitalize, catch up with the rest of the world here.\nAnd it's proven to be harder than we expected, partly because everybody has different systems, they don't all talk to each other. It requires retraining people in how to use them effectively. And I'm optimistic that over time it's inevitable that it's going to get better, because every other part of our lives, it's become paperless. But it's been a lot slower than I would have expected.\nAnd some of it has to do with the fact that, as I said, it's decentralized and everybody has different systems. In some cases, you have, sort of, economic incentives that are pushing against making the system work better. For example, there are service providers—people make money on keeping people's medical records, and then—so making it easier for everybody to access each other's medical records means that there are some folks who could lose business. And that has turned out to be a little more complicated than I expected.\nMs. Kliff. Do you have any closing remarks? And one thing I'm interested in is, kind of, what you see your role in this debate we're gearing up for as.\nThe President. Well, let me make a couple of closing remarks. Number one, I think it is important to remember that just because people campaigned on repealing this law, it is a much more complicated process to repeal this law than I think was being presented on the campaign trail, as my Republican friends are discovering.\nThe way this process is going to work, there's this rushed vote that's taking place this week, next week to—quote, unquote—\"repeal Obamacare.\" But really all that is, is it's a resolution that is then instructing these committees in Congress to start actually drafting a law that specifically would say what's being repealed and what's not. Then, after that, they'd have to make a decision about what's going to replace it and how long is that going to take. And that stretches the process out further. And so I think, whether you originally supported Obamacare or you didn't, whether you like me or you don't, the one thing I would just ask all the American people to do is adopt the slogan of the great State of Missouri: \"Show me.\" [Laughter] Show me. Do not rush this process.\nAnd to Republicans, I would say: What are you scared of? You should—if you are absolutely convinced, as you have been adamant about for the last 7 years, that you can come up with something better, go ahead and come up with it. And I'll even cut you some slack for the fact that you've been saying you'd come up with something better for 7 years and I've never seen it. [Laughter] But we'll restart the clock.\nIt's interesting that we're here in Blair House because this is a place where I met, in front of the American people, with Republicans who had already indicated their adamant opposition to health care. And I sat with them for a couple hours—how long was it?\nFormer Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Eight.\nThe President. Eight hours. [Laughter] Kathleen Sebelius, who was my Secretary of Health and Human Services, remembers—for 8 hours, on live TV, to talk about here's why we're trying to do what we're doing here, and challenging them to come up with better answers than the ones we had come up with. And we spent a year of really significant debate.\nAnd I would think that given that we now have proof that 20 million people do have health insurance, that we're at the lowest rate of uninsured in our history, that health care costs, rather than spiking way up, have actually gone up slower than they have in 50 years; given that the vast majority of people who get health insurance through Obamacare have said they're satisfied with their care and that they're better off than when they didn't have care; given that even though a lot of people don't know it, even if you're not getting health insurance through Obamacare, you've benefited, because if you get health insurance on the job, it now doesn't have a lifetime limit, it doesn't have fine print that could end up costing you a lot of money—given all those things, I would think that you'd at least want to explain to the American people what it is that you want to do. And that, I think, is a minimum expectation out of this Congress and out of the President-elect.\nI'd make a second point, and that is that we just worked, on a bipartisan basis, to sign something called the Cures bill that included two really important bipartisan priorities. One was Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot initiative—because we're seeing so many medical breakthroughs in so many areas that we have an opportunity to make a real dent in how we deal with cancer, which affects everybody in some fashion—somebody has been touched in their—in your family with this terrible disease. So we got a lot more money for research in that, and the bill also contained a big investment in opioid—the opioid challenge.\nAs many of you know, you're seeing more and more communities that are being ravaged by, initially, prescription drugs; then that ends up being a gateway into heroin, some of which, like synthetic heroin being produced called fentanyl, just has terrible rates of overdose deaths. And this is not an inner-city problem, per se, but this is reaching every community. In some ways, it's worse in a lot of rural communities.\nSo there was a bipartisan effort for us to put some more money into that. But here's the thing. If we just put money into cancer research, and we just put money into dealing with the opioid crisis, and now we're taking away money that is providing drug treatment services in those very same communities by repealing Obamacare, and taking away the ability to access a doctor to get new cancer treatments, then we're not really helping anybody. So that's a second point I want to make. A third point I want to make is that I would encourage local communities to get involved in this process. And I think the—part of the problem with this whole law has been that the people who benefit aren't out there making noise, and the people who ideologically have opposed it have been really loud. Well, now is the time for people who have benefited or seen their families benefit to tell their stories.\nBecause, ultimately, this is not a political game. This is really something that affects people in the most personal ways. My friend, Natoma Canfield, is here in the front row. Some of you heard Natoma's story before, where—a cancer survivor who, because she had now a preexisting condition, was faced with either keeping her health insurance at such a high rate—the only way she could get health insurance with a preexisting condition was to basically pay so much that she could no longer afford to pay the mortgage on her house.\nAnd I remember her writing to me, and I thought, that could be my mom. That could be yours. And that's not a choice that people should have to make. And when most people, even if they're not Obama supporters, hear Natoma's story or the stories of other people who have been helped, they know it's wrong to just take away their health care. And it becomes less about who's winning here in Washington. It becomes about, how are we doing right by our fellow Americans?\nBut those stories have to be heard. And I would just encourage people to start telling their stories. And tell their stories—you're not always going to get a lot of attention here in Washington because they want to know this vote and this insult that was hurled back-and-forth between whoever. But you know what, tell that story in your local newspapers. Talk to your local reporters. Congregations that are involved in caring for those in need, make sure that you're telling stories in church and in services so that people know.\nBecause the one thing that I'm convinced about is, the American people want to do the right thing. They just—it's hard to get good information, and unless you're reading Vox every day, which is hard to do——\nMr. Klein. It's not that hard to do. [Laughter]\nThe President. ——getting the details of all this policy is hard. It's complicated. You don't know what's true; you don't know what's not true.\nI mean, those folks in Kentucky that you've signed up—there are a lot of people who voted for not just a President, but also for a Member of Congress who said, explicitly, we're going to eliminate this. Well, I understand why people might think, okay, well, he's going to eliminate it, but he will give us something better. But this is hard. And what you don't want is a situation where they make a promise that they can't keep.\nAnd I've worked on this a long time. If we had had a better way to do this, we would have done it. It would have been in my interest to do it, because I knew I was going to be judged on whether or not it worked. And those areas that don't work have to do with there not being enough money in the system and not having a public option. And I'm more than happy to put those fixes in place, anytime, anyplace. But I—that's not, so far, what the Republicans are proposing. You deserve to know what it is that they're doing.\nSo, anyway, I appreciate you guys taking the time to tell the story.\nMr. Klein. But, real quick, Sarah had asked about your role going forward.\nThe President. Oh, my role going forward?\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Well, look, I mean, I do deserve a little sleep. [Laughter] And I've got to take Michelle on a vacation so—[laughter]. But I've said consistently that the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. And I will be a citizen who still remembers what it was like when his mom died of cancer younger than I am now, and who didn't have all the insurance and disability insurance and support and wasn't using the health care system enough to have early detection that might have prevented her from passing away.\nYou know, Michelle's dad had multiple sclerosis, MS, but was part of that generation that just didn't have a lot of expectations about health care and so just kind of suffered for years. And I mean, those are our stories. So it's not like I'm going to suddenly fade away on this. I will be a part of the work of our fellow citizens in trying to make sure that the wealthiest country on Earth is able to do the same thing that every other advanced country is able to do.\nI mean, it's not as if this has never been done before. You—if you're in Canada, you've got health care, no matter who you are. If you're in France, you've got health care. If you're in England, you've got health care. If you're in Australia, you've got health care. If you're in New Zealand, you've got health care.\nI remember talking to my friend, John Key, who was the Prime Minister of New Zealand. He is part of the Conservative Party in New Zealand. And he said to me in the middle of this health care debate, he said, boy, if I proposed that we took away people's health care, that we repealed it, I'd be run out of office by my own party. [Laughter] Because it was just assumed that, in a country this wealthy that this is one of the basic rights, not privileges, of citizenship in a well-to-do country like ours.\nSo I'll be working with all of you. But my voice is going to be less important than the voices of people who are directly affected. And so I would urge everybody to make your voice heard. Now is the time to do it.\nThe people who have opposed this were opposing it not based on facts, but were opposing it based on, sort of, an ideological concern about expansion of the state and, sort of, taxes on wealthier people that are helping people who don't have as much money. And I respect their role in the democracy. They've been really fighting hard. Well, folks here got to fight just as hard.\nMy final piece of advice would be to the news media, which is, we—generally speaking, when Obamacare has worked well, it wasn't attributed to Obamacare, and when there were problems, they got front-page headlines. And I think that, hopefully, now is a time where people can be a little—this doesn't apply to Vox, by the way. [Laughter] But I think it would be a good time for people to be a little more measured and take a look at what are the facts of this thing. Because the stakes are high.\nEven on this whole premium issue—increase issue that happened right before the election, it is true, as I said, that insurers adjusted and hiked premiums. But I kept on trying to explain, number one, if you're getting a tax subsidy, this wasn't going to affect your out-of-pocket costs because the tax credit would just go up. But nobody kind of heard that.\nAnd number two, these increases in premiums only applied to people who were buying health insurance on the exchanges. In fact, 85 percent of the people don't get health insurance through Obamacare. And for you, your health care premiums actually have gone up a lot less since Obamacare was passed than they did before Obamacare was passed. The average family has probably saved about $3,000 in lower health care premiums than if you had seen those same health care cost trends increased at the pace that they did before the law was passed. But I didn't see a lot of headlines about that, but—which I understand, I mean because it's not controversial enough, or it's a little bit too complicated to get in a soundbite.\nSo that's why the individual voice is so important. And that's why I'm so appreciative of journalists who actually know what they're talking about. Thank you. Mr. Klein. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nMs. Kliff. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-06", "title": "Interview on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act With Ezra Klein and Sarah Kliff of Vox"}

Trump today announced his intention to nominate former United States Senator Dan Coats to serve as the Director of National Intelligence.\nHaving served for years on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, including during the just-completed 114th Congress and previously on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Coats has a keen understanding of the national security threats currently facing our nation and the solutions required to address them.\n\"I'm very confident that Senator Dan Coats is the right choice to serve as Director of National Intelligence,\" said President-elect Trump. \"Dan has clearly demonstrated the deep subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community. If confirmed as Director of National Intelligence, he will provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration's ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.\"\nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, it became apparent that the United States' 16 individual intelligence agencies were not effectively coordinating their efforts, leading to intelligence failures. As a result, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was installed as head of the U.S. Intelligence Community to facilitate the sharing of information, ultimately making it possible to form a more comprehensive threat assessment. The DNI is also responsible for delivering the President's Daily Brief, which fuses intelligence from across various agencies to give the President the most up-to-date information on threats around the world, among other critical responsibilities.\nAs Director of National Intelligence, Sen. Coats will bring decades of experience and profound judgment to the supervision and coordination of America's intelligence efforts. The safety of the American people and security of the American homeland will be his top priorities.\n\"It is an honor to be nominated as Director of National Intelligence,\" said Sen. Coats. \"A robust and responsible intelligence infrastructure is essential to our homeland security, and if confirmed I will ensure our national security decision-makers have every piece of information they need to protect the American people from the threats facing our nation. There is no higher priority than keeping America safe, and I will utilize every tool at my disposal to make that happen.\"\nDan Coats was born in Michigan and earned a B.A. in political science at Wheaton College in Illinois before serving in the U.S. Army from 1966 to 1968. After his military service, Sen. Coats earned a J.D. from the University of Indiana in 1972 and subsequently worked in the private sector. From 1981 to 1989 he served in the U.S. House of Representatives and represented the state of Indiana for a total of 16 years, first from 1989-1999 and then again from 2011-2017. From 2001-2005 Sen. Coats served as the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, arriving three days before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Sen. Coats and his wife Marsha have three children.", "timestamp": "2017-01-07", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

On Tuesday night, in Chicago, I'll deliver mine. I chose Chicago not only because it's my hometown, where I met my wife and we started a family, but also because it's really where my career in public service began.\nThe running thread through my career has been the notion that when ordinary people get involved and get engaged and come together in collective effort, things change for the better. That's the belief at the heart of this precious American experiment in self-government. It's what gives work and purpose to each new generation.\nIt's easy to lose sight of that truth in the day-to-day back and forth of Washington or our minute-to-minute news cycles. But remember that America is a story told over a longer time horizon, in fits and starts, punctuated at times by hardship, but ultimately written by generations of citizens who've somehow worked together, without fanfare, to form a more perfect Union.\nOver the past 8 years, we've added our own new chapter to that story. Together, we've turned an economy that was shrinking and losing jobs into one that's growing and creating jobs, with poverty falling, incomes rising, and wages that have jumped faster over the past few years than at any time in the past four decades.\nTogether, we've achieved what eluded politicians of both parties for a century: We've moved 20 million more Americans from uninsured to insured, ending the days of discrimination against up to half of Americans who have a preexisting condition, and secured new rights and protections for everybody with health insurance.\nTogether, we've brought home most of our brave troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, took bin Laden and thousands of other terrorists off the battlefield for good. We've opened a new chapter with the people of Cuba, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a single shot, and brought the world together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for future generations.\nBy these measures and many more, we have made America a better, stronger place for the generation that follows ours. We've run our leg in a long journey of progress, knowing that our work is and will always be unfinished. And that's the imperative of citizenship: the idea that with hard work, people who love their country can change it. That will be the focus of my Farewell to you this Tuesday, and I hope you'll tune in.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2017-01-07", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120996", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:46 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. I do not have any announcements at the top so we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, would you like to go first?\nQ: Thank you. So over the weekend, Donald Trump's chief of staff said the President-elect now accepts that Russia was behind the hacking of the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. And I was wondering if having Reince Priebus come out and say that Donald Trump now accepts the intelligence community's findings, is that enough for the White House? Or do you think that people need to hear Donald Trump come out and say that himself?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to call on the President-elect to make any statements. Obviously, the American people and the world are watching as he and his team do the work to prepare to take over the most powerful job in the world. And so then obviously this entire process is being closely scrutinized, and it should be. That shouldn't be particularly surprising. That's been true of the 44 other Presidents of the United States and it's not particularly surprising that people are closely watching the 45th President as he prepares to take office.\nAnd obviously the intelligence community has provided a rigorous analysis of the malicious activity carried out by Russia in cyberspace that was intended to interfere with our election. It was intended to harm the prospects of the President-elect's opponent in the election. These are well-established facts, and obviously the world will continue to watch how Mr. Trump and his team -- the President-elect and his team choose to respond.\nQ: The President said in at least one interview last week that he hoped that after Donald Trump was briefed by the intelligence leaders last Friday, that some of the tensions between the President-elect and the intelligence community would ease. So wouldn't that happen if Donald Trump comes out and says, you know, I accept that Russia was behind this? Wouldn't a statement from him sort of contribute to this easing of tensions that the President spoke about last week?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, what President Obama was talking about was his own experience. And what his own experience told President Obama is that he benefitted enormously from the men and women of the United States intelligence community providing him with the best available, most timely information. And the President counted on the intelligence community to provide him information that wasn't shaded to advance any ideological agenda. It was not influenced by politics. And it was presented without any concern that President Obama or anyone on his team was going to exact retribution for the information that was presented. And the President of the United States benefitted from getting an unvarnished assessment from the intelligence community about the state of the world and facts about the state of the world.\nAnd President Obama believed that that improved his decision-making, and he believes that President Trump would benefit from having that kind of relationship with the intelligence community as well.\nQ: On another subject, a couple of years ago, Meryl Streep was here at the White House for the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award. The President talked a lot about how much he loves her. Does he think her speech last night at the Golden Globes was appropriate, that that ceremony was the appropriate venue to talk about Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about her speech. I didn't see her speech, but I certainly read about it. It seemed to get plenty of attention. And I think what I can say is she clearly was delivering a thoughtful, carefully considered message that she believes in deeply. And it seemed to me to be a fairly straightforward exercise of her First Amendment rights as a citizen of the United States.\nQ: Ever since the election, he's been very reluctant to repeat a lot of the criticisms that he lodged against Donald Trump during the campaign.\nMR. EARNEST: And the reason for that is that he's got institutional responsibilities. He's the President of the United States, and once the election is over, his chief responsibility is to ensure a smooth and effective transition to the incoming administration. I'm not aware that the United States Constitution includes any institutional responsibilities for the lifetime award winner of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\nQ: So Hollywood doesn't have to move on?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm suggesting is that American citizens have the opportunity to exercise their right to free speech in any way that they choose. And certainly when it comes to standing up for deeply held values, the American people get to choose how and when and whether to express those sentiments.\nPresident Obama is in a different position because he's got institutional responsibilities. He's got strongly held political views that he frequently and passionately conveyed on the campaign trail, and those views have not changed, as I've said on a number of occasions. But because of his institutional responsibilities as President of the United States to ensure a smooth and effective transition to the next President, he has to set aside those personal feelings in order to preside over an effective transition and give the incoming team every advantage associated with a running start. And the President has faithfully presided over a process that's done exactly that.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. Going on to another topic, Taiwan's President had a stopover in Houston on Sunday, and she met with some Republican lawmakers. I was wondering, what's the White House's response to that, and to the seeming -- these kind of -- I mean, this follows President-elect Trump's phone call with the President of Taiwan. What does the White House make of these actions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the U.S. policy with regard to Taiwan has not changed. And the President and this administration have pursued that one China policy in the same way that previous administrations have because we believe that it best serves the national security interests of the United States. We also happen to believe it serves well the interests of our friends in Taiwan.\nSo I'm not sure whether or not Senator Cruz and his team was acting on behalf of the President-elect. They obviously have a rather unique relationship -- so you'd have to ask them -- ask him that. And obviously the incoming administration will determine whether or not to continue this policy once President-elect Trump takes office on January 20th. But as of now, there's nothing about the meeting that took place over the weekend that in any way changed U.S. policy with regard to Taiwan.\nQ: Does the White House feel that meeting shouldn't have happened? Like, would the White House be supportive -- was the White House supportive of that meeting? Does the White House have a view on that meeting taking place?\nMR. EARNEST: The meeting was one that was arranged at Senator Cruz's own initiative, as far as I know. It certainly wasn't coordinated or encouraged by the administration. And the meeting doesn't have any bearing whatsoever on our continued pursuit of a one China policy that benefits the United States and Taiwan.\nQ: On one more topic. A U.S. Navy destroyer fired three warning shots at some Iranian fast-attack vessels on Sunday, I believe. Can you talk about -- this was the latest incident. There have been a number of these incidents at the -- where there have been kind of aggressive measures and then the U.S. has kind of taken action to kind of stop these aggressive measures happening at sea. I mean, is this a concern, especially as we're about to go -- we're in a transition period, we're about to go to a new presidency? Is Iran -- like, what may be behind these -- what may be behind these incidents and what is your concern that they keep -- that they continue to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, you're wise to point out that this is -- that there is a habit of the Iranian military engaging in these kinds of activities in this particular region around the Strait of Hormuz. And I can tell you that the United States is aware of the latest incident involving Iranian vessels and the USS Mahan. As the Department of Defense has indicated, the actions were unsafe and unprofessional. These, of course, are the actions that were taken by the Iranian vessels.\nAt this point, the United States does not know what the intentions of the Iranian vessel were, but the behavior is not acceptable, given that the USS Mahan was operating in international waters. So these types of actions are certainly concerning and certainly risk escalating tensions. It is our view that we should look for ways to deescalate tensions, not unnecessarily escalate them.\nSo as we've repeatedly noted, the Strait of Hormuz -- as anybody with access to a map can confirm -- is a compressed space, which enhances the likelihood, or at least potential, for miscalculations. And that's certainly something that we would like to avoid.\nSo for additional details on the incident about how it -- for a detailed assessment of what exactly transpired, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. But it certainly is the view of the United States that these kinds of actions are concerning because of the potential that they could unnecessarily escalate tensions.\nQ: So, I mean, obviously -- I mean, this is -- I mean, you guys are at the end of your tenure here, but I mean, President-elect Trump has said that -- has threatened to shoot any Iranian vessel out of the water -- or any Iranian vessel that harasses a U.S. Navy ship will be shot out of the water. I mean, what do you think about those threats? That clearly hasn't been -- this administration's approach has not been to aggressively go back when this harassment has occurred. I guess, what -- do you think that more needs to be done? Or does the administration believe that more is going to need to be done to deal with this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly it is a blanket policy of this administration that U.S. service members have the ability to protect themselves and can exercise that capability when they're threatened directly. But our goal, particularly in this compressed region of the world, is to avoid escalating tensions. And the risk associated with the kinds of actions that we saw from the Iranian vessels is the heightened possibility that tensions could escalate, and that certainly is something that we've gone to great lengths to avoid.\nMichelle.\nQ: Now that Americans have been able to see the report -- the public portion of it, at least -- on the Russian hacking, some of the criticism out there has been that it's not exactly heavy on evidence. And we heard Julian Assange just this morning call it embarrassing. How would you respond to those criticisms?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the report is actually consistent with what the administration and national security and intelligence officials have been saying for months. The analysis that was put forward by the CIA, by the FBI and the NSA makes clear Russia's culpability for these actions. It makes clear what Russia's intent was.\nNow, the unclassified version of the report that was released prioritized the need to inform the American people about what exactly transpired, but there was an urgent priority to protect sources and methods, and make sure that the United States could retain the ability to protect the American people and protect our cyber infrastructure here in the United States. So it means that in order to protect those sources and methods, we were not prepared to make public how exactly each of these pieces of information was known. But the fact that the vast majority of this report includes the high-confidence assessment of the FBI, the CIA and the NSA I think should send a pretty powerful message about just how comprehensive this evidence is.\nAnd again, this is a report that was compiled and put forward by intelligence officials who dedicate their lives to the safety and security of the United States. They are experts in their field. They are not engaged in this activity because it makes them rich, or it makes them fame, or it earns them glory. They do it because they're interested in protecting the country. They're patriots. And all that said, it's not surprising to me that somebody who has become globally infamous for releasing these kinds of secrets may not have a lot of complimentary words to say about the report.\nQ: We've also heard some statements from the Trump team saying that because the hacking activity predated the time when it was clear that Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee, it seems like the intent was to hurt the Democratic side but not necessarily help Donald Trump specifically. Would you agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the report was pretty blunt in indicating the evolving nature of the intent of the Russian operatives who were engaged in this activity. But, look, again, you don't need a security clearance to determine who exactly was harmed by this hack-and-leak strategy and who benefitted from it. So setting the report aside, I think you'd have a really hard time making the case that somehow the Russians were impartial, again, because we know that they hacked Democratic sources and they hacked Republican-affiliated organizations. But the only information that was leaked in the most damaging possible way was the information that was collected from Democrats in a way that I don't think anybody thinks benefitted the Clinton campaign. So at some point, this just isn't all that complicated.\nQ: And this latest rhetoric coming from North Korea that basically anytime and anywhere they can fire off an ICBM, what are you guys making of that? Is this just more bluster? I mean, it's almost become like the typical thing -- every two weeks or so there's another kind of provocative statement. Or are you taking this more seriously than rhetoric?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Obama administration, the United States, and I think the international community take seriously and is concerned about the destabilizing rhetoric and sometimes destabilizing actions that are undertaken by the regime in North Korea. And that's why you've seen the United States lead and international response to mobilize the international community to impose the toughest-ever sanctions that have ever been imposed on North Korea because of our concern about their rhetoric and their actions.\nAnd you also heard the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, over the weekend indicate that the United States military retains significant capability to protect the United States and our allies, and we're prepared to use that capability when necessary. But our preference is to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, deescalate tensions, and bring North Korea back into the community of nations. But right now, because of North Korea's refusal to abide by international obligations when it comes to their nuclear weapons program, they are an outlier, they are excluded, they are isolated in a way that -- certainly more so than any other country in the world.\nJustin.\nQ: I just wanted to kind of return to what Michelle was talking about. Obviously, I think the conclusions made by the different branches of the intelligence community were powerful in their confidence. But it really seemed like there was little, if any, evidence to back up those conclusions, and some of the supplemental material was from reports that was outdated and went back to 2012. There was very little to show how the information that was hacked by the Russians got to Wikileaks. Those kinds of connections weren't made. Did you guys do yourselves a disservice here by not including a little -- obviously, there could have been more things that were disclosed without violating sources and methods here. I think that's apparent as sort of the things that you point to as apparent here. Couldn't there have been more granted, and doesn't this give critics more ammunition to sort of discount the report?\nMR. EARNEST: I think critics of this report have a very tough row to hoe here. I think any fair-minded individual would take a look at this report that was put forward by the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA and conclude that they feel quite strongly about the conclusions that they have reached and publicized. I think any fair-minded individual would understand the careful concern that was taken to protect sources and methods.\nThis is obviously a threat that exists in cyberspace that persists and has the potential to get worse before it gets better. And that means these intelligence agencies need to protect the ability of the United States to monitor, detect, and deter these kinds of activities. And that means that we're not able to make public all of the evidence in place. But the fact that this is a report that is consistent with the statement that was issued by all 17 intelligence agencies of the United States government back in October, the fact that that initial statement was delivered by all 17 intelligence agencies with high confidence, and the fact that this is a report that these agencies stand behind I think is notable.\nAnd I think that your desire and the desire of the American public for more information is certainly understandable and one that I anticipated. Plenty of other people did, too. And that's why the President asked these experts to make as much public as was possible even as they protect the ability of the United States to protect ourselves in cyberspace -- not just from the Russians, but from other malicious activities -- from malicious hackers.\nQ: Sure. Even people who agree that Russia was responsible for the hack have -- who are critics of the administration have pointed to this sort of entire enterprise and said, okay, we knew this before the election. Hillary Clinton talked about it every day. Donald Trump was asked about it. And so this sort of process was an effort by the White House to politically harm or delegitimize Donald Trump by resurfacing the allegations that we've known for a long time. And as you said, we've known since October or whatever it was. So I guess without the component of additional evidence to back up the claims, what did we learn on Friday that we didn't already know, or that would sort of help people, I guess, act on this to shield themselves in the future that we didn't know beforehand to sort of answer that criticism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess, Justin, the best piece of evidence I would point to you about the powerful nature of the report is the changing response from the President-elect and his team.\nQ: Well, now, that's not true, because he got a -- so there was the declassified, the classified that Congress will get, and then an even higher level that the President and President-elect received?\nMR. EARNEST: Right.\nQ: So there -- inevitably he could have received that higher level briefing without the sort of public report and pressure from --\nMR. EARNEST: So you're suggesting we should have put together this highly classified report and not release any details? I think the context of this questioning would be quite a bit different if that were the case.\nQ: No, I think you should have released more details.\nMR. EARNEST: And what I'm telling you is that the experts in the international community released as many details as they possibly could without risking sources and methods.\nSo, again, I think your interest in wanting to know more about what happened is understandable and not surprising giving the kind of intellectual interest you typically show in these kinds of briefings. So I'm not surprised by that. But I think any other fair-minded person would understand that these are capabilities and resources that the United States government uses to protect the American people and they're critical to our national security, so we can't burn our sources here. And I think that is a reasonable and responsible conclusion. And what the international community tried to do is provide as much information as they could even as they were protecting sources and methods.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. John Kerry is issuing an apology on behalf of the State Department for past mistreatment of his LGBT employees. Is this going to be a government-wide thing? Should we expect to see other heads of agencies come out and offer the same sentiment?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of additional plans by other agencies, but certainly I wouldn't rule it out either.\nQ: So this wasn't directed by the President? He didn't say at a Cabinet meeting, by the way, let's look at this possible?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is -- obviously, the decision that was made by Secretary Kerry today in his statement today is entirely consistent with the President's view of these issues and certainly is entirely consistent with some of the work that the President and his administration have done in the United States military at the Department of Defense with regard to Americans that have previously been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. So this is obviously consistent with the kinds of values that the President has given voice to. But this is a decision that was made the Secretary of State.\nQ: Pakistan said that it's tested its first sub-launched cruise missile. I'm wondering if the administration, specifically the White House has a reaction to that.\nMR. EARNEST: I hadn't seen those reports, Olivier. So let me look into it and we'll get back to you.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. There are a lot of nomination hearings this week. And I'm wondering, now that Republicans think obstruction is a bad thing, if you think Democrats should allow those nominations to go forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it's not just obstruction they think is a bad thing. Apparently they think that background checks are bad, too.\nI just want to read from a February 2009 letter that was signed the Honorable Mitch McConnell, Republican leader of the United States Senate. And he sent it to Harry Reid, the Democratic then Majority Leader of the United States Senate. The letter says in part:\n\"We reaffirm our commitment to conduct the appropriate review of these nominations consistent with the longstanding and best practices of committees regardless of which political party is in the majority. These best practices serve the Senate well, and we will insist on their fair and consistent application.\"\nSo we can provide all of you copies of this letter. It's significant because it lays out eight different principles that they believe are critical to ensure the fair consideration of presidential nominees. And it includes things like ensuring that an FBI background check is complete and submitted to the committee in time for review and prior to a hearing being noticed. It also notes, conspicuously, the Office of Government Ethics letter should be complete and submitted to the committee in time for review prior to a committee hearing.\nThis, of course, is very different than the approach that Republicans are taking with regard to President-elect Trump's nominees.\nWhat I can tell you is that the Obama administration never asked for a nominee to get a hearing in the United States until their Office of Government Ethics letter was complete. That is to say, until the Office of Government Ethics, the independent watchdog of the United States government had completed their review to ensure that ethical conflicts had been resolved.\nThat was a principle that we abided by for eight years. So I can tell you that it does appear that now Republicans in the Senate are forming their own cheap suit caucus -- and it's a not commentary on their wardrobe, it's a commentary on the fact that they are folding like a --\nQ: Like a cheap suit --\nMR. EARNEST: -- and rubber-stamping -- thanks for following along -- and rubber-stamping the nominees of the incoming Trump administration --\nQ: What happens when you rubber-stamp a cheap suit? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I guess we're going to find out. But I think it's --\nQ: Sounds horrible.\nMR. EARNEST: I think that what we've seen here is that the Republicans in the Senate are failing in their effort to advise and consent. Coming on the heels of the debacle that we saw in the House where House Republicans engineered an effort to gut ethical guidelines on the House, it sounds like a lot of Americans who voted to drain the swamp aren't getting what they hoped for even before their guy takes office.\nAndrew.\nQ: Back to Russia. You've obviously found that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election. I'm wondering if you've ruled out the possibility that Russia recruited American citizens to that effort, or American citizens were knowingly conspiring with Russia in that regard.\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, I don't recall having seen anything like that in the unclassified version of the report. For information that may be included in the classified version, I'd refer you to the intelligence community. I have not read the classified version. But if there is more analysis that the intelligence community has to share, you'll have to check with them directly.\nQ: And the report named Putin personally. Why is he not facing sanctions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we've discussed a couple of times, it is rather extraordinary for the United States to decide to sanction the leader of another country. I would hastily acknowledge that Russia's activities with regard to the 2016 election were extraordinary. But obviously there are a range of factors that go into decisions about who merits sanctioning. And I think the decision by the United States government to sanction a couple of these Russian government and military entities and some of the -- at least one or two companies that assisted them in this effort I think does reflect the significance of the concern that we have about Russia's activities in cyberspace.\nAnd I would point out that this is activity -- or I'm sorry -- this is a response that is available to the U.S. government because of the foresight demonstrated by this administration and this President to grant in advance authority to the Secretary of Treasury to use financial sanctions as a potential response to malicious cyber activity. So this does represent the implementation of a strategy. And I think, by and large, most people, including the President-elect's team would acknowledge that the response from the Obama administration has been serious.\nAnd you'll recall that since this intelligence community assessment about the malicious Russian cyber activity was made public, we indicated that we were aiming for a proportionate response. And while we have not detailed every element of that response, those elements that are public I think gives you a pretty good indication of just how seriously we treat this matter.\nQ: Just a final question. Do you have any reaction to Rafsanjani's death? Do you think it has any impact on the nuclear deal or Iranian government's policy or position?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by acknowledging that former President Rafsanjani was a prominent figure throughout the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And the United States sends our condolences to his family and loved ones. He was a consequential figure inside Iran. But for what potential impact this could have on Iranian policy I wouldn't speculate.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you give me and update on the President's latest conversation with Turkey's President and the latest on the Gulen story? I haven't heard if there's an ongoing investigation into whether or not he will be repatriated to that country. Can you give us an update on it?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, as you'll recall, the President did have an opportunity to talk to President Erdo?an last week. The President called to offer his condolences on behalf of the American people to the Turkish people for the many deaths at the Turkish nightclub on New Year's Eve.\nTurkey is obviously a critically important NATO ally of the United States. And despite our occasional differences, we value the strong partnership that we have with Turkey, particularly when it comes to protecting the national security of citizens of both of our countries. And President Obama has dedicated a significant portion of his presidency to strengthening the NATO alliance, including the ability of the United States to work closely with Turkey to protect our national security.\nWith regard to Mr. Gulen, the Department of Justice has, for a number of months now, been working closely with their Turkish counterparts to determine what sort of evidence is available to support the petition for his extradition that was issued by the Turkish government. I haven't gotten a recent update on that effort, but I know how seriously the Department of Justice was undertaking that effort, so I'd refer you to them for an update.\nQ: Is it your expectation that that would be something that could possibly be wrapped up before the President leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what the time frame is for completing that investigation. Obviously, this is an investigation that was going to be conducted jointly with Turkish officials, and it was going to develop evidence pursuant to the extradition treaty that exists between the United States and Turkey and has for some time. But I don't know what the time frame is for completing that work.\nQ: I don't want to step on the speech itself, but I'd love to get a readout of your expectation of the President's comments in Chicago. And in particular, do you expect him to address at least at the micro level why some of the successes that he's had at the macro level have not sort of translated down into the city of Chicago, in particular in the African American community, which has just been hit by such devastation in terms of violence, et cetera?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the first thing I can confirm for you is there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the speech. So the President will be doing a lot of thinking between now and then, between now and 9:00 p.m. Eastern tomorrow, thinking about what he wants to say and what sort of presentation he wants to make to the American public as he enters the last couple of weeks that he has here at the White House.\nI can tell you, in general, that the President is committed to delivering a forward-looking speech that will examine briefly the significant progress that our country has made in the last eight years. But it will take a closer look and he'll spend more time talking about what the President believes is necessary for us to confront the challenges that lie ahead.\nAnd most of those solutions, in the mind of the President, rest on the deeply held values that just about every American subscribes to. And those values include fairness and justice. It includes the idea that, if you work hard, you should have the opportunity to succeed regardless of what you look like, or what your last name is, or who you love. And the President believes that obviously the diversity of this country is a strength and that, for all our differences, there's much more that unites us than separates us. And our country is stronger when we remember that principle and we draw upon those common values.\nBut the President will have some more to say about this tomorrow night and is really looking forward to the opportunity to address the American people one last time.\nQ: And I also want to ask -- great interview with my colleagues over at GMA. Tthe President seemed very candid about his time not just remaining in office but also sort of looking ahead to what may lie on the agenda for Democrats looking forward. And he seemed to be suggesting in his interview that the principles and the ideas as you've just laid them out resonated with a great many Americans but they were unable to -- the party was not able to convince enough Americans that they were the right ideas.\nHe seemed to suggest that, well, they voted for me. And I kind of took that to say, you know, if I were out there, we would have won this battle. Am I reading too much into that comment? And was it a matter of messaging or was it a matter of the messenger?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has made the case, in a variety of settings that the kinds of values and agenda and priorities that he's laid out over the last eight years continue to enjoy the strong support of the vast majority of the American public. And that's true when you consult public opinion polls that rate the President of the United States higher than every other politician in America, and higher than most other Presidents at this stage in their presidency. So I think that is an indication of the strong support that the American people continue to have for his agenda and for his priorities and for his message.\nI think the fact that President Obama was campaigning so aggressively for Secretary Clinton, somebody -- she was the candidate that got the most votes in the last election. Now, she didn't win, but if you're just looking for public support for the message that President Obama was helping her communicate, it's clear that that was a message that resonated deeply with the American people. Not sufficiently enough to win the Electoral College, of course, but I think it is an indication of just how deeply the President's message and his agenda resonates with the American public.\nAnd the President himself has made the observation -- and this is an observation that all of you have made in the context of other elections, 2010 and 2014 in particular -- that despite the President's best efforts, the President's message did not succeed in motivating enough people to participate in those elections when the President wasn't on the ballot. But obviously, in 2008 and 2012, when Barack Hussein Obama was at the top of the ticket, we saw the American people respond in kind with a majority of support. So I think that's an indication of the President standing with the American public and the strong support for his agenda.\nBut there are questions that he and other Democrats need to answer about what it is that our party can do to ensure that these priorities and these values and this agenda resonates even when the top line of the ticket doesn't have Obama on it.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to the speech. How much of this speech is directed to those who are trying to rewrite this President's history -- those who dismiss things like the fact that Osama bin Laden is no more, those who dismiss the fact that his -- more efforts to look at the issues of criminal justice reform, those people who also don't like the inclusion of same sex marriage. Is this an effort to rewrite history, and also focused at those people, the naysayers, to his accomplishments?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The President is primarily delivering a message to the American people -- all Americans, whether they voted for President Obama or not. The President feels an obligation to talk about what he's learned over the last eight years, what he's learned about the country, what he's learned about governing the country, and offer up his advice to the American people about the most effective way to confront the challenges that we see ahead.\nSo that's the goal. And there certainly -- the President certainly could give a long speech reciting the many accomplishments of his administration, but that's not how he's choosing to spend his time tomorrow night.\nQ: So how long is the speech? You're talking about several drafts -- it's almost sounding like a State of the Union kind of thing, where you have the drafts, you go through the drafts and the rewrites. Is it something like that? Would you equate it to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not. It will be shorter and much different in style.\nQ: So, okay, how much shorter? I mean, is it going to be like half an hour, less, more?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll try to give you some guidance tomorrow. I don't have one to share.\nQ: No, I mean, I'm serious because --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm serious, too. The message of the speech hasn't been completed yet. So we'll give you some updated timing tomorrow.\nQ: And lastly, is this more heart or is it more policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what you can expect from the President is a heartfelt expression of gratitude to the American people for the trust they've shown in him, and a carefully considered collection of thoughts about the challenges that lie ahead and the most effective way for the United States of America to successfully confront them.\nQ: And how many drafts is this now?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a number to share with you on that.\nQ: Is it more than five? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a number to share with you on that.\nStephanie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back to Russia. It seems as though Russia is still aiming to ensure a Trump-Putin meeting takes place early in the new U.S. presidency. Is this concerning at all, considering the President has made a point to say that we are not on the same team?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama has met with President Putin on a number of occasions, so I think it's entirely appropriate that the President of the United States would meet with the President of Russia. President Obama agreed to participate in those meetings at a time and place of his choosing. And obviously the incoming President will make his own determination about the appropriate location and about the appropriate timing of those meetings.\nQ: And Jared Kushner, President-elect Donald Trump's sone-in-law, has been named senior advisor in the administration. And we know Kushner has been one of the most influential voices during the campaign. Does this raise any questions? What is the White House's reaction to this? Are there any questions of -- maybe legal and ethical questions because of the family ties?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there are a number of these kinds of questions that have been raised. I'll let President-elect Trump select whomever he would like to have around him. Obviously that's what he will do.\nWhat I can tell you is that President Obama and all of those of us who served on his senior staff here in the White House went to great lengths to comply with the strict ethical requirements that the American people expect of people who are entrusted with so much authority. And President Obama takes great pride in the fact that there has not been a major scandal over the eight years that he's been in office.\nAnd at least some of that is attributable to the willingness of the people who serve in positions of authority both in the White House and across the federal government to not just abide by the ethical requirements put in place by the Office of Government Ethics, and not just abide by the letter of the law when it comes to ethics, but actually aspire to a higher standard.\nAnd that was a standard that was set by President Obama himself who, when he took office, essentially liquidated his assets and put them into the Treasury bills. I've noted on a number of occasions that that was not a particularly wise investment decision because this was a time when interest rates were being slashed, but it was the right decision for the country, because it meant that questions about the President's potential motivation were put to rest because he didn't have a financial interest in these policies, rather his only interest was in the success of the American people, American middle-class workers and the American economy.\nLynn.\nQ: Thank you. Going back to the tomorrow event, just for some housekeeping, we know that Vice President Biden and the First Lady and Dr. Biden will be there. Will they also be speaking or introducing?\nMR. EARNEST: They will not.\nQ: So when the President talks about the work ahead, what of his legacy organizations might he be thinking about? What fill can you give me? Is this OFA? Is this an entity to be created by the center? What is the vehicle then that you see him carrying out the forward-looking things he wants to talk about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't -- when the President is giving his speech tomorrow he's not going to have in mind his own --\nQ: I'm not asking you to tell me if it's in the speech. I'm asking you to tell me what the \"it\" is, if you know.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess it's hard to answer that question. I think what I would tell you is the President intends to lay out his own view about the challenges facing the country and the most effective way for the United States to overcome them. I'll let the President speak at a later date about what sort of activities he'll be engaged in after he leaves the White House to address some of those challenges.\nQ: Do you happen to know, will he be swinging by the Obama alumni event taking place also at McCormick Place?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll keep you posted on the President's schedule. I'm not sure exactly what all he'll do while he's there, but we'll certainly keep you posted.\nHans.\nQ: If I could follow on that February 2009 letter on OGE.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: How important for this administration, back at that time or throughout, was the OGE process. Did you guys ever learn anything new that made you reconsider a nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I don't think I would say that -- off the top of my head I certainly can't think of a scenario.\nQ: Did the disclosures about Richardson come out in the OGE letter, or a separate investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: That's ancient history, as far as I'm concerned. I guess what -- I think what I can tell you is that the standard that the Obama administration lived up to was a standard of ensuring that that OGE ethics letter arrangement was complete before these individuals got a hearing before the United States Congress.\nQ: So it was more protocol. It wasn't like you guys learned additional stuff that you didn't pick up in your own vetting.\nMR. EARNEST: It's certainly possible that there would have been additional information that was unearthed as a result of those kinds of things. I think the more important thing here, Hans, is not just the background vetting, but also the arrangements that are put in place to ensure that conflicts of interest are eliminated. And that is what the Office of Government and Ethics can verify, is, what can we do to make sure that this individual doesn't have some sort of ethical conflict of interest or financial conflict of interest.\nThe irony here is that a number of questions have been raised about the nominees put forward by the President-elect with regard to their financial conflict of interest. That's why it's particular egregious that Republicans in the United States Congress who previously had so aggressively advocated for ensuring that these ethical arrangements were completed before these hearings were held are now agreeing to hold hearings for nominees that do have obvious financial conflicts of interest that have been widely reported even though they haven't undertaken the reasonable steps to deal with them.\nAnd again, coupled with the decision by House Republicans to make their first act as the incoming majority in Congress to vote in secret to gut ethics regulations, it certainly has to arouse some concern around those Americans who voted to drain the swamp when they voted for Donald Trump.\nQ: It just -- on the timing of it, though, was it fairly fast? Do you guys ever -- do you remember any delays? Like was it -- was the process smooth?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly those of us who worked in the Communications Office would have liked to have seen this process move more quickly. But when you're trying to move a bunch of nominees through at the same time, in some cases -- particularly in the case of the President-elect's nominees, some of them have extensive financial holdings. So I guess the point that I would make is it's worth the time to make sure that the kinds of ethical arrangements are in place to prevent conflicts of interest from cropping up.\nAnd given the fact that there were no major ethical scandals in this administration, I think that's an indication that we pursued the right path. It certainly is the path that was recognized -- recommended by Mitch McConnell eight years ago. But now he and the rest of the Republicans are poised to fold like a cheap suit.\nQ: Just one quick -- I'm sorry for stepping on your metaphor earlier -- you had it all lined up.\nMR. EARNEST: That's okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: When you look at what the President is directly saying -- because you guys have held back a little bit in terms of, like, giving direct advice -- it is the President's view that no nominee should be heard before they have the letter from OGE.\nMR. EARNEST: What the President has said is that is the standard that we have maintained, and it's served him and the American people and his administration very well, as evidenced by the fact in eight years we did not have a major ethical scandal while he was President.\nSteven.\nQ: Just to button one thing down with respect to the intelligence community's declassified report -- when he testified on the Hill last week, Director Clapper said that there would be a declassified version released sometime early this week, but it came out Friday, timed relatively close to the President-elect's briefing. Was that a decision that was made here in the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: It was not. That was a decision that was made entirely by the authors of the report -- in this case, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and, of course, the Director of National Intelligence.\nQ: Not made to preempt any characterization that the President-elect might have?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all -- well, again, you'd have to talk to them about the timing, but that timing of the report's release was not in any way directed by the White House.\nQ: On the speech tomorrow, can we say that President Obama is himself part of this drafting process?\nMR. EARNEST: You can say that President Obama is the drafting process. He's working closely with his speechwriters, but it's apparent in the drafts that these will be President Obama's words and no one else's.\nQ: Just one more question. There was apparently a party here on Friday night. Is there any chance we can get an on-the-record readout? There were reports that this thing lasted until 3:30, 4:00 in the morning.\nMR. EARNEST: What I can confirm for you is that the President and the First Lady had a wonderful time seeing so many of their friends. And from what I could tell, everybody else seemed to have a really nice time as well.\nQ: What time did you leave? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's classified.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. There are 11 days left in this administration, and this apology from the Secretary of State comes very late in the administration's tenure. Why did this apology to the LGBT community and past employees of the State Department come so late in this administration?\nMR. EARNEST: John, for the timing of this statement, I'd refer you to the Secretary of State's Office. I read the statement, but I'm not aware of all of the machinations that went on in the background to make it a reality. Obviously it does send, I think, a pretty strong message to all Americans that people should be judged not based on who they love or who they are, but based on their capacity to serve this country, and their willingness to set aside their own interests to go and represent the United States of America overseas.\nAnd there are many Americans who have embraced that patriotic duty, and certainly everybody who is qualified to do so should be able to do so and shouldn't be discriminated against just because of who they love or who they are.\nQ: There have been books, documentaries about past discrimination by the federal government against the LGBT community. Let me just cite two examples. President Dwight Eisenhower, in an executive order, declared homosexuality a sexual perversion and an issue of national security. In 1951, the FBI director at the time, J. Edgar Hoover, ordered all FBI agents to identify homosexuals working in the federal government. Does the President owe the LGBT community an apology for this past discrimination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, that's the first I'm hearing of that reference. I think President Obama has, throughout his tenure as President worked hard to stand up for the rights of LGBT Americans. And he's proud of his record. Some of that is certainly a consequence of the profound changes in our society that have taken place under a rather short period of time in a way that has made America a more perfect union.\nThe President has certainly welcomed those developments. The President has certainly encouraged those developments. And based on some of the statements that we've seen from advocates for this community, the President has played an important role in advancing those developments.\nSo he's certainly proud of his record on these issues. But with regard to an apology for the behavior, or policies or statements of previous Presidents, that's something we'll have to take a look at.\nQ: So you would not rule that out?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't rule it out, but I'm not aware that there's anything that's being cooked up to officially respond to that at this point.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Does the President have any reaction to the corruption allegations against Prime Minister Netanyahu?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any -- I don't have a specific response for you from here. Obviously, this is something that's getting a lot of attention in Israel right now, and it's certainly something that's chronicled in newspapers back here in the United States. But I make a habit of not commenting on criminal inquiries by U.S. law enforcement authorities, and I'm not going to weigh in with comments on criminal inquiries that are being conducted by Israeli law enforcement officials, either.\nQ: Completely switching gears, the President has authored quite a few articles in scientific and academic journals lately. Beyond the insatiable intellectual interests in this room, what might be motivating him to do that?\nMR. EARNEST: You and Justin certainly have that in common. Those of you who have covered the President for a long time know that the President is, almost to a fault, a rational guy and the basic underpinnings of his approach to a wide range of policy challenges are rooted in facts. And the President believes that we should carefully consider those facts. We should familiarize ourselves with those facts so that we can design the most effective solution.\nThe President also believes and hopes that the performance of his administration will be judged by facts. And when you take a look at the metrics, for example, when it comes to climate change -- which was the subject of today's episode in scientific journals published by President Barack H. Obama -- we've demonstrated as a country and as an economy the ability to fight climate change and reduce carbon pollution even as we grow the economy.\nWe have succeeded in reducing the cost of wind and solar power even as we have expanded the amount of power that we derive from those sources in a way that's had positive benefits for our economy. We know that the solar and wind energy industry have increased hiring, and we know that those are good-paying American jobs that can't be outsourced.\nSo this is, in the President's mind, an approach that is validated by the facts and by the results. And the President also believes that careful examination of those facts and those metrics points the way to the kinds of policies that should be implemented in the future to ensure that we continue making progress in solving this problem, and doing it in a way that has positive benefits for the economy.\nMany Republicans previously doubted the idea that it was possible to reduce carbon pollution and protect the planet and grow the economy. And that is a criticism that has now been gutted, because it just doesn't withhold -- it just doesn't stand up to any scrutiny.\nSo the President is pleased by his performance, and pleased by the results of the policy that he has implemented, and believes that a careful look at the facts points the way to the kinds of solutions that the American people should consider moving forward.\nQ: So does he think that his Republican critics are going to be reading science? Does he feel that current -- the current generation of scientists are not familiar with the facts? Or is this more written kind of with future generations in mind?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the reading habits of Republican members of Congress. I'll let you guys do a little digging on that one. I think the President's view is that these scientific journals are a venue where these arguments that are rooted in fact can be presented. And everybody who is willing to consider them, we certainly welcome their careful consideration.\nQ: Will there be more?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any that we have in the pipeline, but if there are additional ones we'll make sure you get them.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, when you say that the President himself is the drafting process of tomorrow's speech, is that more of a role than he's played in other major speeches that he's given would you say?\nMR. EARNEST: I would say that the President's participation in the writing of this speech is commensurate with his role in the writing of other major speeches, which is to say that the President is heavily involved. The President gets important support from his team of speechwriters, so I certainly don't want to downplay the difficult work that they do -- that the President finds it incredibly valuable. But I think -- I feel confident in telling you that even they would say that the President is the person that's writing the speech.\nQ: Does he write by longhand when he drafts these out?\nMR. EARNEST: He typically does. And this is -- some of you have seen the pictures, including a batch that Pete Souza, the presidential photographer, released at the end of last year -- that it's not uncommon for the President to take a typewritten piece of paper and, in his very compact, left-handed script, to be including detailed edits on that piece of paper.\nSo that certainly is part of the process. Part of the process also involves dictating certain passages to his speechwriters that they'll play with and mold so that it can get into a typewritten form that he can then heavily and repeatedly edit. And we're deep into that process as of very early this morning, but I would anticipate that it will continue until very early tomorrow morning.\nQ: Is tomorrow's trip still the last out-of-town by the President?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, the trip to Chicago will be President Obama's final trip outside of Washington, D.C. as President of the United States.\nQ: Does that mean they'll be his last Air Force One flights?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is likely to be his last Air Force One flight -- although it is obviously tradition for the former President to take one last flight aboard the presidential aircraft at the conclusion of the inauguration.\nQ: Will he be leaving town after the inauguration?\nMR. EARNEST: That's certainly what I would anticipate, yes.\nQ: So not going to their D.C. residence, the new one?\nMR. EARNEST: The President and First Lady will be leaving town shortly after the inaugural ceremony. But they will return, of course, to their rented house here in Washington, D.C.\nQ: Day trip?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll keep you posted.\nQ: One last question.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I'm sorry, Mark.\nQ: Is the White House -- did the White House decide to supply an aircraft to Vice President-elect Pence to bring him and his family today to Washington?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't confirm any individual flights. I know that there are a number of situations in which military aircraft have been used to help the incoming team move about the country as appropriate, but we can certainly check on whether a military aircraft was provided for the purpose that you just cited today.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Lalit.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On Chicago speech, would it include some aspects of his foreign policy, including the Asia Pacific region?\nMR. EARNEST: Lalit, I certainly wouldn't rule out a discussion of some foreign policy topics. I can't detail which ones will be included. But I would anticipate that the vast majority of his speech will be focused on many of the domestic policies and domestic considerations that the next President will have to carefully consider.\nQ: And secondly, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi had established a hotline. Will the President be passing on that hotline to President-elect Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll take a look. I'd be surprised if that was something that was discontinued. Typically those kinds of arrangements are intended to persist beyond just one presidential term, but we can confirm that for you.\nYes, sir. You've had your hand up since the beginning.\nQ: Thank you. Does the interference by a foreign government -- or can the interference by a foreign government in our electoral process be constituted as an act of war? First question. And the follow-up to the Mitch question after that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there are many members of Congress -- or at least a couple members of Congress -- who have made clear that they believe that it does. I don't have a new label to apply today. What I can tell you is that --\nQ: Cyber war?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that the administration takes this situation quite seriously. And I think that is evident from the unanimous statement that was issued back in October containing the high-confident assessment of the United States intelligence community about Russia's involvement in these nefarious activities.\nI think the seriousness is evident in the public listing of the response from the United States government to these activities that included everything from kicking some Russian diplomats out of the country for activities that they're engaged in that were inconsistent with their diplomatic status, and closing down a couple diplomatic facilities that were maintained by the Russians here in the United States. It also included some significant sanctions against some entities in the Russian government and other entities that were involved in helping the Russian government.\nSo there are other elements of our response that I'm not in a position to discuss publicly --\nQ: I understand, but would you consider it an act of war?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't have a new label to apply here today, but I think every careful examination of the evidence, of the statements from the intelligence community, and from the response that's been mobilized from the United States government, this is a situation that we take quite seriously.\nQ: And thank you for the letter from Mitch. Those who have covered him for years understand his hypocrisy. It knows no bounds. But the question is, what are you all planning to do about it, or what does the government plan to do about it going forward? I mean, making us aware of the facts seem inconsequential at this point. Are there other steps to be taken?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are certainly members of the United States Senate that, at least for the last eight years, have taken quite seriously their responsibility to offer their advice and consent to presidential nominees. Democrats and Republicans have both set a very high standard for Obama administration nominees that we've met, and the question is whether or not they have the courage and the fortitude and the back bone to adhere to --\nQ: Are you calling them out?\nMR. EARNEST: -- to adhere to the same standard for President-elect Trump's nominees. I think that's a simple question, and particularly for a President who took office vowing to drain the swamp, and particularly knowing the fear that the President-elect's supporters strike in the heart of some Republican members of the United States Senate, maybe they will respond to the President-elect's call to drain the swamp.\nQ: Have you talked to Mitch?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any new conversations to tell you about between President Obama and the Republican leader in the Senate, but certainly there are any number of conversations on a regular basis between this White House and the Congress.\nI don't know if there have been conversations about the process that is in place for President-elect Trump's nominees, but I can tell you that over the last eight years that items that are detailed in this letter have been the subject of thousands of conversations between Capitol Hill and the White House, and the thought that those conversations are no longer going to occur because Republicans in the Senate are just going to fold I think does a grave disservice to the American people.\nQ: Thank you for that sound bite.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. You're welcome.\nJared, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two. One, this McConnell question. On many areas with the transition, you've meticulously avoided, in pursuit of a smooth and effective transition, avoided criticism of the incoming administration. Why is this area different? Why does the White House feel comfortable -- is it because it's -- this is a Senate confirmation process? What is the window through which you seem to be jumping very enthusiastically?\nMR. EARNEST: I feel quite strongly about this because this is certainly not the first time in the two and half years that I've been doing this job that we've have a detailed conversation in here about the process wielded by Republicans in the Senate for confirming executive branch nominees. We've talked about this a lot. And when you consider the case of people like Adam Szubin and Merrick Garland, and the passion with which you've heard me speak about their cases in the past, you shouldn't be particularly surprised that I feel strongly about this particular situation.\nI do want to make clear -- in case it's lost on anybody -- I'm not telling anybody in the Senate how to vote. But I am suggesting that the United States Senate -- Republicans in the Senate should merely adhere to the standard that's been in place for the last eight years -- that we've met. And I'm not the only person who thinks that they should adhere to the standard. The author of the letter suggested that this standard should be in place regardless of which political party is in the majority. I agree.\nQ: Senate leaders and the President-elect's team have said that they need this to happen quickly. Why does the White House not find that argument compelling?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, let me cite a couple of reasons.\nThe first is, President Obama took office as the U.S. and global economy was hurtling off a cliff. We didn't cut any corners on ethics. So I'd be interested to hear what sort of explanation Republicans in the Senate have for why they want to cut corners when it comes to ethics in considering the incoming administration's nominees. I'm not sure that too many people are going to find their explanation particularly persuasive, which may be why we haven't heard one.\nQ: One follow-up on Sarah's question about energy independence. This is obviously a promise that the President-elect made on the campaign trail. It's a very popular promise for members of either party to make when they're running for elected office. How far down the field -- forgive the football analogy -- how far down the field does the White House believe they're leaving the ball for the next administration to either score or fumble, as they will?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the Chiefs are in the playoffs, so I'm happy to talk about all the football analogies that you want. (Laughter.) Look, there's no denying that this administration has racked up more than one first down when it comes to making progress in fighting climate change. But I think even President Obama would acknowledge that we're not even yet in field goal range in terms of solving this problem.\nI could do this all day, but I won't. (Laughter.) But I think it is an indication that we've made demonstrable progress, but there's a lot more work to be done. And so the incoming administration is going to face a question about whether or not they want to build on this momentum. That certainly is a dynamic that we often see on the football field, that you get a couple of first downs going and you can string together a constructive drive. But ultimately, the incoming administration is going to have to make a decision about whether they're willing to continue this progress or if they want to fumble it away. I couldn't resist.\nQ: Why is --\nMR. EARNEST: Let's let Jared finish, and then I'll do the last one.\nJared, anything else?\nQ: I was just going to say, do you at this point -- based on the policies that they've laid out, which play does it look like they're calling?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't predict at this point how they will take on this responsibility, but it is a significant one and it won't just be people in the United States who are watching how they handle it.\nQ: -- how Iran ended up with natural uranium as part of the JCPOA?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there are some public reports about this. What I can tell you is that, pursuant to the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, Iran had to agree to the most intrusive set of inspections and monitoring that's imposed on any country's nuclear program. And so any sort of uranium that is held by the Iranian government will be subject to very strict limits and very strict monitoring for how that material is handled. All of that will be done consistent with the agreement that does prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that does prevent Iran from shortening the amount of time that it would take for them to develop a nuclear weapon.\nQ: Without getting too much into yellow cake versus other types of uranium we're talking about here, the transfer of the uranium from Russia to Iran -- that was part of the deal, is that your understanding?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer you to the IAEA on this. What I can tell you is that these kinds of arrangements are carefully negotiated among the parties and, as I mentioned earlier, will be subject to the careful monitoring and inspections that are included in the deal to ensure that Iran is living up to the commitments that they have made.\nThanks, everybody, we'll see you on the plane tomorrow, at least some of you.\nQ: Are you going to brief tomorrow or just gaggle on the plane?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll just gaggle on the plane tomorrow.\nThanks, everybody. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nEND 2:00 P.M.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120997", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Chicago, Illinois\nMR. EARNEST: Before we get started, all of you may have seen that the President spent some time in the hangar that houses Air Force One, before we took off. But while he was there, the President was able to speak to all the members of the Presidential Airlift group. These are the men and women of the United States Air Force that have a full-time job, which is maintaining Air Force One and ensuring that it continues to serve as the safe, dependable, comfortable aircraft that all of us enjoy every time we travel with the President of the United States.\nSo the President, I believe, has spoken to just about all of them before in one setting or another, but I believe this was the first time he had an opportunity to speak to them as a group. After his short remarks, the President had an opportunity to shake hands with every man and woman who serves in the Presidential Airlift group and thank them for their service to the country and to thank them for the remarkable service that they have provided to him and his family, but also all of us. So that was a nice moment.\nI have a couple of metrics that may be useful.\nQ: Were their families there?\nMR. EARNEST: Their families weren't there -- just the servicemembers. A couple of other metrics I think that illustrate powerfully exactly the service they provide: We are actually onboard the flight as Air Force One flies its 445th mission with President Obama onboard. It's the 445th mission with President Obama onboard. Total, before this flight, Air Force One was airborne with President Obama aboard for 2,799 hours and six minutes, and that equates consecutively to 116 days spent on Air Force One.\nAir Force One has touched down -- let me actually -- this is worded interestingly, and I'm going to try to do this in a way that you guys will think is fun. There are 49 states that President Obama has traveled to on Air Force One. Can you name the 50th one that he has not? Playing a little version of Jeopardy.\nQ: Maryland.\nMR. EARNEST: Maryland -- exactly. We always depart from Maryland but never travel to Maryland on Air Force One. So I thought that was pretty clever. (Laughter.)\nFifty-six different countries have been the destination for presidential travel aboard Air Force One. So that gives you a sense of how much time President Obama has spent aboard this airplane. It also gives you a sense of how much work has gone into supporting the President as he represents our country and travels around the world. Obviously, the President is deeply indebted to them for their service, and he had an opportunity to thank them in person.\nQ: Does this mean he's going to miss the aircraft?\nMR. EARNEST: I think all of you have heard him say a number of times in public just how much he is going to miss having the opportunity to travel aboard Air Force One. There is no aircraft in the world that can do what Air Force One can do, and certainly under the demanding circumstances under which this aircraft conducts these missions. And the message that the President delivered to the men and women of the Presidential Airlift group is that the reason that this airplane is so special is not just because of the technology onboard, but because of the dedication and the investment that the men and women of the United States Air Force have made to this aircraft. So it's genuinely a national treasure, and President Obama feels deeply fortunate to have benefitted from their tireless commitment to their job.\nQ: We were going to get you gifts for your last gaggle, like some drink coupons. But we thought having them on time wouldn't be in keeping with Josh Earnest style. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'll take it. One other thing before we get to your serious question -- and this is to the photographers in the back -- five years ago -- more than five years ago, I did my first gaggle back in June of 2011. I walked back here for the first time, through this doorway, and all the photographers are doing what they're doing now. And they are assured me that they'd photographed every gaggle. (Laughter.) So I totally got rolled, so it obviously seems fitting to have you photograph the last gaggle that I do aboard Air Force One.\nSo with all of that, I don't know if you guys have any news of the day we need to get to. If not, that would be fine too. (Laughter.) You probably have a little bit.\nQ: There's a bill in Congress about Russia called the Countering Russia Hostilities Act of 2017. I was wondering if the President -- is that something the President would support?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the details of the legislation. I could tell you that the President certainly does believe that there is an important role for Congress to play when it comes to countering Russia's malicious cyber activity, most recently their efforts to undermine public confidence in our democracy. That is one of the reasons that the President asked the intelligence community to compile the report that was issued at the end of last week. The President asked that senior members of Congress actually be briefed not just on the unclassified version of the report, but to actually be briefed on the classified version of the report.\nMy understanding is that every member of Congress received one classified version of the report, and there's one version of the report that has the highest classification that was presented to the congressional leadership. And that, I think, is an illustration of just how seriously the administration takes these matters and how important it is for Congress to fulfill their basic responsibility in protecting the country. And that can certainly involve hearings. I know that there are some members of Congress that are interested in hearings. I know there are other members of Congress that are interested in additional sanctions being applied to Russia in response to their malicious cyber actions. All of this is worthy of congressional attention, but I don't have a specific decision on the legislation to share with you.\nQ: Generally, do you support the idea of Congress passing legislation to codify some of what the President did executively in terms of sanctions? In other instances, particularly on Iran, you have opposed or have said it's unnecessary for Congress to take that sort of action.\nMR. EARNEST: What we have often observed is that the executive branch, whether it's the President of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury, does already have extensive authorities that they can use to apply sanctions against individuals or entities or countries around the world. In this case -- so that's a fact, and that is why there are some occasions where we have expressed some opposition to congressionally mandated sanctions, because oftentimes they are duplicative of executive authorities the President has and had already used in many cases.\nSo in other situations, there is a role for Congress to play in terms of imposing sanctions. There's sanctions legislation with regard to North Korea, for example, that I know that the administration has supported in the past. So we have not, as a matter of principle, opposed all legislative activity with regard to sanctions. There are some situations where we have opposed sanctions -- or not necessarily opposed sanctions, but have said that sanctions were not necessary because the executive branch already had the necessary authority to impose sanctions at the President's discretion.\nQ: And then one more. But this is an instance where if -- the President does have the authority to do what Congress is looking to codify -- I guess what I'm asking is, are you guys open to them doing that, even if it's unnecessary, as you might describe that characterization to it because it's Russia and because President-elect Trump is going to come in and could potentially undo what the President did executively?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that obviously after January 20th, President-elect Trump will have to determine exactly how he wants to exercise his executive authority. I think the most recent example where we have encountered this situation was actually with regard to the Iran Sanctions Act at the end of last year. Congress passed legislation to impose additional sanctions against Iran. The administration did not support that legislation because of our view that there was already sufficient executive authorities the President could use to impose financial penalties against Iran. But you'll also recall that the President didn't veto that legislation because it didn't undermine the effective implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nSo I think that's an illustration that we have judged each proposed legislative package of sanctions individually and on its merits. And we would do that in this case as well, but I haven't had a chance to take a look at exactly what Congress is proposing.\nQ: Can you give us a sense of the President's mood heading into Chicago and the speech tonight? I mean, the speech tonight and sort of the next-to-the-last big \"it's over\" moment for him. So can you talk a little bit about his mood?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that particularly in the last 72 hours or so, the President has been working diligently on his remarks for tonight. The President is not one to be overly sentimental, but given the circumstances I think it would be unrealistic to expect anybody to not feel some nostalgia for this moment.\nThe President has had the blessing of serving this country as President for the last eight years. He's deeply grateful to the American people, including those that did not vote for him and did not support all of the policies that he put forward -- because he's recognized that even many of those Americans, even those who didn't always agree with him have prayed for him, have supported his family, and out of patriotism to the country have shown respect to the office of the presidency. And the President is deeply grateful for that, and he'll express that gratitude in his remarks tonight.\nIn his remarks, the President will also express his unrelenting optimism about the future of the country and the future of our democracy. Obviously, the President on a number of occasions has indicated that the election didn't turn out the way that he had hoped, but the President retains profound confidence in our country and in our citizens and in our system of democracy. And it's not blind faith, so you'll hear the President once again encourage the American people to take an active role in their democracy not just in the run-up to elections, but every day, in engaging in their communities, in being educated on the issues and making their voice heard, and engaging in a broader public debate about what's best for the country.\nThe President believes that the success and the vibrancy of our democracy depends on that kind of citizen engagement. The President, as you've all heard him say many times, believes that our democracy works best when it works from the ground up. That's how change happens. And the President certainly benefitted from change that originated at the grassroots, and he hopes that the American people will continue to remain engaged in that way. If they do, the future for our country is as bright as it's ever been.\nQ: Speech done?\nMR. EARNEST: I would say the speech is all but done. I think the President is going to reserve the right to make a few last-minute line edits on the flight. I know that that was a presidential directive that was issued to the speechwriters shortly before I walked back here. But I would say that the version that currently rests on Cody Keenan's laptop is essentially the version that he'll be reading from tonight.\nQ: Do you have a sense of what he plans to do, either publicly or behind the scenes, to advocate for the issues that he cares about going forward after leaving office tonight?\nMR. EARNEST: That will not be part of the speech. There will be a time and a place for the President to speak at more length about what he intends to do once he leaves office. But today -- tonight, the speech will be focused on the future of the country, the future of our democracy, and just how important it is for all Americans to be engaged in the work of building our country and moving it in the direction of a more perfect union.\nThe President will express particular confidence and optimism in the younger generation of Americans that's coming of age now. And in the President's mind it's important to also take a moment to speak to them, and he'll do that in his remarks, as well.\nQ: Was he monitoring Senator Sessions confirmation hearing today at all, or were folks at the White House? And did you have any reaction to the proceeding?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has been following it. I've had -- while I was in the office I had the television on in the background a little bit. It was apparent that there was -- according to my email, it looks like it's still ongoing, so a lengthy hearing.\nWe've often said that Congress does have an important responsibility to provide advice and consent to the President's nomination. I will say that Senator Grassley and the Republicans in the Senate didn't consider Attorney General Lynch's nomination with the same haste and courtesy that she was entitled to, and certainly not with the same speed and courtesy that's been shown to Senator Sessions. I'm sure they've got an explanation for that, but obviously it will be up to the individual senators to decide exactly whether or not they want to support President Trump's -- President-elect Trump's nomination.\nQ: We've seen movement among congressional Republicans from the repeal-then-replace of Obamacare, doing them in conjunction. Is that something that you guys are heartened by, to see the process develop in that way? Or is your sort of opinion on the whole thing that you hope they won't touch the law at all, or kind of only at --\nMR. EARNEST: The argument that we've been making since the President signed the bill into law is that the President hopes that Democrats and Republicans would come together around specific ideas for strengthening the Affordable Care Act. There are some common-sense things that can be done that would make health care more affordable for many Americans. There are some things that Republican governors could do that would expand access to Medicaid for many Americans. That would result in millions of Americans getting access to health care coverage that they don't currently have.\nThe President has expressed a deep concern about the idea that Republicans would repeal the Affordable Care Act without putting forward a replacement that would risk 30 million Americans losing their health insurance, seeing the entire health insurance market thrown into chaos, including those Americans that get their health insurance through their employer.\nSo this would be a bad step for our economy, obviously a bad step for the health of hundreds of millions of Americans across the country. So I think it's too early to judge exactly whether or not this is a constructive step, but I think this does highlight a couple of things. The first is, I do think it highlights concerns that Republicans have -- newly expressed concerns about the potential that their action to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be bad for the country, bad for the economy, and bad for Republicans politically. All that's true from our perspective.\nThey're also laying bare the fact that despite the fact that Republicans, for almost seven years now, have been claiming that they have their own alternative to health care reform, that they actually don't -- because if they did, it would be on the table right now.\nAnd this goes to something -- an argument that I made frequently during the campaign, which is that the Republican governing philosophy was centered on saying no and not actually presenting any affirmative ideas for moving the country in the right direction. And again, that may have been good politically in the short term for Republicans, but it's bad in the short term and long term for the country. And I don't think it's a sustainable approach when the American people are looking to the Republican Party to actually make some governing decisions for a change.\nQ: Josh, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. agreed today to lead a panel studying vaccines -- the safety of vaccines for President-elect Trump. Is that something that this White House thinks needs to be done?\nMR. EARNEST: Every scientific expert that I've heard from has expressed in pretty unambiguous terms that there's not any scientific ambiguity about this. And so I haven't seen in detail exactly what the incoming administration and some of his appointments are planning to do, but the scientific advice that has been consistently offered by government and non-government scientists alike is that parents should have their children vaccinated. That's good for their children and it's also good for our broader society.\nAnd the refusal on the part of some families to have their children vaccinated puts other kids with health problems at serious risk. There are some people that have legitimate medical reasons why they can't be vaccinated against measles, for example. And the idea that children who can have the vaccine choose not to, based on the misguided advice that was given to their parents, puts those children who can't be vaccinated at pretty serious risk.\nI remember we had a debate about this a year or so ago. Children can't get the measles vaccine until they're a year old. So if there's some six-year-old running around out there that didn't get the vaccine, even if they could have, catches measles, that puts every infant in the community at risk. And there's no good scientific justification for doing something like that.\nSo, again, that's the advice that has been consistently put forward by the CDC and other officials at HHS. But this is also the kind of advice that scientists and academia and the private sector have offered as well. But I don't want to speak in a whole lot of detail with regard to the incoming administration's plans because I haven't heard much about it.\nQ: -- earlier about about Air Force One (inaudible). You said 445th mission. What is the definition of a mission -- because most of these trips have multiple stops?\nMR. EARNEST: A round trip. I'm going to confirm this with the military aide before I go farther, but I think what is true is -- for example, the roundtrip flight that we're on is one mission. So, now, when there are multiple legs like, for example, a foreign trip, I don't know how that breaks down. But we'll see if we can get you some more detail on that.\nQ: The chairman of Donald Trump's inauguration committee said today that President Obama had invited the President-elect to ride with him to the Capitol on Inauguration Day. You had a question about that at the briefing last week that you didn't want to go into any detail. Can you confirm at least that part, that (inaudible) Friday -- or a week from Friday?\nMR. EARNEST: We're still putting together the details of January 20th. I just want to make sure that everything is set before we roll out the schedule for the President's activities on January 20th. What I can tell you as guidance is that we intend to have a schedule that honors the kinds of tradition that previous outgoing Presidents have honored. But we'll follow up with you on all the details of that day as soon as we can.\nQ: Is the President doing something different? I don't get what the whole --\nMR. EARNEST: I think that the schedule that President Obama will have on January 20th will be quite similar to the schedule that previous Presidents have had. But until we get all the elements of the schedule locked down, I don't want to go into confirming individual aspects of his schedule. But we'll lay all that out well in advance of the 20th.\nAll right, thank you all.\nQ: Congratulations on your last gaggle, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you. It's been almost always fun. We've had some interesting gaggles, haven't we? There were times where we -- I know I was -- my colleagues were urging me to include a bad turbulence time, but I couldn't really work it in. But there have been times where we've -- we'll work on something here. But whether it's landing while we're gaggling, or people falling while we're gaggling --\nQ: -- how many?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that. They count the briefings, but I don't know if they count the gaggles.\nThere was also one time in which the gaggle was broadcast live on one television network back home. This was on the day that, tragically, the Malaysia airplane was shot down over separatist-controlled area in Ukraine. And you'll recall that when the news of that tragedy broke, that President Obama was on the phone with President Putin at the time. And the first reaction from the White House was -- shortly after President Obama concluded that phone call, he boarded Marine One, we boarded Air Force One and then we flew to Delaware -- and this was the first reaction from the United States government was in the gaggle on the flight to Delaware. And I got all kinds of texts and emails from people that they were hearing me live on ABC. So, quite a day.\nQ: And dealing us even when you may not want to. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: What I have found is that gaggles are actually fun. In some ways, having a smaller group of people and standing so close to all of you makes it a little less formal and, in many ways, a little bit more efficient than the daily briefing.\nBut I certainly appreciate the all the dedication that all of you show. A lot of us, we get on the airplane and have an opportunity just to -- I'll spend a little time preparing for the gaggle, come back and talk to all of you, and then I go back and put my feet up. And as soon as I walk away from here you guys all have to get to work. So that's never been lost on me. But I certainly appreciate the dedication that you've shown in doing this job, and it's not something that I'm going to soon forget. So, thank you guys.", "timestamp": "2017-01-10", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Sessions' 'Character And Qualifications' In Opening Statement\nClick To Watch\nGRASSLEY: \"Our hearing today hardly introduces Senator Sessions to the Committee. No, we're here today to review the character and qualifications of a colleague who has served alongside us in the Senate for twenty years. That includes time as the Ranking Member of this Committee. We know him well. We know the policy positions he has taken as a legislator. I've been on both sides of debates with Senator Sessions. Having served with him for so long we pretty well know whether he supports your policy positions or opposes them. He tells us so with thoughtfulness, humility, and respect. As a former Chairman of this Committee has put it, Senator Sessions is 'wonderful to work with.' We know him to be, as another senior Democrat on this Committee described him, 'a man of his word.' As a third senior Democrat colleague put it, \"he is always a gentleman'; 'he is straightforward and fair.'\n\"Most of all, the Members of this Committee know him to be a leader who has served the people of Alabama-and all Americans- with integrity, dedication, and courage.\n\"As former Chairman Leahy observed the last time a new President took office, it's 'important that the Justice Department have its senior leadership in place without delay. . . . We need the Justice Department to be at its best.' Perhaps my good friend Senator Schumer said it best when he observed that we should 'move to a vote, hopefully sooner rather than later.' And when we do, as he said, we 'won't be voting for or against the President's policies.' Instead, we'll be voting for a colleague with a first-rate legal mind whose record proves his commitment to just law enforcement and eminently qualifies him to lead the Department of Justice.\n\"I've been encouraged by the initial support many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed for Senator Sessions' nomination. So I look forward to hearing from Senator Sessions and moving to his confirmation without delay.\n\"Senator Sessions' record is a life of public service. And so we know his story. He was raised in the small town of Hybart, Alabama, where his father owned and ran a small country store. He then studied at Huntingdon College and the University of Alabama before practicing law in Russellville and Mobile. Senator Sessions has always been an active member of his community. He taught school before attending law school and taught Sunday School at Ashland Place Methodist Church. He served our Nation in the Army Reserve, attaining the rank of Captain.\n\"After his time in private practice, Senator Sessions served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Alabama. He then headed that office after the Senate confirmed him as United States Attorney, a post he held for a dozen years. All told, that's 15 years as a federal prosecutor in the Department.\n\"It was during that time that he oversaw the investigation of Klansman Francis Hays for the brutal abduction and murder of a black teenager, Michael Donald. He made sure that case was brought in state court where the defendant was eligible for and received the punishment he justly deserved, the death penalty. His office then successfully prosecuted that murderer's accomplice in federal court.\n\"Based on his prosecutorial record, the people of Alabama elected him their Attorney General and then their Senator. He has served with us since 1997. And, as our former Chairman observed, this Committee has relied on him for his prosecutorial experience during the course of his Senate service.\n\"Throughout his public service, both within the Department and outside of it, he has raised his hand and served when called upon. He has done his duty, enforced the law fairly, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\"Reflecting on this record of service, it's no surprise that Senator Sessions is also an Eagle Scout. Other members of this Committee may know, as I do, that the Scouts' motto-\"Be Prepared\"-sits on his desk in his Senate office.\n\"Senator Sessions' entire life of dedicated public service has prepared him for this day. If he's confirmed-and I expect he will be-Senator Sessions will shed his role as a legislator who writes our laws and he'll take on the task of enforcing the laws Congress has written. He has made this transition before, when the people of the State of Alabama elected him their Senator based on his record of service as United States Attorney and Attorney General there.\n\"As one Member of this Committee observed about a lawyer's transition into the role of a judge: 'There are turning points in a person's life when they put away things of the past and move into new responsibilities.' Serving as our Nation's Attorney General will mark another such turning point in Senator Sessions' distinguished career.\n\"And every Member of this Committee knows from experience that, in his new role, Senator Sessions will be a leader for law and order administered without regard to person.\n\"Leadership to that end is exactly what the Department now needs. It should go without saying that the Department is tasked with the responsibility of enforcing our laws-ALL of our laws- in a dispassionate and even-handed way.\n\"We write the laws. The Executive enforces them, faithfully. This is a simple but foundational principle.\n\"Unfortunately, for the last several years the Department has simply declined to enforce some laws the Executive branch found distasteful. The Department's failure to enforce the law has run the gamut of issues from criminal law legislation to our nation's duly enacted immigration laws.\n\"It's true that each branch of government has an independent duty to assess the constitutionality of the laws it writes, administers, or adjudicates. But it's equally true that the Executive has a constitutional responsibility to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" I know our colleague Senator Sessions respects the legislative process and the prerogative of Congress to write the law. As he explained during the confirmation hearing we held for John Ashcroft's nomination to serve as Attorney General, \"The Attorney General is a law enforcer. There is a big difference between a politician and a Senator where we vote on policy and executing policy.\n\"I look forward to hearing from Senator Sessions on how he will transition from voting on policy matters to enforcing the laws he has labored so long to improve and sustain.\n\"Just as he respects Congress's duly enacted laws, Senator Sessions knows and respects the importance of an independent Attorney General at the Department's helm. When he has questioned other candidates for the office of Attorney General, he has made plain the priority of an Attorney General's independence.\nSen. Richard Shelby Lauds Sessions' \"Extraordinary Character,' 'Intellect,' 'Integrity'\nClick To Watch\nSHELBY: \"Although my friend and colleague, Jeff Sessions, is well known to the members of this committee, it's my distinct privilege to introduce him as president-elect Donald Trump's nominee to serve as our next United States attorney general.\n\"Before joining the Senate, Jeff sessions began his distinguished career as a practicing attorney, and then served as the United States attorney for Alabama's Southern district, before ultimately becoming the attorney general of the state of Alabama.\n\"During the past 20 years here in the U.S. Senate that I have served with Jeff Sessions, I've had the opportunity to know him well, not just as a skilled attorney with an accomplished record as a prosecutor and as a legislator, but a man of extraordinary character. I have the highest regard, not only for his intellect, but for his integrity.\n\"Unfortunately, since the announcement of his nomination, Jeff's political opponents have attacked his character with baseless and tired allegations, but in reality, Jeff Sessions' extensive record of treating all-Americans equally under the law is clear and well documented.\n\"Throughout his decades of public service, including his impressive tenure on this committee, Jeff's commitment to upholding the rule of law I believe is unparalleled. The integrity, humility and gravity with which Jeff Sessions will approach the Office of Attorney General of the United States is unquestionable. I have no doubt, Mr. Chairman, that he will apply the law with the impartiality required of the job. I'm also confident this committee will report favorably and expeditiously, Jeff Sessions' nomination to be the next attorney general of the United States.\"\nSen. Susan Collins Gives Powerful Intro To Sen. Sessions' Character, Calls Out Vicious Personal Attacks\nClick To Watch\nCOLLINS: \"I am pleased to join Senator Shelby in presenting my friend and colleague senator Jeff Sessions and to offer my support for his nomination to be our next attorney general.\n\"Jeff Sessions and I were first sworn in to the United States Senate on the very same day. In the 20 years since, we have worked closely on some issues and on opposite sides on others. In fact, it would be fair to say that we have had our share of vigorous debates and policy disagreements.\n\"Through these experiences, I have come to know Senator Sessions professionally as a trusted colleague and personally as a good friend. I can vouch confidently for the fact those Jeff sessions is a person of integrity, a principled leader, and a dedicated public servant.\n\"As a senator, Jeff Sessions has worked across the aisle to lead important legislative reforms. He's worked with Senator Dick Durbin to pass the Fair Sentencing Act, a law that addressed the unfair racial disparity in crack cocaine sentencing. He worked with Senator Ted Kennedy to pass the Prison Rape Elimination Act. And with Senator Chris Coons on the reauthorization of the Victims of Child Abuse Act, an area where Senator Sessions and I have worked together is in opposing unfair trade agreements and practices that hurt American workers.\n\"What I want this committee and the American people to know, is that Jeff Sessions is the same genuine, fair-minded person in the unguarded private moments as he is in the halls of the Senate. We first came to know each other during dinners with other members of our Senate class, where we discussed everything from our politics to our families.\n\"I have never witnessed anything to suggest that Senator Sessions is anyone other than a dedicated public servant and a decent man. In 1980, long before he ran for the Senate or even dreamed of being attorney general, Jeff Sessions sponsored the first African-American member of the Mobile Lions Club. As U.S. attorney, he provided leadership and the successful convictions of two Klan members who had murdered an African-American teenager.\n\"As Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2009, he appointed the first African-American to serve as chief counsel to the Republican members. My friends, these are not the actions of an individual who is motivated by racial animus. In spite of his strong record, Senator Sessions nomination has generated controversy. He has had to withstand some very painful attacks on his characters, both years ago and again today, with little or no acknowledgment of his accomplishments and actions, or the responses he has made to the accusations levied against him.\n\"As this committee debates this nomination, I would draw your attention to an important epilogue to Jeff Sessions nomination 31 years ago to be a federal judge. The late Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania was a member of the judiciary committee when the Sessions nomination was considered in 1986. Senator Specter, then a Republican, voted against Jeff Sessions.\n\"Years later, in 2009, Senator Specter had switched parties. He was asked by a reporter if he regretted any of the more than 10,000 votes he had cast. Out of all of those votes, then Democratic Senator Specter sited just one. It was his vote against confirming Jeff Sessions as a federal judge.\n\"When asked why, Senator Specter replied, quote, 'because I have since found that Senator Sessions is Egalitarian.', end quote. In other words, once Senator Specter served with Jeff Sessions and had the opportunity to get to know him, he changed his mind.\n\"I hope that you will keep Arlen Specter's reflections in mind, as this committee evaluates Senator Sessions' public service, his character and his fidelity to the rule of law.\"\nSen. Sessions Forcefully Defends His Record \"Straight On\"\nClick To Watch\nSESSIONS: \"Let me address another issue straight on. I was accused in 1986 of failing to protect the voting rights of African-Americans by presenting the Perry County case, the voter fraud case, and of condemning civil rights advocates and organizations and even harboring, amazingly, sympathies for the KKK.\n\"These (inaudible) false charges. The voter fraud case my office prosecuted was in response to pleas from African-American incumbent elected officials who claimed that the absentee ballot process involved a situation in which ballots cast for them were stolen, altered and cast for their opponents. The prosecution sought to protect the integrity of the ballot, not to block voting. It was a voting rights case.\n\"As to the KKK, I invited civil rights attorneys from Washington, D.C. to help us solve a very difficult investigation into the unconscionable, horrendous death of a young African-American coming home from the 7-Eleven store at night simply because he was black. His -- Michael O'Donnell -- and actively backed the attorneys throughout the case and they broke that case.\n\"That effort led to a guilty plea and a life sentence in court for one defendant and his testimony against this other defendant. There was no federal death penalty at the time. I felt the death penalty was appropriate in this case and I pushed to have it tried in state court, which was done. That defendant was indeed convicted and sentenced to death.\n\"And 10 years later, ironically, as Alabama's attorney general, my staff participated in the defense of that verdict and sentence, and a few months after, I became a United States senator and that murdering klansman was indeed executed.\n\"I abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology. I insisted Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center and his lawsuit that led to the successful collapse of the Klan at least in Alabama, the seizure of their building, at least for that period of time.\n\"As civil rights division attorneys have testified before the committee, I supported fully their historic cases that the Justice Department filed to advance civil rights and that I supported, including cases to desegregate schools, abolish at-large elections for cities, county commissions and school boards.\n\"These at-large elections were a mechanism used to block African- American candidates from being able to be elected to boards and commissions. It was deliberate and part of a systemic plan to reduce the ability of African-Americans to have influence in the election and governing process.\n\"I never declared the NAACP was un-American or that a civil rights attorney was a disgrace to his race. There is nothing I am more proud of than my 14 years of service in the Department of Justice. I love and venerate that great institution. I hold dear its highest ideals. As God gives me the ability, I will work every day to be worthy of the demands of this august office.\n\"You can be absolutely sure that I understand the immense responsibility I would have. I am not naive. I know the threat that our rising crime and addiction rates pose to the health and safety of our country. I know the threat of terrorism. I deeply understand the history of civil rights in our country and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters. I have witnessed it.\n\"We must continue to move forward and never back. I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by our LGBT community. I will ensure that the statutes protecting their civil rights and their safety are fully enforced.\n\"I understand the lifelong scars worn by women who are victims of assault and abuse. And if I am so fortunate to be confirmed as your attorney general, you can know that I understand the absolute necessity, that all my actions must fall within the bounds of the Constitution and the laws of the United States. While all humans must recognize the limits of their abilities, and I certainly do, I am ready for this job. We will do it right. Your input will be valued. Local law enforcement will be our partners. Many friends in federal government that I've had in law enforcement will be respected.\n\"I've always loved the law. It is the very foundation of this country. It is the exceptional foundation of America. I have an abiding commitment to pursuing and achieving justice and a record of doing that. And if confirmed, I will give all my efforts to this goal. I only ask that you do your duty as God gives you the ability to see that duty as your charge by the Constitution.\"\nSen. Sessions: As Police Work With Their Communities, \"We As A Nation Need To Respect Our Law Officers\"\nClick To Watch\nSESSIONS: \"That is the kind of thing that too often happens. We need to be sure that when we criticize law officers, it is narrowly focused on the right basis for criticism and to smear whole departments, places those officers at greater risk.\n\"And we are seeing an increase in murder of police officers, it was up 10 percent last year. So I could just say, I could feel -- I could feel in my bones, how it was going to play out in the real world when we had, what I thought often times, was legitimate criticism of a perhaps, wrong doing by an officer. But spilling over to a condemnation of our entire police force and morale has been affected.\n\"And its impacted the crime rates in Baltimore and crime rates in Chicago. I don't think there's any doubt about it. I regret that's happening, I think it can be restored. But we need to understand the requirement that the police work with the community and be respectful of their community, but we as a nation, need to respect our law officers too.\"\nSessions Pledged Loyalty To The Constitution, Rule Of Law And Equal Justice\nClick To Watch\nSESSIONS: \"I want to thank President-elect Donald Trump for the confidence and trust he has shown in me by nominating me to serve as the Attorney General of the United States. I feel the weight of an honor greater than I aspired to. If I am confirmed, I will commit to you and to the American people to be worthy of the office and the special trust that comes with it.\n\"So, I come before you today as a colleague, who's worked with you for years -- and some of you 20 years. You know who I am, you know what I believe in, you know that I'm a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do. You know that I revere the Constitution, that I'm committed to the rule of law. And you know that I believe in fairness, impartiality and equal justice under law.\n\"Over the years, you've heard me say many times that I love the Department of Justice. The Office of Attorney General of the United States is not a normal political office and anyone who holds it must have totally fidelity to the laws and the Constitution of the United States.\n\"He or she must be committed to following the law. He or she must be willing to tell the president or other top officials if -- no if he or they overreach. He or she cannot be a mere rubber stamp. He or she must set the example for the employees of the department to do the right thing and ensure that when they do the right thing they know the attorney general will back them up.\n\"No matter what politician might call or what powerful special interest, influential contributor or friend might try to intervene. The message must be clear, everyone is expected to do their duty. That is the way I was expected to perform as an assistant United States attorney working for Attorney General Meese in part of my career.\n\"And that is the way I trained my assistants when I became United States attorney. And if confirmed, that is the way I will lead the Department of Justice. In my over 14 years in the Department of Justice, I tried cases personally of every kind; drug trafficking, very large international smuggling cases, many firearms cases, other violent crimes, a series of public corruption cases of quite significance, financial wrongdoing and environmental violations.\n\"Our office supported historic civil rights cases and major civil cases; protecting the people of this country from crime and especially from violent crime is a high calling of the men and women of the Department of Justice.\"", "timestamp": "2017-01-10", "title": "Press Release - Top Moments from Today's Hearing on Sen.

Hello, Chicago! It's good to be home! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's good to be home. Thanks. All right, everybody sit down. We're on live TV here. I've got to—I've got to move. You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions. [Laughter] Everybody have a seat.\nMy fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well wishes that we've received over the past few weeks. But tonight, tonight it's my turn to say thanks. Whether we have seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people, in living rooms and in schools, at farms, on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts—those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going. And every day, I have learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.\nSo I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties. And I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose in my life. And it was a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. I can't do that.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand it.\nAfter 8 years as your President, I still believe that. And it's not just my belief. It's the beating heart of our American idea, our bold experiment in self-government. It's the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect Union.\nWhat a radical idea, a great gift that our Founders gave to us: The freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat and toil and imagination, and the imperative to strive together, as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good.\nFor 240 years, our Nation's call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation. It's what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom. It's what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande. It's what pushed women to reach for the ballot. It's what powered workers to organize. It's why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima, Iraq and Afghanistan, and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.\nSo that's what we mean when we say America's exceptional: not that our Nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change and make life better for those who follow. Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard. It's always been contentious. Sometimes it's been bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just some.\nIf I had told you 8 years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history; if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11; if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens—if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high. But that's what we did. That's what you did.\nYou were the change. You answered people's hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.\nIn 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No, no, no, no, no, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected President to the next. I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me. Because it's up to all of us to make sure our Government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.\nWe have what we need to do so. We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth. Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours. But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people. Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.\nThat's what I want to focus on tonight: the state of our democracy. Understand, democracy does not require uniformity. Our Founders argued. They quarreled. Eventually, they compromised. They expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity: the idea that for all our outward differences, we're all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.\nThere have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity. The beginning of this century has been one of those times. A shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change, and the specter of terrorism—these forces haven't just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well. And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland. In other words, it will determine our future.\nTo begin with, our democracy won't work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity. And the good news is that today the economy is growing again. Wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are all rising again. Poverty is falling again. The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records. The unemployment rate is near a 10-year low. The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower. Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years. And I've said and I mean it: If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we've made to our health care system that covers as many people at less cost, I will publicly support it.\nBecause that, after all, is why we serve. Not to score points or take credit, but to make people's lives better.\nBut for all the real progress that we've made, we know it's not enough. Our economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle class. That's the economic argument. But stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic ideal. While the top 1 percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many of our families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind—the laid off factory worker, the waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills—convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their Government only serves the interests of the powerful. That's a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.\nBut there are no quick fixes to this long-term trend. I agree, our trade should be fair and not just free. But the next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle class jobs obsolete.\nAnd so we're going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need, to give workers the power to unionize for better wages, to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now, and make more reforms to the Tax Code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from this new economy don't avoid their obligations to the country that's made their very success possible.\nWe can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we can't be complacent about the goals themselves. For if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.\nThere's a second threat to our democracy, and this one is as old as our Nation itself. After my election, there was talk of a postracial America. And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. Now, I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. You can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.\nBut we're not where we need to be. And all of us have more work to do. If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we're unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don't look like us, we will diminish the prospects of our own children, because those Brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of America's workforce. And we have shown that our economy doesn't have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women.\nSo if we're going to be serious about race going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination: in hiring and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice system. That is what our Constitution and our highest ideals require. But laws alone won't be enough. Hearts must change. It won't change overnight. Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change. But if our democracy is to work, the way it should, in this increasingly diverse Nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said, \"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\"\nFor Blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face, not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged White guy who, from the outside, may seem like he's got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change. We have to pay attention and listen.\nFor White Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the sixties, that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness. When they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment that our Founders promised.\nFor native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish and Italians and Poles, who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of America. And as it turned out, America wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this Nation's creed, and this Nation was strengthened.\nSo regardless of the station that we occupy, we all have to try harder. We all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family just like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.\nAnd that's not easy to do. For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. And the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste—all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\nAnd this trend represents a third threat to our democracy. But politics is a battle of ideas. That's how our democracy was designed. In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we're going to keep talking past each other, and we'll make common ground and compromise impossible.\nAnd isn't that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing? It's not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; it's self-defeating. Because, as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you. Take the challenge of climate change. In just 8 years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil, we've doubled our renewable energy, we've led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet. But without bolder action, our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change. They'll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.\nNow, we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country, the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.\nIt is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse: the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral, the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket.\nIt's that spirit, a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might, that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression; that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations, but built on principles: the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion and speech and assembly, and an independent press.\nThat order is now being challenged, first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam, more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets and open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their power. The peril each poses to our democracy is more far-reaching than a car bomb or a missile. They represent the fear of change; the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently; a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable; an intolerance of dissent and free thought; a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what's true and what's right.\nBecause of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troops, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past 8 years. And although Boston and Orlando and San Bernardino and Fort Hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. We have taken out tens of thousands of terrorists, including bin Laden. The global coalition we're leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders and taken away about half their territory. ISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.\nAnd to all who serve or have served, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander in Chief. And we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude.\nBut protecting our way of life, that's not just the job of our military. Democracy can buckle when it gives in to fear. So, just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.\nAnd that's why, for the past 8 years, I've worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing. That's why we've ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, reformed our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans, who are just as patriotic as we are. [Applause]\nThat's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights: to expand democracy and human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. No matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem, that's part of defending America. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression. If the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.\nSo let's be vigilant, but not afraid. ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world, unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.\nWhich brings me to my final point: Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions. When voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote. When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service. When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our congressional districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.\nBut remember, none of this happens on its own. All of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swinging.\nOur Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift, but it's really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power. We, the people, give it meaning with our participation and with the choices that we make and the alliances that we forge. Whether or not we stand up for our freedoms, whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law, that's up to us. America is no fragile thing, but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.\nIn his own Farewell Address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but \"from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken . . . to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth.\" And so we have to preserve this truth with \"jealous anxiety;\" that we should reject \"the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties\" that make us one.\nAmerica, we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren't even willing to enter into public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are seen not just as misguided, but as malevolent. We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others, when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.\nIt falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great Nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we, in fact, all share the same proud title, the most important office in a democracy: citizen. Citizen.\nSo, you see, that's what our democracy demands. It needs you. Not just when there's an election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life. If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Stay at it.\nSometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose. Presuming a reservoir of goodness in other people, that can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you. But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work and to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America, and in Americans, will be confirmed.\nMine sure has been. Over the course of these 8 years, I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I have mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and found grace in a Charleston church. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch. I've seen wounded warriors who at points were given up for dead walk again. I've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. I've seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and, above all, to look out for each other.\nSo that faith that I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change—that faith has been rewarded in ways I could not have possibly imagined. And I hope your faith has, too. Some of you here tonight or watching at home, you were there with us in 2004, in 2008, 2012; maybe you still can't believe we pulled this whole thing off. Let me tell you, you're not the only ones. [Laughter]\nMichelle—Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side, for the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend. You took on a role you didn't ask for and you made it your own, with grace and with grit and with style and good humor. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. So you have made me proud. And you have made the country proud.\nMalia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women. You are smart, and you are beautiful, but more importantly, you are kind, and you are thoughtful, and you are full of passion. And you wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I've done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.\nTo Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware's favorite son, you were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best. Not just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother. And we love you and Jill like family, and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives.\nTo my remarkable staff: For 8 years—and for some of you, a whole lot more—I have drawn from your energy, and every day I tried to reflect back what you displayed: heart and character and idealism. I've watched you grow up, get married, have kids, start incredible new journeys of your own. Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you. You guarded against cynicism. And the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that we've done is the thought of all the amazing things that you are going to achieve from here.\nAnd to all of you out there—every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town, every kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change—you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for, and I will be forever grateful. Because you did change the world. You did.\nAnd that's why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started. Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans, it has inspired so many Americans, especially so many young people out there, to believe that you can make a difference, to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves.\nLet me tell you, this generation coming up—unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic—I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair and just and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands.\nMy fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President, the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me 8 years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours.\nI am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the Moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can.\nYes, we did. Yes, we can.\nThank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-10", "title": "Farewell Address to the Nation From Chicago, Illinois"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120985", "text": "Sean Spicer: Morning. Thanks for being here [inaudible] days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States. It's an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questions.\nAfter the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will — who structured the agreements pursuant to the president's business arrangements and she will give brief remarks.\nBefore we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night. It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.\nAccording to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, \"Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.\"\nThe fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple. One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign. These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and Carter Page.\nCarter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.\nIn fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at — at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it's another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.\nWith that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. [appaluse]\nPence: We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America. [appaluse]\nI am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again. [appaluse]\nNow, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.\nNineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a — it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.\nYou know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it. [appaluse]\nBut today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.\nSo, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump. [appaluse]\nThe President-Elect: Thank you very much.\nIt's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you.\nWe stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that — and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies? Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that. A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released.\nBut I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years — a couple in particular — and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.\nSo, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional — so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK?\nAll right. We've had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies — big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.\nYou saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.\nI appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.\nWe've got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder.\nPharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs. We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.\nAnd we're going to do that with a lot of other industries. I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35, you've been reading about it. And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don't like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I've really gotten to know them well. And we're going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program. And we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better. And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing.\nSo, we've been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no — they're going to do tremendous things — tremendous things in this country. And they're very excited.\nAnd I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else's office. They'd be building and doing things in other countries. So, there's a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever.\nWe're going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really — I'm going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job. And I'm very proud of what we've done.\nAnd we haven't even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It's going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the — all of the bands — or most of the bands are from the different — from the different segments of the military. And I've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible.\nWe're going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.\nIt's a movement like the world has never seen before. It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect. And even the polls — although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't. And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in.\nAnd we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security. They're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.\nAnd by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we'll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he's fantastic — he's fantastic. He will do a truly great job.\nOne of the commitments I made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. Not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen.\nSo, David is going to do a fantastic job. We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we're gonna set up a — a group.\nThese are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they're going to get together with their great doctors — Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.\nIke Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we're gonna straighten out the V.A. for our veterans. I've been promising that for a long time and it's something I feel very, very strongly.\nSo, you'll get the information on David. And I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time — with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.\nOK, questions? Yes, John?\nQuestion: [inaudible] so much.\nThe President-Elect: Thank you.\nQuestion: Appreciate it.\nA couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on.\nThe President-Elect: Sure.\nQuestion: First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC?\nAnd if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?\nThe President-Elect: OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.\nAnd — but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out.\nI saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together — sick people — and they put that crap together.\nSo, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been — number one, shouldn't have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgrace.\nAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I — I can say that you know when — when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.\nWe had — we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world — they were never in the same room together as a group. And we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense.\nAnd I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could've had hacking defense, which we had.\nAnd I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.\nAnd they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.\nWe have to do that for our country. It's very important.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... just to the last part of that question [inaudible] how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin?\nThe President-Elect: Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. They said it totally never happened.\nNow, somebody would say, \"Oh, of course he's gonna say that.\"\nI respected the fact that he said that.\nAnd I — I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it.\nI think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would've released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible.\nIf somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would've fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible.\nBut remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking's bad and it shouldn't be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.\nThat Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? That's a horrible thing. That's a horrible thing.\nCan you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate — it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would've said immediately, \"You have to get out of the race.\" Nobody even talked about it. It's a very terrible thing.\nYeah?\nQuestion: Can I ask you a question, sir?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nOn that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.\nDo you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?\nThe President-Elect: Well, if — if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed.\nIf Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability.\nNow, I don't know that I'm gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't. And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break.\nOK?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... President Obama...[crosstalk]... make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable...[crosstalk]\nWould a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies?\nThe President-Elect: Lemme just tell you what I do.\nWhen I leave our country, I'm a very high-profile person, would you say?\nI am extremely careful. I'm surrounded by bodyguards. I'm surrounded by people.\nAnd I always tell them — anywhere, but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country, \"Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras.\" I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.\nAnd number one, \"I hope you're gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know. You better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.\"\nI tell this to people all the time.\nI was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well — Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.\nAnd I told many people, \"Be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.\"\nAnd again, not just Russia, all over.\nDoes anyone really believe that story?\nI'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me. [laughter] [crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business. But first, I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarks.\nBased on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?\nThe President-Elect: So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia.\nAs a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are — and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt — I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all.\nAnd I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.\nNow, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai — a number of deals and I turned it down.\nI didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is — I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have. But I don't want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don't have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don't think he'll need it, I have a feeling he's not going to need it.\nBut I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don't want presidents getting — I understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.\nI don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can't do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company — the country. I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that.\nNow, all of these papers that you see here — yes, go ahead.\nQuestion: [inaudible] do you believe the hacking was justified? And will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia?\nThe President-Elect: I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they're under audit.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir...\nThe President-Elect: You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They're the only who ask.\nQuestion: You don't think the American public is concerned about it?\nThe President-Elect: No I don't think so. I won, when I became president. No, I don't think they care at all. I don't think they care at all. [appaluse]\nThe President-Elect: I think you care — I think you care. First of all, you learn very little to a tax return. What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it.\nAnd what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They're not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don't have to do this. They're not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go — these papers are just some of the many documents that I've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.\n[crosstalk]\nSheri Dillion: Good morning. It's my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trump's request.\nHe's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking. As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.\nPresident-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.\nHe further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.\nAs he said, he's voluntarily taking this on. The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It's Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president.\nEven so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.\nCritical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.\nMr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.\nI'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, President-elect Trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the — as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions.\nSecond, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.\nFurther, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides — that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.\nPresident-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.\nFurther, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.\nThe president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.\nSecond, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.\nThrough instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust — President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.\nThe trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.\nThe president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could — and I emphasize could — be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.\nThe ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.\nTo further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting.\nAnother step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.\nHe has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump's role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.\nIn sum, all of these actions — complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights — will sever President-elect Trump's presidency from the Trump Organization.\nSome have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.\nSelling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization's assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.\nFurther, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.\nPresident-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn't even feasible.\nSome people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.\nSome people have suggested that the Trump — that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.\nSome people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump — it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal.\nI'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That's a word I think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.\nAnd we're gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.\nEmoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \"officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\"\nThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.\nNo one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.\nBut since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of.\nThese people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument.\nThe Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.\nSo, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.\nIn sum, I and president-elect's other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.\nWe believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.\nThe American people were well — well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.\nPresident-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you. [appaluse]\n[crosstalk]\nDillon: You're welcome. My pleasure. Yes. Don't want to lose your note. Thank you.\nThe President-Elect: Thank you very much. Here you go, you.\nDillon: Thank you.\nQuestion: Mr. Trump? Thank you. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] from America News.\nWhat is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest?\nAnd do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your — your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...\n[crosstalk]\nThe President-Elect: I — I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in — I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson. I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying.\nI watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday.\nSo, I really think that they are — I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we've been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy.\nYou know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there.\nA friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm — big supporter — he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.\nAnd that's what we want. That's what I want to bring to government.\nI want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind. We don't make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster.Trump: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis — hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don't make good deals anymore.\nSo we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart. And that's what I'd put, I'm very proud of the Cabinet, I think they're doing very well.\nIt's very interesting how it's going, but it's — I think they're doing very, very well.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... a quick follow-up on — on Russia, sir.\nThank you, Mr. President-elect. I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare?\nThe President-Elect: Yeah.\nQuestion: Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or...\n[crosstalk]\nThe President-Elect: Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked.\nQuestion: [off-mike] though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law?\nThe President-Elect: You're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.\nThey can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit.\nSome states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year. It's going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people.\nWe could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically. They own it right now.\nSo the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.\nIt'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.\nSo we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.\nObamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service.\nSo as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: President-elect, can we just ask you — sir, sir...\nPresident-elect Trump...[crosstalk]\nMr. President — which one?\nThe President-Elect: I was going right here.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: President-elect Trump, Jon Steinberg from Cheddar. When you look at all the meetings that you've had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce?\nAnd then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?\nThe President-Elect: Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier. And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.\nAnd they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were — that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.Trump: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we've been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it's not going to happen that way anymore.\nYou want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border — not a weak border like it is — we don't even have a border. It's an open sieve.\nBut you're going to sell through a very strong border — not going to happen. You're going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.\nYou can do anywhere — you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition away. You've got a lot of places you can move. And I don't care, as along as it's within the United States, the borders of the United States.\nThere will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are — 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number — that's the real number.\nSo, that's the way it is. OK. Go ahead.\nQuestion: President-elect, I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security. But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning. Are we living in Nazi Germany? What were you driving at there? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community?\nAnd on the Supreme Court, what's your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What's your timeline for nominating?\nAnd on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to...\nThe President-Elect: That's not clear at all. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... to get Mexico to pay for it?\nThe President-Elect: I've got it. Do you have any more? [laughter]\nOn the fence — it's not a fence. It's a wall. You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don't want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin.\nI don't feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. We're going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment — probably less likely that it's a payment. But it will happen.\nSo, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out — 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don't like to report that, but that's OK.\nOK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees.\nBut I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, \"Mexico.\"\nNow, reports went out last week — oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What's the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don't want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.\nAnd by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They're phenomenal people.\nThe government of Mexico is terrific. I don't blame them for what's happened. I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn't have allowed that to happen. It's not going to happen anymore.\nSo, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK?\nSupreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I've gone through them. We've met with numerous candidates. They're outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he's a fantastic guy.Trump: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I'll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we'll also be doing some — some pretty good signings and I think what we'll do is we'll wait until Monday.\nThat will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day — and you'll all be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you're all invited.\nBut on the Supreme Court, I'll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it's one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.\nQuestion: The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there? What are you trying to tell the American public?\nThe President-Elect: I think it was disgraceful — disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it's a disgrace, and I say that — and I say that, and that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\nAs far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up — and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen — I was being — Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He's a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohen they we're talking about. So all night long it's Michael Cohen.\nI said, \"I want to see your passport.\" He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn't leave the country. He wasn't out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It's a disgrace what took place. It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.\nQuestion: Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question? Mr. President-elect —\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization...\nThe President-Elect: Not you.\nQuestion: Can you give us a chance?\nThe President-Elect: Your organization is terrible.\nQuestion: You are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? Sir, can you...\nThe President-Elect: Quiet.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, can you say...\nThe President-Elect: He's asking a question, don't be rude. Don't be rude.\nQuestion: Can you give us a question since you're attacking us? Can you give us a question?\nThe President-Elect: Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a question. I'm not going to give you a question.\nQuestion: Can you state...\nThe President-Elect: You are fake news. Go ahead.\nQuestion: Sir, can you state categorically that nobody — no, Mr. President-elect, that's not appropriate.\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead. [appaluse]\nQuestion: Do you think President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking?\nThe President-Elect: I don't think he went too far. No.\nQuestion: Will you roll them back? What do you think of Lindsey Graham's plan to send you a bill for...\nThe President-Elect: Plans to send me a bill for what?\nQuestion: Tougher sanctions.\nThe President-Elect: I hadn't heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that. Lindsey Graham. I've been competing with him for a long time. He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day. I didn't realize Lindsey Graham still had it. That's all right. I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy. I've heard that he is a nice guy and I've been hearing it.\nGo ahead. Go ahead. You've been waiting.\nQuestion: As far as we understand, the intelligence community...\nThe President-Elect: Stand up.\nQuestion: From BBC news. Ian Pannell from BBC news.\nThe President-Elect: BBC news. That's another beauty.\nQuestion: Thank you. Thank you.\nAs far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...\nThe President-Elect: There's nothing they could come back with.\nQuestion: Can you...\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead.\nQuestion: [inaudible] published fake news and all the problems that we've seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I don't recommend reforms. I recommend people that are — that have some moral compass.\nYou know, I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won't bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They're very, very dishonest people, but I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.Trump: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this — doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back. It's a very sad thing. I've seen people destroyed. I've seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it's very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters.\nYes?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U.S. intelligence community. And be very clear about what you're saying. Do you trust your U.S. intelligence officials? And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?\nThe President-Elect: Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats. We're going to be putting in some outstanding people. Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking.\nI want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly — because we're hacked by everybody — you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it's number 17, in terms of protection.\nIf you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries — they put this in the category of an industry — the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.\nThat's why we weren't hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren't able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.\nThe Democratic National Committee didn't do that. Maybe that's why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you — wait — wait — wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena — fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.\nThat includes Russia and China and everybody — everybody. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead — go ahead.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta's e-mails, et cetera.\nThe President-Elect: All right, but you know what, it could have been others also.\nQuestion: But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it's pretty sad. First of all, it's illegal. You know, these are — these are classified and certified meetings and reports.\nI'll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody's leaking it out. So, there's — maybe it's my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it's them. And what I did is I said I won't tell anybody. I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.\nAnd what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know — I didn't tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.\nSo, I don't want that — I don't want that. It's very unfair to the country. It's very unfair to our country; what's happened. That report should have never — first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.\nI thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. President-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now?\nThe President-Elect: He shouldn't be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it. You will see that. Russia will respect our country more. He shouldn't have done it. I don't believe that he will be doing it more now.\nWe have to work something out, but it's not just Russia. Take a look at what's happened. You don't report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that's because we have no defense. That's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing.Trump: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I'm leading it and I believe and I hope — maybe it won't happen, it's possible. But I won't be giving a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There's no reset button. We're either going to get along or we're not. I hope we get along, but if we don't, that's possible too.\nBut Russia and other countries — and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.\nI want to thank everybody. So this is all — just so you understand, these papers — because I'm not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I'll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I'll say, \"You're fired.\"\nGood-bye, everybody. Good-bye.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference in New York City"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120991", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:11 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: After last night's late arrival, we're moving a little slower than usual today. So appreciate your patience. I do not have any statements at the top, Josh, so we can go straight to questions if you want to kick us off.\nQ: Sure, thanks, Josh. Let me start with the summary that was provided to President-elect Trump last week about -- by the intelligence community about unsubstantiated compromising information that was obtained by Russia. Was President Obama also briefed by the IC either on paper or in person about that report?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, what I can tell you is that as a general matter I've not been in a position to read out publicly the details of the intelligence briefings that the President receives. What I have previously confirmed, though, is that President Obama did receive a briefing on the report that was compiled by the intelligence community at the President's direction on Russia's nefarious activities to undermine public confidence in the 2016 election. The President received that briefing the day before the unclassified version of that report was released. That was last Thursday. But for the contents of that briefing, or for the contents of the classified report, for that matter, that's not something I can speak to.\nQ: Without getting into the content of it, what you were just discussing was information that was provided to the President about Russia's cyber interference with the U.S. campaign. This seems to be slightly different. This isn't about John Podesta's emails or hacking the DNC. This would be about trying to obtain compromising information on Trump. Without talking about the details of it, can you say whether that was part of the briefing that the President received?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that gets -- you're asking me directly about the content of the report. And as we discussed before, it's certainly understandable that people would be interested in trying to understand what's included there, but that's just not something that I can discuss.\nJust to clarify one aspect of your question, the report that was released does discuss in detail the malicious cyber activity that was perpetrated by Russia on political entities in the United States -- in both parties, by the way -- to undermine public confidence in the election. But that wasn't the only tactic that they used. Certainly the release of that hacked material -- there's a discussion of this fake news phenomenon in the report, as well -- so it's important to understand that the report that was compiled by the intelligence community goes beyond just the malicious cyber activity that Russia engaged in.\nQ: You talked quite a bit from the podium about the importance of a smooth transition, and the President has, as well. Is this administration doing anything to try to stem what appears to be significant leaks from the intelligence community aimed at punching back at Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I think I'm on the record as much as anybody in talking about the need to protect classified information. And there are previous situations in which I've expressed concern about the willingness of individuals to talk about classified activity publicly -- or classified information publicly, and I don't have the luxury of doing that. I stand before all of you speaking on the record, on camera, and I have a responsibility to protect classified information.\nThere are other people who use the cloak of anonymity to disseminate that information, and that's something that has happened not just throughout this presidency, but that's something that's been happening certainly over the course of many previous Presidents as well. That's not to okay it, but it certainly is a frequent occurrence.\nQ: And it's one thing to sort of talk publicly about the need to protect classified information. It's another thing to do something proactively to try to stop what appears to be leaks. Certainly there have been other instances where news organizations or others who receive leaks there have been investigations by this administration into that. So I'm just curious whether the White House is going back to these people and saying, you've got to button this up, you can't be doing this. Or is it just sort of talking about it from the podium?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a couple of things, Josh. I think, first of all, the White House has been extraordinarily conscientious in protecting classified information. And that is something that the President expects, particularly with regard to leaks. And the President is proud of that.\nWith regard to leak investigations, all of you have talked about -- rather critically, in fact -- some of the efforts that the administration has undertaken to protect classified information. Questions about prosecuting individuals who are engaging in criminal conduct or leaking information that is punishable under the criminal law, those kinds of prosecutorial investigative decisions are made at the FBI. And those decisions are made free of any sort of political interference, and certainly made free of any interference from the White House. But I've said on a number of occasions that I believe it's important for everybody in the U.S. government who's entrusted with access to classified information to uphold their oath to protect it.\nQ: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- nominee Rex Tillerson was on the Hill -- is on the Hill today, testifying. And he's suggesting that he could be even tougher on Russia than the Obama administration in certain respects. Particularly, he said that what the administration should have done after Russia seized Crimea was to send defensive weapons and air surveillance assets to the Ukrainians. Is the outgoing administration sufficiently convinced that Tillerson, if confirmed, would be tough enough on Russia, and do you have any response to sort of his second-guessing of the way that this administration handled the Ukraine issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with regard to appraising Mr. Tillerson's candidacy, I'll leave that to the men and women of the United States Senate to evaluate. It's their responsibility to determine whether or not this is an individual who is capable of representing the United States and serving in the President's cabinet.\nAnd that's why we have a process where the United States Senate offers advice and consent to the President in choosing those nominees, and that certainly is why those nominees have to undergo rigorous background checks, comply with ethical regulations that ensure that they don't have conflicts of interest that could impact their judgment or raise questions about their judgment. And this is also why the Congress holds hearings to try to understand how a nominee would approach some of these issues once in office.\nBut I'm going to leave to individual members of the Senate to pass judgment. That's not something that I'll do from here. It certainly would undermine our commitment to a smooth and effective transition if I spent a lot of time critiquing the performance of the nominees when they're testifying before Congress.\nWith regard to the policy that we have used in Ukraine, what I can tell you is that this administration has been strongly supportive of the efforts of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government to counter flagrant attempts by the Russians to violate their sovereignty and their territorial integrity. And there are a variety of forms of assistance that the United States has provided -- certainly extensive financial assistance to try to strengthen their economy.\nObviously President Obama had been a leading advocate in communicating with the world and in communicating with Russia about the need to resolve this conflict and certainly to deescalate it. And the President has been strongly supportive of the efforts of European leaders to pursue a process to try to broker a diplomatic agreement between Ukraine and Russia.\nImplementing that agreement has been challenging and we've not made nearly as much progress on that score as we would like. The United States has also worked closely with our allies in Europe to impose tough sanctions against Russia that we know have had a negative impact on Russia's economy. And we do know that since those sanctions were put in place, Russia's economy has been faltering. Some of that is because of the global price of oil, but limiting their access to international financial markets and limiting their access to some of their most prominent and important trading partners surely hasn't helped. And that's a price that Russia has had to pay.\nRussia, based on a decision that was made by the United States and our allies, is not participating in G8 meetings anymore. Those meetings are now called G7 meetings, and Russia doesn't participate. So Russia has faced intense isolation because of their flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\nSo our response to Russia's involvement in Ukraine has been tough. It has had an impact, and there have been negative consequences. But ultimately, if the incoming administration chooses to escalate that situation militarily, that would be a different conclusion than this administration reached with regard to our interests and the interests of our friends in Ukraine. But somebody else will be calling those shots in the afternoon of January 20th.\nQ: And just lastly, did the President catch any of the President-elect's news conference today?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that President Obama had an opportunity to watch the news conference live, but I'm confident that he's following the news coverage of it.\nJulia.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. One of the things that President-elect Trump touched on today was he actually said that he does think that Russia was behind the hack into the DNC. That was really the furthest he's come on that subject so far.\nMR. EARNEST: He also said it could be others -- at the end of it.\nQ: Sure. But the point he then followed with is that it was an equal opportunity hack; that, really, the reason why the DNC was exposed was because the RNC just had better cyber protections in place. Is it your understanding that both parties were equally targeted in these cyber intrusions during the campaign, and it just came down to a matter of security? Or was it more targeted than that?\nMR. EARNEST: Julia, I think what I would do is I would just point you to the key judgments of the report that was issued by the intelligence community last week. And in these key judgments -- let me just read one sentence, one bullet from those key judgments. It simply says, \"Russia's intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 presidential election, including targets associated with both major U.S. political parties.\" So that is the judgment of the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA that compiled this report with the support of the Director of National Intelligence. So I do think it is another illustration of the Russian motive.\nAnd this is another finding of the report about the clear assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's aim was to disadvantage Secretary Clinton and give a boost to Mr. Trump's campaign. That certainly would explain the aggressive effort to hack Democrats and the refusal to release information about Republicans in a damaging way that had also been obtained by the Russians.\nQ: But should the DNC have gone further to protect itself or to cooperate with the FBI?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll refer you to the DNC for what sort of cooperation was in place with regard to the FBI. And I also can't speak to what sort of cyber defenses they had in place back in 2015. That's something that they can speak to.\nQ: One thing I'm wondering if you could speak to as well from the press conference was President-elect Trump's moves to distance himself from his business interests by placing his business in the hands of his sons, but he did not go so far as to completely divest or to set up a blind trust. He's bringing in an ethics advisor. Could you say whether or not the White House thinks that that goes far enough to really separate the future President from any conflicts of interest when he takes office?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm obviously not in a position to offer any sort of expert judgment or analysis of the steps that the President-elect announced earlier today. All I can tell you is that President Obama chose a very different approach. I would acknowledge at the front end that their financial situations are quite different, but President Obama's approach was quite different, nonetheless. And President Obama's approach was to liquidate virtually all of his assets and put them into Treasury bills.\nAnd as I've observed on a couple of occasions, that was a very good decision for the country. It was a very poor decision for the financial standing of the Obama family. This was a time when the Federal Reserve was slashing interest rates to deal with the Great Recession, and that made the return on Treasury bills very small. But President Obama was pleased to make the financial sacrifice because it was in the best interest of the country. He also believed that it ended up serving the administration quite well.\nEssentially, he set a standard at the very top that everyone else in his administration has also followed. And President Obama is quite proud of the fact that there has not been a major personal or ethical scandal during his eight years in office. And some of that is because of the ethical -- of the tone that he set from the earliest days of his presidency about the extraordinarily high ethical standard that he and other senior members of his administration would be following.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. During the press conference today, President-elect Trump said that the intelligence community was disgraceful to let out the information that was published in BuzzFeed. He compared the intelligence community to Nazi Germany. I wonder if you have any response to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, as President Obama has said many times, the men and women of our intelligence community are patriots. They do their important work not because the paycheck is large -- many of them are experts that could command a much higher salary in the private sector. They aren't engaged in this work because they're going to get a lot of personal glory and credit for their service -- most of the men and women who serve in the intelligence community actually do their work in secret. Their identities will never be known. We will never have an opportunity to thank them personally for their service and sacrifice for this country.\nThese are men and women who served our country under Democratic and Republican Presidents, and they made a decision when they began their career to set aside their own personal and ideological views, and focus solely on the facts, and focus solely on marshaling and presenting the most insightful analysis and the most accurate, relevant and timely facts to the President and other national security decision-makers so that they can make the best decisions about what's necessary to protect the country.\nAnd the leadership of the intelligence under President Obama reflects that lifetime commitment to service. And there were some not-so-subtle references to questioning the integrity and motives of the leaders of the intelligence community.\nJim Clapper serves as the Director of National Intelligence -- has for almost six years now. He's somebody who enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961. Since then he's been serving his country. He flew dozens of combat missions over Southeast Asia as a pilot, and he is somebody who has served Presidents in both parties as a high-ranking military official and as a high-ranking official in our intelligence community.\nCertainly somebody like Jim Comey, the Director of the FBI, was a high-ranking political appointee of the Bush administration. He was somebody who was confirmed almost unanimously in the United States Senate. Strong majorities of Democrats and Republicans signed up to support him because of his well-established reputation for integrity. That certainly is the reason that President Obama chose him for the job.\nAnd similar things can be said about John Brennan, who dedicated more than two decades of his career to serving our country in the CIA. That included some service in countries overseas with whom the United States has very sensitive, complicated relationships, and he served Presidents in both parties.\nAdmiral Mike Rogers, Director of the NSA, is somebody who has had a distinguished career in the United States military, and he has held those senior positions -- a variety of senior positions under Presidents in both parties.\nSo I think it is deeply misguided for anybody, at any level, to question the integrity and motives of the patriots who serve in our intelligence community. Doesn't mean they're always right, but questioning their motives is another thing altogether.\nQ: I also wanted to ask what this administration thinks about Vladimir Putin and whether he's a war criminal. That's a question that came up in the hearings for Secretary of State. Rex Tillerson seemed to not want to use that label to describe Putin. Is that something that this administration believes is appropriate for a label for Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that that designation or that label has been used by any senior officials in this administration. Obviously we have, on a number of occasions, expressed profound concern about some of the tactics used by the Russian government under the leadership of President Putin. The willingness of the Russian government to punish journalists, to target political opponents, has created a human rights situation in Russia that's troubling. But I've not heard anybody apply that label -- at least nobody in the Obama administration apply that label to him.\nQ: One more on -- Trump basically said during his press conference that Obamacare was imploding on its own and Democrats should be happy that he's putting for -- he's going to put forward a plan to vote to repeal it and replace the law simultaneously. What's your reaction to that? And do you have a preference for whether or not there is a gap between repeal and replace, or whether it's done, you know, as he said, on the same week or on the same day?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is certainly true is to repeal the law without a replacement would create chaos not just for those Americans who purchased their health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace, but for all Americans, including the vast majority of Americans who purchase their health insurance through their employer.\nTo repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement would inject an unprecedented level of uncertainty into the broader health care market. This is a significant portion of our economy we're talking about here. So that would be a really bad thing for the country. It would be bad for our economy. It certainly would be bad for millions of Americans who rely on their health insurance to protect their family's financial situation but also to protect their own health.\nWith regard to the plans that are put forward by the incoming administration, you've heard me say this before -- I'll give you the short version, and it's simply this. At some point -- based on the President-elect's comments today, that point may come sooner rather than later -- I would expect that the incoming Secretary of the Health and Human Services, Mr. Price, if he's confirmed, will be standing before you, maybe even right at this podium, in this room, to present the health care plan that was put forward by the Trump administration. And what I would urge you to do is to evaluate that plan on its merits.\nPresident Obama, with Obamacare, has established an extraordinarily high benchmark. Since President Obama signed that bill into law, 20 million more Americans got access to health care. These are Americans that didn't previously have health insurance coverage that do now. That has reduced the uninsured rate in this country to historic lows.\nWhat we have also seen is we have limited the growth in employer premiums to 3.4 percent last year. That's a much lower inflation rate than before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes sweeping protections for people that have a preexisting condition, for women who previously could be charged more by their insurance company just because they are women -- that's something that has been outlawed. Parents can now keep their children on their health insurance up until age 26. That was previously not an option available before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.\nThe Affordable Care Act extended the life of Medicare by 11 years. And the Affordable Care Act, according to independent projections by the CBO, would reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over the next two decades. That's a substantial savings.\nAnd the President actually said this last night -- you've all got it on tape -- if the Trump administration can put forward a plan that would exceed these benchmarks and do so at a lower cost, President Obama will support it. So we'll have an opportunity to see if the Trump administration is up to the task.\nLeland.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A question about the speech from last night. The President talked about major threats to our democracy, and in that he listed a number of things and they were reminiscent, if you will, of past criticisms of Mr. Trump. And what I'm wondering is, if you connect those dots, was the President saying that Mr. Trump is a threat to our democracy, or are his followers, based on those things?\nMR. EARNEST: Leland, I can tell you that the President's message was focused on the American people, and urging the American people to be engaged in our democracy to counter the threats, both external to the United States but also some of those threats internally.\nAnd certainly our country has overcome significant internal divisions before -- some even greater than the kind of political divide that we see on display in our current political debate. But the President was making the case to the country -- both to his supporters and those who do not support him -- that the most effective way to overcome those divisions is for us to look for common ground with our fellow citizens, to assume the best, and to engage in the hard work of democracy, of advocating for the kinds of solutions that will move the country forward.\nAnd the President believes that if the American people pursue that approach, that our country is in -- the future for our country is as bright as it's ever been. And part of the President's optimism is rooted in this spirit that he has seen in the younger generation of Americans who are committed to fairness and justice and equality, and are civic-minded. They wanted to see our country succeed and they want to see everyone in our country have an opportunity to get a fair shot and a fair shake. And that gives the President a lot of optimism about the future. But it's going to require a lot of hard work, and the President indicated that he was prepared to engage in that hard work as a citizen himself.\nQ: And speaking of something the President might be wanting to work on, he said that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 years ago. He said he doesn't need statistics, although he alluded that statistics might support that. ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll -- 30 percent of people in 2000 said race relations were generally bad. When the President was elected in 2008, 36 percent: generally bad. Today, 63 percent: generally bad. So what is the President or the White House pointing to showing that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 years ago that this poll doesn't suggest?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think that the President didn't have polling data in mind. I think the President had in mind other metrics about the success that we've had in closing the achievement gap; in increasing the percentage of Americans from minority groups that are enrolled in college, for example. We've had some success in closing the wealth gap. There's more work to be done, but we certainly have moved that in a positive direction.\nI think what those polls reflect are actually a somewhat different phenomenon, which is simply that in a modern age, in a modern communications environment, where everybody has got a video-equipped cellphone in their pocket, that we all too often come face to face with the most graphic elements of the racial divide in this country that have yet to be healed. And that's disconcerting. In some cases, it's even discouraging to some Americans. And I think that would explain some of the poll results that you've seen. But the truth is, those kinds of incidents -- whether they are confrontations between law enforcement officers and young minorities, or a response to those kinds of incidents that show some significant civic discontent and even unrest -- I think is disconcerting to a large portion of the population and prompts some people to despair about the state of race relations in our country.\nThe truth is, those kinds of things have been happening for generations -- these kinds of confrontations between law enforcement and minorities. That's not a new thing. The difference now is that we see it in vivid detail, and our conscience is aroused by that, both out of concern for the safety and security of our brave men and women who serve honorably to protect our communities, but also out of concern for the fair treatment and basic civil rights of people, regardless of the color of their skin.\nAnd the fact that that is not a concern that is just held by Hispanics and African Americans, but rather a concern that the vast majority of Americans of all races hold, I think is also, in and of itself, an illustration of the progress that we've made in making our country as fair and as just as we would like it to be. But I think the President -- the passion in the President's speech was rooted in not just an acknowledgment that there's more work to do, but in a commitment to engage in the difficult work of addressing some of those challenges. And the President looks forward to doing that as a citizen.\nJohn.\nQ: Throughout the campaign, the President consistently questioned really whether President-elect Trump was prepared to assume the office of the presidency. I'm wondering now if that assessment has changed at all. He said during the campaign that the presidency is not a reality TV program. Nine days out, does the President think that he's ready?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard the President put forward an assessment like that. And the President has strong feelings about this -- he expressed them vividly over the summer and fall of the presidential campaign. Those sentiments, that opinion was rooted in the President's values about what's best for the country. They were also rooted in his own personal experience of serving as President of the United States for the last eight years. But the opportunity to make those arguments and to put forward that kind of assessment expired on Election Day. In the aftermath of the election, President Obama accepted responsibility for putting aside his own personal political views and focusing on the kind of smooth and effective transition that the American people are counting on.\nPresident Obama, just last night, talked about how much he and his administration benefitted from the professionalism and courtesy and selflessness of the Bush administration as they were transitioning out of office. I'm confident that President Bush had frustrations and concerns and deep disagreements with the approach that the incoming Obama administration was prepared to pursue, but they were insistent that they were not going to allow those differences of opinion to affect their ability to give President Obama and his team every opportunity to get a running start when they entered the White House.\nAnd President Obama made it a priority earlier this year, before the -- or early last year, before the outcome of the election was known, that regardless of who succeeded him in office, he wanted his team to be prepared to engage in a smooth and effective transition so that the incoming President could have every opportunity to succeed. And that's what we've been doing since November 9th, the day after the election.\nQ: You said on Thursday and Friday of last week that the President had no plans to phone Donald Trump to talk about the briefing that they each received. Do you know whether they've spoken since last Thursday at all?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned before, I'm going to protect the ability of the President and the President-elect to consult in private, so I don't have any specific telephone calls to tell you about.\nQ: On another subject, there are a lot of reports out indicating that as the President's time in office winds down, that Chelsea Manning may be pardoned or sentence commuted. I'm wondering if you have any update on any of that legal question. And I have a follow-up question.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have additional information to share about this. I've refrained from commenting on specific clemency applications that have been filed with the Department of Justice. I was asked just last week about whether or not the President intended to act on the clemency petition that had been put forward by attorneys for former Illinois governor, Rod Blagojevich -- I didn't have any comment on that situation, and I don't have any commentary on any of the paperwork involving Chelsea Manning either.\nQ: On April 21st, 2011, the President was talking about then Bradley Manning's case and said, \"We are a nation of laws. We don't let individuals make decisions about how the law operates.\" He said, \"He broke the law.\" Does the President still believe that Chelsea Manning broke the law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, more importantly, it's not the President's responsibility to serve as judge and jury. Chelsea Manning, as a member of the United States armed forces, went through a legal proceeding administered by the United States military under the laws that govern the conduct of members of the United States military, and there was a hearing and a conviction and a sentence. And it all went through that regular process. And that's the way we determine guilt or innocence in this country, particularly with regard to the conduct of men and women in our armed forces. And that's the way that our system works.\nQ: And my final question is, yesterday a Cubs official confirmed to me that the team will come to the White House on Monday to be honored for their World Series Championship. I'm hoping to --\nMR. EARNEST: You've got good sources.\nQ: Thank you. I'm hoping you can confirm that news and maybe tell me if it was difficult to arrange that visit in the last few days of the presidency.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the thing I can tell you, John, is that one of the highlights of my eight years of working in the White House was, earlier this summer, when my hometown Kansas City Royals came to the White House to celebrate their World Series Championship with President Obama. And I'm pleased to confirm that many of my colleagues here in the West Wing who are themselves Cub fans will get to enjoy exactly the same thing when the Chicago Cubs come to the White House on Monday to celebrate their World Series Championship with President Obama.\nThose of us who were -- I, of course, was disappointed that my Royals didn't make the playoffs. But I think anybody who is a sports fan, even if you're not a baseball fan and not a Cubs fan, appreciated the historic run that the Chicago Cubs had through the playoffs and to a World Series title this year. Obviously a seven-game series, that was historic and exciting, and this is a young team that's equipped to make many future visits to the White House I think.\nSo the President is really looking forward to it. I'm not aware that we've encountered any unexpected challenge in trying to schedule this visit. In fact, this visit is actually being scheduled earlier than normal. For example, the Royals obviously won in November of 2015 and they didn't visit the White House until July of the next year. The Cubs are coming just a couple of months after securing their World Series title, and I think that's an indication that we've been able to work effectively with the front office of the Chicago Cubs to schedule a visit. And I know President Obama and other members of the White House staff are really looking forward to it.\nJared.\nQ: Josh, not in the context of last week's briefing, but in the context of a news story over the last 24 hours, have you seen -- has the President seen the reports from CNN, from BuzzFeed, from Mother Jones about this allegation about compromising information for the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was quite busy last evening while this news broke, but I'm sure -- so he was not reading it in real time as this information was being reported. But the President is certainly aware of the news reports and has read many of them.\nQ: What is -- is there any reaction that the President has? Have you spoken to him since that? I know that NBC News got a chance to ask him a little bit about this on the plane, but have you talked to him about any of these details, any reaction to what's included in this? Again, not about what may or may not have been included last week in the confidential briefing, but in this as a news story?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific presidential reaction to share with you. I know the President did have an opportunity to talk to Lester Holt of NBC about this briefly last evening before the speech. But I don't have anything to add to it beyond what the President said.\nQ: In the press conference today, the President-elect said that because the presidency cannot have conflicts of interest in law, he basically -- his argument was conflating it and saying that therefore there is no ability for the presidency to have a conflict of interest. That's not true, is it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm no government ethics expert, but that seems like a tough case to make even to somebody who is not steeped in those kinds of details.\nQ: And one last one. Again, this is not trying to get you to confirm or deny anything from the confidential briefing last week, but the President, on the campaign trail leading up to Election Day, expressed a lot of certitude about what the American people would choose on November 8th. Was that based on his impression of Donald Trump, the prima facie case that Trump was making to the people? Or was there something that he knew that either in the back of his mind or in the forefront of his mind said this is just -- this is something that -- can you give us a little bit more about that certitude and why it existed?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President was expressing exactly the same kind of certitude that most of you thought -- not because I'm suggesting that you're biased in any way, but based on your own analysis of the political environment. Just about every public poll indicated that Secretary Clinton was likely to win. Many of those public polls indicated that she was likely to win rather handily. But that's not the way it turned out.\nSo the President was disappointed by that outcome. He was surprised by the outcome. But the American people spoke, and he set aside his own political differences with the incoming President to ensure a smooth and effective transition, and he's asked his team to do the same thing. And the President and his team have delivered on that promise.\nQ: Was classified information about Donald Trump a factor in President Obama's confidence in what he thought was going to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think the President's confidence about what he thought and hoped would happen in the election was driven by a variety of factors. Many of them are his own experience campaigning on the campaign trail, the kind of projections about voter turnout that were coming in from sources around the country. Obviously, public polling and private polling influenced his judgment. I think the President was pleased to see the degree to which his message was resonating on the campaign trail. I think the President believed that Secretary Clinton would have been an excellent President, and that certainly contributed to some of the confidence that he felt. But like most Americans, he was surprised by the outcome.\nJean.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea, North Korea continues to threaten with the nuclear and ICBM to South Korea and the United States. Did President Obama feel he did enough to resolve North Korean nuclear issues while he was President?\nMR. EARNEST: Jean, obviously the situation is not resolved, but President Obama does believe that because of the decisions that he made, the United States is able to protect ourselves from the threat that is emanating from North Korea. The United States is able to protect our allies from the threat that emanates from North Korea. And the United States has succeeded in mobilizing the international community to further pressure and isolate the North Korean regime to persuade them to change course.\nWith regard to the defense of the United States, there's been a significant increase in the military assets that have been deployed to the Asia Pacific, including naval assets with anti-ballistic missile capabilities, to protect the United States. That includes advanced radar systems in places like Guam and Japan. The United States is working closely with the South Korean government to deploy a THAAD battery, another anti-missile battery on South Korean soil, to better protect our South Korean allies.\nThere are a number of naval assets, ships in the Pacific Ocean that are bolstering the defense of the United States, and there's also military equipment that's been deployed to Alaska to also protect the United States. So there have been significant movements of military equipment to protect the U.S. And the President believed that that was prudent given the threat that emanates from North Korea.\nWe've obviously been steadfast in our support of both Japan and South Korea as they counter this threat. Those are our allies that are most directly in harm's way. And our commitment to their national security is resolute, and hopefully that will be the case in the incoming administration. There's a strong reason to believe that it will, but ultimately the incoming President will have to make those kinds of decisions.\nAnd we're pleased that we have succeeded at the end of last year in passing through the United Nations Security Council the toughest-ever sanctions on North Korea. And that required building the diplomatic support not just of our allies in Europe, but also the support of countries like Russia and China, with whom we have some profound differences of agreement -- or differences of opinion in other areas, but with regard to North Korea, we've been able to find common ground in a way that has applied additional pressure and further isolated the North Korean government.\nQ: So North Korea's intent is still valid?\nMR. EARNEST: Our view with regard to North Korea is that they should refrain from the kinds of destabilizing activities that frequently rattle nerves not just in the region but around the world. We believe that North Korea needs to come into compliance with international obligations that relate to their nuclear program because we would like to see the Korean Peninsula be denuclearized. And what we have indicated to North Korea is if they're prepared to take those steps, the international community is prepared to work with them to implement those steps and allow North Korea to begin the process of reentering the global community.\nQ: One more. Recently, North Korean Kim Jong-un proclaimed North Korea will soon launch ICBM anytime, anywhere. Is the United States ready to shoot down ICBM for defense?\nMR. EARNEST: As the Secretary of Defense said over the weekend, the United States has the capability to protect the United States and our allies from the threat that emanates from North Korea, including the capability to shoot down those missiles that could pose a threat to the United States or our allies.\nAndrew.\nQ: Josh, you've worked in the White House for a relatively long time now. Do you think it's a good strategy for an administration to pick fights on kind of multiple fronts with the media, with intelligence agencies, with senators within their own party? Would that be something you would advocate? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it sounds like a bit of a leading question. (Laughter.) But that's okay. Listen, I think what I can tell you is President Obama has pursued a different approach. The President benefitted from a highly effective working relationship with the intelligence community. He was able to obtain timely, relevant and accurate information from the experts in the U.S. intelligence community that aided him and his team greatly as they made important decisions to protect the United States and our interests around the world.\nWith regard to Congress, the administration worked to try to find common ground with Democrats and Republicans. It doesn't mean that the administration got along with Democrats and Republicans at every turn. There are some cases where you're going to have differences of opinion. And I would anticipate that the incoming administration will find the same thing with regard to their relationships both with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\nWith regard to the media, there's been a lot of attention on this in the last couple of months. Our approach has been to engage with all of you. The President believes strongly that an independent, unbiased, professional media is critical to the success of our democracy. And one way we can invest in your efforts to hold people in power accountable is to come out here and answer questions, and to do so on camera, on the record, just about every single day. And President Obama does that himself occasionally. And it's good for the country and it's good for our democracy.\nIt means that all of you have an important role to play. It certainly doesn't mean that we've always gotten along. But it does mean we've been able to function effectively to ensure that our differences of opinion don't affect your ability to do your job. It doesn't affect the ability of the White House to do its job or to effectively engage with the White House Press Corps that is tasked with informing the American people about what's happening around here.\nQ: Were there any times during this administration where you've worried that that kind of bunker mentality was setting in and that was preventing you from getting --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's always a risk to guard against. And this is the example that I've most often cited with regard to our relationship with the media. Our democracy is constructed such that the free and independent media is in place to hold people in power accountable. And that means it's your responsibility as an independent journalist to demand greater access, to demand greater transparency, to demand a better, more effective, more fulsome explanation of what the President is thinking about, what the President is doing and why he's doing it. And that informs your coverage, and that certainly informs your analysis of what exactly is happening.\nNow, there are certainly times -- many times -- where officials in the White House -- sometimes the President, sometimes members of his senior staff, sometimes me -- aren't happy with the way that that information is being portrayed in your reporting or in your analysis. But the goal that I have set is not to suggest that you have a responsibility to write stories that make the White House look good. That's not your job. Your job is to call it as you see it and to provide as much insight as possible about what exactly is happening here at the White House.\nAnd if we're doing a good job, more often than not the President will at least look like he's got the right priorities, based on your readers. But really what we want is we want journalists to use their skills as storytellers, as writers, as journalists to describe to the American people what's happening. And sometimes that's going to make the President look good, and sometimes it's probably not.\nBut when we're dissatisfied or unhappy with the way that some of the coverage is going, there is a temptation to retreat to the bunker and to say, the heck with those guys, to heck with their stories, to heck with what they think, let's just go and do what we think is right. That kind of conviction is admirable, but it's unwise to write off such a critically important element of our democracy. And so that's why I've viewed it as my role to make sure that when tensions do flare up -- I should say, when tensions get a little higher than usual, that it's important for me to make the case to my colleagues not retreat into the bunker, and to continue to engage. Occasionally, I have to make that case to my boss, too.\nBut I also have a responsibility that when you guys get frustrated with us, to engage with you to make sure that that frustration doesn't interfere with your ability to do your job so you don't start writing us off and say, I'm just not going to call those guys, I'm just going write what I want -- to heck with what those guys think. And that's the kind of relationship that I've tried to facilitate here. I think every press secretary has their own approach, and surely my successor is going to have his own approach. But that's the approach that we have taken. And I think the President has been very well served by it, in part because so many people who are in here are so dedicated and experienced and determined to play that important role in our democracy, but also because our administration has a pretty powerful case to make about the virtue of the decisions that we've been making here.\nThe results speak for themselves, in large part. So that's obviously going to make things -- when you have a good story to tell, it's going to make the storyteller look better than if you don't have many results to show for your performance.\nAnd so that's the approach that we have taken. And I don't know if that will be relevant or resonate with the incoming administration, but like I said, I believe that that has served the President well, and I also believe that it's served the country well.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, when you said a moment ago that President Obama feels the opportunity for criticizing President-elect Trump expired on Election Day, do you feel that President-elect Trump is reciprocating when he is critical of the President's policies today, again saying that the administration created ISIS; that Obamacare is a complete and total disaster; that Russia would have more respect for the United States once President-elect Trump is in office?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I noticed some of those comments as well. I'll let the President-elect and his team explain why he made those statements and why he wanted to continue to make the arguments in that way, despite the fact that those arguments don't withstand much scrutiny and there aren't too many facts that are mobilized to support those kinds of arguments.\nAnd to the extent that there's interest in a debate, this administration feels quite proud of the progress that we've been able to make, and the facts of that progress strongly bolster our case and don't do much to substantiate the case that's made by our critics.\nQ: On another issue, can you tell us what kind of packing up is underway in the West Wing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that the packing has begun. You can tell which members of the White House staff are planners because they have made more progress in preparing for their departure nine days from now. There are those of us who will probably be spending some time here over the three-day weekend trying to do that work.\nThe other thing that has begun happening is that members of the White House staff have started rolling off, because obviously the transfer of power has to occur just in a matter of hours so there's has been a staggered roll-off of White House staff that is starting to accelerate. And so the line at the mess is a little bit shorter around lunchtime, and --\nQ: A lot of empty seats in here, too.\nMR. EARNEST: There's more empty seats in here too, yeah. I think you guys are stretched thin as you are covering not just a President of the United States but also a President-elect as well.\nQ: Oh, what else is the President doing today? There's not much on the schedule that you gave us.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, relatively quiet day today. The President has got a couple meetings with staff this afternoon, but obviously given the very busy day that he had yesterday and the very late return back here to the White House, the President's day is, publicly, pretty quiet.\nAthena.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just a couple with possible follows. On this issue of the unconfirmed allegations regarding the President-elect and his team and Russia that CNN and other organizations have reported on -- I'm not asking you about those allegations themselves or what was in them, but the President talked last night about the selective sorting of facts, and he's talked a lot over the past many months about the siloing of news sources, people living in their own bubbles. And then we have this whole idea of fake news -- the definition of which there doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement on because lots of people are using that term as they see fit.\nSo the question is, does the White House feel that BuzzFeed, in publishing these unconfirmed allegations in full, acted appropriately, or did they make it potentially harder for the truth to come out? And going with that, does Trump and his team have a point that these allegations are just another way to delegitimize him?\nMR. EARNEST: With regard to the delegitimizing thing, I think that's the easiest one, so let me just knock that one out of the way, which is I think that what should be evidence to anybody who's even been paying a little bit of attention is that since the election outcome was announced, not just late on the night of November 8th but early in the morning of November 9th, this administration, led by this President, has been dedicated to ensuring a smooth and effective transition with the incoming administration. And with regard to the legitimacy of the election, I think that actions speak much louder than words, and I think that there's just no question about that.\nWith regard to the decision that was made by your news organization, BuzzFeed -- who I think were obviously all making their own independent decisions -- and doing separately and different things, what I'm just suggesting is, is that your news organization was the first news organization to report on this. That obviously was -- I don't have any insight into what sort of editorial decision-making process was implemented to reach that conclusion, but I'm confident that there was one. I assume there was a similar process at BuzzFeed that reached a different conclusion, as you point out.\nBut I guess this is my point: Independent editorial decisions made by independent news organizations should be made independent of government influence.\nOver the last eight years, we've had a variety of circumstances where the administration has expressed some frustration with some of the editorial decisions that were made by your news organizations. We've expressed those concerns sometimes -- not sometimes; frequently. But at each stage, in every conversation that I've ever been a part of about an editorial decision, we have acknowledged at the beginning, middle and end of that conversation that whatever decision is made is one that you all will make. And that reflects the respect this administration has for the constitutional rights of independent media organizations.\nBut there's another element of this that I think warrants mentioning here, which is, obviously, the President-elect and his team are suggesting that the accusations that are being made are totally unfounded, that there's no basis for them. This President has been in a situation in which he has been criticized in an utterly false, baseless way. And I'm, of course, referring to the President's birthplace. There were a wide variety of the President's critics who were suggesting and propagating conspiracy theories that somehow the President wasn't born in the United States, but that he was the object of some grand conspiracy.\nIt's still hard to put together even now as you think about it. But they made those accusations even though the administration had already released the birth certificate, and even though there was contemporaneous news reporting announcing his birth in Hawaii. So the conspiracy theories were propagated even in the face of significant, overwhelming and convincing evidence. But yet, those conspiracy theories continued. And many of those conspiracy theories were centered on the long-form version of the President's birth certificate.\nSo, when faced with that situation, President Obama made a decision. He dispatched an attorney to fly all the way to Hawaii and go to the state archives and engage in a process of obtaining a document that is rarely made public that is not stored in a way that makes it readily accessible to the public. The President's legal team engaged in a process that typically takes weeks and months to obtain that document. And once it was obtained, we released it. In this very room. Handed it out, on paper, to all of you, so that all of you could look at that piece of paper and verify for yourself, to be convinced that the charges that were lobbed against the President were false.\nI point all of this out -- this well-trod path of history -- to just underscore that the incoming administration has chosen a different approach. They've not been transparent. Many of the questions that have been raised have been about potential financial entanglements of the President-elect, his family and his business in Russia. There's ample evidence that they could marshal to make public to refute those claims -- those accusations that they say are baseless, but they've refused to do so.\nThat kind of secrecy only serves to sow public doubt. You'll recall during the campaign, as the President-elect was refusing to release his tax returns, people were saying, what's he hiding? People are asking that question again. And again, all of the available evidence, to the extent that there is any, doesn't actually substantiate their argument that the claims are baseless, because I know at least one member of the Trump family was quoted on the record in the not too distant past saying that the family and the Trump organization had extensive financial ties to Russia.\nSo, ultimately, I think that the incoming administration is going to have to make some decisions about what approach they want to take. And again, this is an imperfect analogy -- I'll just stipulate that at the top -- but the difference in approach that we have taken has been starkly different. We expressed great frustration about critics repeating that information even though there was plenty of publicly available evidence to indicate that it was false. We expressed some deep frustration to you and your news organizations about the way that you were handling those accusations. But ultimately, what we sought to do was to uncover and release information to substantiate our case.\nAnd the incoming President has pursued a different approach -- not just by trying to meet the bare standard of transparency, but to fall way short of it, and to refuse to meet that same standard that many previous Presidents have met by releasing tax returns.\nSo, with regard to the tactics and strategy that they're employing to deal with this situation, it's quite different than the one that this administration has implemented. And given the President's election and reelection, even as the storm of these charges was swirling, I think that would be a pretty good validation of the approach that we have chosen, setting aside the intrinsic benefit to the American people of the incoming administration living up to standard of transparency that was set by previous Presidents.\nQ: You raised a lot of points, so I'll combine my follow with the only other question I have, which is --\nMR. EARNEST: I appreciate you indulging me.\nQ: Just to be clear, I want to make it clear, the administration doesn't have a viewpoint or any stance on whether or not it is helpful to the pursuit of the truth for an organization to publish unsubstantiated allegations. I just want to make sure that I know what --\nMR. EARNEST: On principle, the administration deeply respects and will protect the right of independent news organizations to make their own editorial decisions. It doesn't mean that we agree with all of them. There are many situations in which we have not. But we respect and will stipulate from the beginning that independent news organizations should make editorial decisions independent of any sort of government interference.\nQ: That's sounds different from -- for months, though, when publications were reporting on the leaks during the last months of the campaign, you guys were saying from the podium shouldn't these news organizations not be doing that. So are you --\nMR. EARNEST: Actually, I didn't. I walked this fine line of saying -- when I was asked about John Podesta's emails, for example -- these were emails that were leaked by DCLeaks, which we knew before the election was actually consistent with the kinds of efforts that were undertaken by Russia to sow doubt about our democracy. What I said at every turn was to stipulate that those materials were stolen. I said that independent news organizations are going to have to make their own editorial decisions about whether or not to publish them, or how to describe them publicly.\nAnd in most situations, given the fact that they were stolen, I declined to respond -- or to react to them. There were a couple of situations in which I did. But at each turn I stipulated that while the material was stolen -- and I think that does indicate, potentially, difference of opinion with the editorial judgement that was being exercised by news organizations. I, at every turn, stipulated that it was their decision to make.\nAnd look, I think news organizations who are looking back at this episode have already concluded and expressed some remorse about the way they handled it. It was The New York Times who described American news organizations, including the New York Times, as essentially weaponizing information that had been hacked and leaked by Russia with nefarious intent. So I give them credit for actually engaging in that thought process and in acknowledging their own regret about it. But ultimately, every independent news organization is going to have to draw their own conclusions about the best way to deal with situations like this.\nWith regard to the people who are facing these accusations though, they face some decisions too. And what this administration, when faced with a similar circumstance -- our reaction was to try to provide as much information as possible to refute the claims. The incoming administration has relied on secrecy, and I think rather than to refute the claims, it has continued to sow doubt in the minds of the public and apparently in the minds of some media organizations.\nQ: And last question, related to all of this -- fine, the incoming administration may or may not choose to release this information, but my understanding is that Congress has the power to subpoena even the President -- the incoming President to release his tax returns. If I have that right, does the White House feel that that's something that should be done?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm actually not aware of that congressional power. But if it is a power that Congress has, ultimately members of Congress will have to decide for themselves how and whether to exercise it.\nThis gentleman right here.\nQ: Hi. So yesterday, in President Obama's speech, one of the lines I saw frequently quoted was this idea of leaving the Facebook commenting section and going out and talking to people you disagree with. Do you think that --\nMR. EARNEST: He said it a little bit more concisely than you did but -- (laughter) --\nQ: Do you think that the President and this administration has effectively reached out to those who may not have agreed with this administration's agenda, whether that's in the public or on the Hill or elsewhere?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, this administration has gone to great lengths to try to engage the American public. Sometimes it's been through the Internet, but oftentimes that's been in person. President Obama himself has traveled to all 50 states. There were times where we sought out locations where the President could go to communities that had not traditionally supported the President.\nOff the top of my head, I can recall last summer, when President Obama traveled to Elkhart, Indiana -- a community that has enjoyed a dramatic recovery from the Great Recession. Most analysts acknowledge that that recovery was due to the hard work and grit of the people of Elkhart, but that opportunity would not have been available to them without the tough policy decisions that President Obama made early in his presidency.\nAnd yet, despite the benefits that have been enjoyed by that community as a result of the decisions made by President Obama, President Obama didn't fare well in that community during his re-elect. So that's just one example of the President actually seeking out communities that don't agree with him politically to go and try to make his case in person.\nAnd I'll say that I think where the President has acknowledged shortcomings on this score is with regard to the organizing that's done by the Democratic Party. And certainly in the context of the 2016 election, the President has made the argument that Democrats weren't effective in going out and making the case to communities all across the country about how they had benefitted from the policies that Democrats have championed.\nAnd the President believes that in order for Democrats to do better in future elections, we're going to need to do a whole lot more of that.\nQ: One last question. We saw reports that Sasha wasn't there last night because she had an exam today. Any news on how that exam went or what class it was in? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a readout of the youngest Obama's performance in her exam today, but I suspect her parents concluded that her performance on the test would not have been enhanced by returning to the White House at 2:15 in the morning.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. You watched the President-elect's press conference today, you alluded to that --\nMR. EARNEST: I saw most of it.\nQ: What do you make, I'm curious, of the format of the press conference today? A lot different than what we're used to in dealing with President Obama --\nMR. EARNEST: Including a cheering section, apparently.\nQ: -- that we've had over the course of the past eight years. What's your view about how they conducted things today?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think they're going to have an opportunity to set up the structure of these engagements in the way that they believe best serves the President. And that certainly is a prerogative that they have. I don't know if that means they're going to install one of those flashing applause signs in the White House Briefing Room. (Laughter.) But they can do that if they would like.\nLook, what you've heard me say is that it is important for the people who are in positions of authority to be held accountable. And I do think it was important for the President-elect, after a long delay, to make him available to the reporters who were covering him on a daily basis, even an hourly basis, and to answer their questions. And that was important. And I think the American people and our democracy benefits from him doing that.\nQ: As you know, he famously uses Twitter to communicate to the public. What advantages are there, in your view, of just having a regular old press conference and talking to the press corps that covers the President on a daily basis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, that's a very different engagement. When the President-elect is on Twitter he is putting forward into the public views and opinions that go virtually unchallenged. At a news conference it's different. At a news conference, he's responding to a question, he'll give an answer, and in many cases is subjected to a follow-up, somebody pressing a little bit more to more directly answer the question, or to account for something that he's said that may not be consistent with the facts. And that kind of engagement is entirely different than just disseminating information on Twitter.\nQ: So you would suggest more -- not that the Trump campaign or transition is listening to you at this point -- but you would suggest more of these over the course of his presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can just say on principle is that I believe that those kinds of engagements in which people in authority are engaging with the reporters who cover them regularly, that's a good thing for our democracy. There's an important role for those reporters to play in terms of holding people in power accountable. And it's good to see people in authority, in positions of authority spending time answering their questions and being held accountable by them in a way that's public and in a way that everybody can see.\nQ: Any possibility of the Clemson football team coming here to the White House? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: There is a friend of mine who is a proud Clemson graduate who did have an opportunity to fly down to Tampa for the game, who emailed me very early yesterday morning -- presumably as he was boarding his flight back to D.C. -- to find out if that was a possibility. I think it's unlikely that we'll be able to arrange a visit on that short a notice.\nBut obviously, I think Clemson fans have a reason to be real proud of their team, not just in terms of the way that their team performed on the field and beat an Alabama program that I think has -- even with the loss has probably achieved the status of a dynasty, but I also think they can be pretty proud of the way that the coaching staff and the players handled themselves in the aftermath of their victory. And I think that was -- for their heroic performance in the field, during the game, I think it was their humility and sense of camaraderie that they expressed after the game that really struck me.\nSo, John Gizzi, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You said earlier that you would not comment on Rex Tillerson's hearings, that you wouldn't pass judgement and leave that up to the Senate in its capacity to advise and consent, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I'll let the Senate decide. Obviously, it's the men and women of the Senate who have a responsibility to demand answers from the men and women that President-elect Trump has asked to serve in his Cabinet. And ultimately, they will pass judgement on the qualifications of those individuals that have been put forward by the President-elect.\nQ: Now, two good friends and allies of the President, Senator Cory Booker and Congressman John Lewis, are both testifying against Senator Sessions as nominee to be Attorney General. And does what you said about the Tillerson nomination apply to all Cabinet nominations? Do you have a comment on that and on two close allies of the President breaking historical precedent to testify against a nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I would in no way suggest that the standard that I've set for the President or for me who have an institutional responsibility to ensure a smooth and effective transition somehow applies to members of the United States Congress. They should make their voices heard, and they should do so consistent with their own judgement about that.\nAnd I think that's exactly what Congressman Lewis and Senator Booker have done. But President Obama obviously has institutional responsibilities that require him to focus on a transition and not focus on critiquing or criticizing the people that President-elect Trump has appointed to these important positions even if they are not at all the kind of people that President Obama would have appointed.\nQ: And did Senator Booker or Congressman Lewis discuss their intention to testify with the President before they did?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that they spoke to the President about it. But even if they did, I'm not sure that it matters.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:27 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Joe Biden", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121419", "text": "In the summer heat of 1979, amid the deep freeze of the Cold War—I walked into the Kremlin with five of my Senate colleagues.\nWe were there to discuss the strategic arms control agreement known as SALT II—and to gauge whether or not the Soviets were likely to abide by modifications that the Senate had adopted.\nI was 36-years old, in my seventh year as a United States Senator.\nAcross the table sat Alexei Kosygin—the grizzled Soviet Premier—a veteran of World War II and a hard-liner.\nThere was no love between us.\nWe did not trust each other.\nBut neither of our nations wanted to be responsible for unleashing a nuclear apocalypse.\nKosygin did most of the talking that day, and one of the first things he said to me was this reminder:\n\"You are the only nation in the history of mankind that has ever used nuclear weapons. I am not second-guessing that, but you used them.\nSo you have to understand why we think you might use them again.\"\nI came out of that meeting with the assurances I needed, and a lesson that has served me throughout my career—the assumption of good intentions rarely extends to international diplomacy.\nThe Soviets wanted a deal with us not because they trusted us, but because they didn't.\nIt is precisely because we do not trust our adversaries that treaties to constrain the human capacity for destruction are indispensable to the security of the United States of America.\nArms control is integral to our national defense and—when it comes to nuclear weapons—to our self-preservation.\nFrom almost the moment we unlocked the destruction of worlds hidden within the atom, we recognized the equally powerful imperative of preventing the Doomsday Clock from striking midnight.\nAlready in 1953, President Eisenhower—a man synonymous with American military strategy—warned that our security could never be achieved through a nuclear arms race without end:\n\"Let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation. The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb does not permit any such easy solution. Even against the most powerful defense, an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs for a surprise attack could…cause hideous damage.\"\nIn a world possessed of nuclear technology, the effective minimum number of bombs is small.\nEven one can cause hideous damage.\nWith that knowledge—over the course of decades—we negotiated agreements to reduce and control the world's supply of nuclear weapons.\nDespite what some extreme voices argued at the time, the arms control agreements we hammered out with the Soviets were not concessions to an enemy or signs of weakness in the United States.\nThey were a carefully constructed barrier between the American people and total annihilation.\nIt was how we managed a dangerous rivalry, kept it from spinning out of control, and prevented thermonuclear war.\nRepublican and Democratic presidents alike have understood that nothing is more fundamental to our security.\nAnd, for more than four decades, I have been deeply involved with the ins and outs of our strategic agreements.\nAs I said, I was a forceful advocate for SALT II in the '70s and the limits it sought to impose on the growth of the Soviet Union's nuclear capacity.\nIn the '80s, I fought against President Reagan's efforts to weaken the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which threatened the very cornerstone of arms control between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nBut I fought equally hard to make sure his Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces—the first treaty to eliminate a whole class of nuclear arms—would succeed. I traveled across Europe—meeting with Helmut Kohl, Francois Mitterrand, and Margaret Thatcher as well as Soviet leader Gromyko—to bolster support for the treaty.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, I called for the global elimination of tactical nuclear weapons—a position that President George H.W. Bush also worked toward. And I made sure that the START agreement included appropriate measures to monitor nuclear stockpiles in the former Soviet Union.\nToday, the risk of a massive nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States—and the terminal logic of mutually assured destruction—is far less than at the height of the Cold War.\nYet nuclear weapons—the proliferation of this deadly knowledge to more nations, and the possibility of a terrorist obtaining nuclear materials—remain among our most pressing security challenges.\nEven one nuclear bomb can still cause hideous damage.\nThat's why, from the moment President Obama and I took office eight years ago—reducing the threat of a nuclear attack has been a chief national security priority.\nIn Prague in 2009—in his very first foreign policy speech—President Obama passionately argued that the only way the world will be completely safe from nuclear weapons, is to pursue a world without nuclear weapons.\nAnd for the past eight years, that is the vision we have relentlessly pursued.\nThanks to America's leadership, the international community is newly focused on preventing nuclear terrorism. We know that terrorists have both the capacity and the goal of transforming nuclear materials into weapons to sow havoc.\nAnd we know that no nation acting alone can defeat this threat.\nThat's why, in 2010, President Obama gathered leaders from around the globe for the first ever Nuclear Security Summit here in Washington—to create concrete multilateral strategies to lock down loose nuclear materials and prevent nuclear smuggling.\nSince then, the world has met three more times—in Seoul, in The Hague, again last year in DC—to continue building on our progress.\nOur efforts have reduced the supply of nuclear weapons-usable material in the world. And we've not only stepped up the physical protection of facilities where nuclear materials are stored—we've greatly improved our ability to detect and seize unregulated nuclear and radiological materials being smuggled in secret.\nActing together with our international partners, we've strengthened the global nuclear security architecture that monitors and enforces nuclear norms:\nRatifying and bringing into force important international treaties to secure nuclear materials and prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists.\nProviding better funding and resources for the International Atomic Energy Agency. Expanding the Proliferation Security Initiative.\nThese steps have bolstered the international norms and institutions around the protection of nuclear materials.\nAnd with the creation of the Nuclear Security Contact group, the world can continue to build on this momentum to deliver progress for many years to come.\nFor eight years, the United States has also led in strengthening the non-proliferation regime, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty—that basic agreement that: countries with nuclear weapons will pursue good faith negotiations on disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not seek to gain them, and all countries can access and benefit from peaceful nuclear energy.\nWe built a global consensus that nuclear norms must be upheld, international commitments must be honored, and those who violate these standards must be called to account.\nThat's why the United States made it an international priority to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nDecades of animosity and chest thumping did not cut off Iran's burgeoning nuclear program. We did—through international economic pressure combined with hard-nosed diplomacy.\nAs with the Soviet Union during the Cold War—we negotiated with Iran precisely because we did not, and do not, trust them.\nThat's why we sought an internationally verifiable agreement to constrain their nuclear activities. One that cut off every single path that could lead to a nuclear weapon—and one that instituted the most rigorous inspections regime in history to ensure they hold up their end of the deal.\nIf full implementation continues, the deal will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon—and remove the threat of Iran using nuclear weapons against us or our allies. And we accomplished this without inciting another devastating war in the Middle East.\nWhen we came to office, Iran was inching closer to a nuclear weapons capability—but North Korea had already crossed the threshold.\nAnd as North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities continue to expand, it poses a growing threat to international security and our own national defense.\nThat's why we've been so vigilant in keeping the international community united to raise the costs on North Korea for its flagrant violations of nuclear norms.\nJust last year, in response to two illegal nuclear tests by North Korea, the United Nations Security Council—including China and Russia—unanimously adopted two resolutions imposing the most far-reaching and comprehensive sanctions on North Korea to date.\nWe need to ensure that these sanctions are enforced by all—to ensure North Korea understands that we will continue to impose costs for their illegal behavior.\nAs with Iran, the goal of sanctions is not to punish the people of North Korea, but to induce their leadership to negotiate in earnest.\nNorth Korea's growing capability is one of the most significant challenges the next administration will face. There are no simple solutions.\nBut any viable path forward must include standing with our Asian allies to send a clear message to Pyongyang: Attempts at coercion or intimidation will fail. Security and international respect cannot be attained through illegal weapons. And as long as that is the choice North Korea's leaders continue to make, their country will remain economically isolated and an international pariah.\nWe must continue working closely with the international community—including China—to convince North Korea to reverse course.\nAs we've worked to stem the spread of nuclear weapons, we've also advanced the second half of the non-proliferation bargain: that every nation can use peaceful nuclear technology—for energy, for medical advancements, for research to better the human condition.\nAgain, this understanding dates back to President Eisenhower, who said: \"It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.\"\nWe've invested significant time and energy buttressing the international framework for civil nuclear cooperation. We've taken practical steps like supporting the IAEA's Low-Enriched Uranium bank and setting up our own American fuel bank so that states are ensured reliable access to nuclear energy without setting up fuel-cycle capabilities in their own countries.\nTen years ago, I ushered our civil-nuclear cooperation agreement with India through the Senate—an agreement that will allow U.S. nuclear reactors to provide enough electricity to power New Delhi and Mumbai through peak usage in the hottest summer day.\nAnd over the past eight years, our administration has pursued and brought into force new peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia, China, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam and others.\nIn total, the United States now has 22 such agreements with 47 partners resulting in the production of more than 1.5 million gigawatt hours of safe, clean nuclear power worldwide in 2015—enough to power 150 million homes for an entire year.\nOf course, no discussion of nuclear weapons can ignore the fact that the United States possesses one of the two largest arsenals of nuclear weapons in the world.\nA nuclear deterrent has been the bedrock of our national defense since World War II. And so long as other countries possess nuclear weapons that could be used against us, we too must maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal to deter attacks against ourselves and our allies.\nThat is why, early in the administration, we increased funding to maintain our arsenal and modernize our nuclear infrastructure—so that our arsenal remains safe and reliable—even with fewer weapons, and even without tests.\nThis investment was not only consistent with our nonproliferation goals—it was essential to them. Guaranteeing the capabilities of our stockpile allowed us to continue to pursue nuclear reductions without compromising our security.\nAnd as part of President Obama's charge to reduce reliance on \"launch under attack\" procedures in U.S. planning, the Department of Defense has adjusted our planning and processes to give the president more flexibility in deciding how to respond to a range of nuclear scenarios.\nIn our 2010 Nuclear Posture Review—we made a commitment to create the conditions by which the sole purpose of nuclear weapons would be to deter others from launching a nuclear attack.\nAccordingly, over the course of our Administration, we have steadily reduced the primacy nuclear weapons have held in our national security policies since World War II—while improving our ability to deter and defeat any adversaries—and reassure our Allies—without reliance on nuclear weapons.\nGiven our non-nuclear capabilities and the nature of today's threats—it's hard to envision a plausible scenario in which the first use of nuclear weapons by the United States would be necessary. Or make sense.\nPresident Obama and I are confident we can deter—and defend ourselves and our Allies against—non-nuclear threats through other means.\nThe next administration will put forward its own policies.\nBut, seven years after the Nuclear Posture Review charge—the President and I strongly believe we have made enough progress that deterring—and if necessary, retaliating against—a nuclear attack should be the sole purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.\nIf we want a world without nuclear weapons—the United States must take the initiative to lead us there. Moreover—as President Obama poignantly highlighted during his visit to Hiroshima—as the only nation to have used nuclear weapons, we bear a great moral responsibility to lead the charge.\nThat's why we negotiated with Russia the most ambitious arms reduction treaty in two decades—New START.\nI fought hard for this treaty—as I have for every substantive arms control agreement since the 1970s—because it makes Americans safer.\nIt's not about trust or goodwill.\nIt's about strategic stability and greater transparency between the world's two great nuclear powers—a fact that has become more critical as our relationship with Russia has grown increasingly strained.\nNew START enshrines rigorous verification and monitoring mechanisms for nuclear reductions. And, next year—when the central limits of the treaty come into effect the strategic nuclear arsenals of our two countries will be at their lowest level in six decades.\nThat is a major step forward. But I confess, it is not as much progress as our administration hoped to make.\nFor the past three years, Russia has refused to negotiate additional reductions of deployed and non-deployed arsenals.\nBut American leadership on this issue need not wait for Russia.\nSince 2009, the United States has dismantled 2,226 nuclear warheads.\nAnd I'm proud to share some news.\nAfter determining that we can safely reduce our nuclear stockpile even further—over the past year, President Obama set aside almost 500 warheads for dismantlement on top of those previously scheduled for retirement last year.\nThat puts our active nuclear stockpile at 4,018 warheads in service and approximately 2,800 in line to be destroyed. And we have recommended that the next administration conduct a comprehensive nuclear posture review to determine whether additional reductions may be undertaken.\nAs I have long said—the United States is strongest when we lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\nOur efforts have not only reduced the threat that nuclear weapons pose to our future, they have positioned our successors to continue making progress toward the day when we can finally and forever rid our world of this scourge.\nBut I am not here to only laud our successes.\nWe did not accomplish all that we hoped.\nWe lobbied hard for the U.S. to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.\nThe United States has not conducted a nuclear test for more than two decades. The directors of our nuclear laboratories tell us that we know more about our arsenal today—and its reliability—through Stockpile Stewardship than they did when testing was commonplace. And ratifying the treaty would be an incredible boon to strengthen the existing global norm against nuclear testing—yet we were blocked at every turn in the Senate.\nI did not always support the decisions made by President Reagan or either of the Presidents Bush—but during my 36 years as a Senator, I repeatedly helped improve and pass arms-control measures pursued by Republican presidents for one simple reason: nuclear security is too important for party politics—for our nation and the world.\nAnd although we no longer live with the daily dread of nuclear confrontation, the dangers we face today also require a bipartisan spirit.\nThe challenges looming on the horizon will require leadership not only from the next President and Vice President, but from Congress as well.\nWhile the vast majority of the international community understands that the world is more dangerous when more nations and people wield nuclear weapons, there are still those who seek to grow their arsenals and develop new types of nuclear weapons.\nNot just North Korea, but Russia, Pakistan, and others have made counterproductive moves that only increase the risk that nuclear weapons could be used in a regional conflict in Europe, South Asia, or East Asia.\nWorking with Congress, the next administration will have to navigate these dangers and—I hope—continue leading the global consensus to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our world.\nIn particular, they will have to determine how best to improve strategic stability with Russia—which has eroded over the past few years.\nWhile we have shifted our security doctrine away from our nuclear arsenal, they have moved to rely more heavily on theirs.\nSome of that has to do with Russia's concerns about the technological advances and superior conventional capacity of the United States military.\nBut it is a shift in strategy that increases the nuclear danger to our world.\nFurthermore, Russia is currently in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which has been in effect for almost 30 years.\nAnd they have thus far refused to engage constructively with the United States on returning to compliance or to broach discussions about strategic stability and future arms reductions.\nAs the next administration navigates these difficult security tasks—they will have to make decisions for America's security that recognize budgetary constraints and require tradeoffs.\nIf future budgets reverse the choices we have made—and pour additional money into a nuclear buildup that hearkens back to the Cold War—it will do nothing to increase the day-to-day security of the United States and our allies.\nAnd it will mean we will have fewer resources to devote to areas that are indispensable to our 21st century security needs—areas like cybersecurity, space, and the health and modernization of our conventional force.\nIt risks placing the theoretical power of a weapon we hope-to-God never to use again above the tools our military uses each and every day.\nIt risks increasing the chances of a nuclear conflict through miscalculation—and destroying the confidence-building measures and security agreements that have protected the American people for decades.\nAnd it risks degrading America's moral leadership in the world—diminishing our standing with our allies and compromising our capacity to achieve any of our other goals with the international community.\nI know that as we move forward in this debate—there will be voices who counsel a nuclear arms race in the name of realism.\nI know, because they have always been there.\nAnd their arguments make even less sense now—in a world where the most challenging nuclear threat comes not from foreign governments with advanced technology—but from the terrorist with a crude Cold War relic in a suitcase, heading for any major city in the world.\nIn that first speech in Prague eight years ago, President Obama distilled the essence of the problem when he said: \"Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked – that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction. Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.\"\nOver the past eight years, we have sought to defeat fatalism.\nWe have rejected inevitabilities.\nAs a nation, I believe we must keep pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons—because that is the only surety we have against the nightmare scenario becoming reality.\nThis was a problem created by human ingenuity.\nSo it can be solved with human ingenuity and a belief in our better angels. Our capacity for destruction must always be balanced by the weight of shared responsibility.\nThat's a belief I have held for more than 40 years.\nIt's one I have fought to make real time and again.\nAnd one I have been honored to keep advancing for the American people alongside President Obama for the past eight years.\nMay God continue to bless the United States of America.\nAnd God protect our troops.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on Nuclear Security"}

As a case in point, consider Mr. Justice Hugo Black, who was at one time a U.S. Senator from Alabama who was subsequently appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice Black became one of the greatest advocates for human and civil rights that has ever sat on the high court. We need such a person to serve as Attorney General of the United States of America. What would be more noteworthy for the State of Alabama than having an Alabamian follow in the footsteps of the late Mr. Justice Hugo Black?

The fact that I did not rise on my own to defend Jeff's good name and character haunted me for years. I promised Jeff that I would never stand idly by and allow another good and decent person endure a similar character assassination if it was within my power to stop it.\" (Stephen Dinan And S.A. Miller, \"Amid Racism Accusations, Sessions Has Powerful Character Witness,\" The Washington Times, 11/18/16)\nA Career Of Honor And Respect For Americans Of Color\nSenator Sessions voted in favor of the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act.\nSenator Sessions was one of the only 17 Republican senators to vote to confirm President's Obama's Attorney General, Eric Holder.\nSenator Sessions spearheaded the effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, an Alabama native and Civil Rights icon.\nWorking with Cory Booker, Senator Sessions led the Senate effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Foot Soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama.\nSenator Sessions publicly supported ongoing efforts to commemorate within the National Park Service the heroic actions of the 1961 Freedom Riders in Anniston and Calhoun County, Alabama.\nA History Of Civil Rights Enforcement\nKu Klux Klan Murderer Henry Hays—In 1981, Sessions worked with DOJ attorneys, the FBI, county investigators, and the county district attorney to solve the murder of nineteen year-old African American Michael Donald. Sessions' U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted \"Tiger\" Knowles as an accomplice, obtaining a guilty plea and life sentence in federal court. After hard investigative work, Sessions shifted the case of KKK murderer Henry Hays to state court where he received the death penalty, which was not then available at the federal level.\nUSA v. Benny Jack Hayes—Sessions' office successfully prosecuted Alabama Ku Klux Klan \"Great Titan\" Bennie Jack Hays, who ordered his son, Henry Hays, to kill an African American, for attempting to defraud his home insurer in order to collect money to pay for his son's legal defense.\nConecuh County—In 1983, Sessions joined in bringing the first lawsuit in the history of the Department of Justice to stop the suppression of African American voting rights. In United States v. Conecuh County, the DOJ Civil Rights Division, along with Sessions, sued white Conecuh County election officials, including the Chair of the local Republican Party. The county settled the lawsuit through a consent decree that ensured election officials would not engage in racial discriminatory conduct designed to harass or intimidate voters, nor discriminate in the selection of election officials at polling places.\nMarengo County—After the District Court found that the at large system for electing members to the county commission and local board of education diluted the voting rights of African Americans in violation of the Voting Rights Act, Sessions assisted the DOJ Civil Rights Division in working with private plaintiffs to craft a districting plan to ensure that African Americans had equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. At the time of the suit, no African American had ever been elected to the commission or the board. DOJ, working with Sessions' office, secured a districting plan that resulted in 3 of the 5 members of both the County Commission and the board of education elected from districts in which the majority of voters were African American. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the plan, and the district court awarded attorney's fees, stating the United States \"was indispensable to the plaintiff's success.\" 667 F. Supp. 786, 799 (S.D. Alabama 1987).\nDallas County—In 1978, the Department of Justice sued Dallas County, Alabama, to replace its at-large election system with a district system. Under the new district system, African Americans had a much better chance of electing the candidates of their choice. Supported by the ACLU, Sessions supported DOJ's Civil Rights Division's extensive litigation and appeals culminating in a 1988 decision from the 11th Circuit Court that created five single member districts for both the County Commission and the Board of Education. Three of these districts contained a majority-African American voter population, increasing the opportunity for African American voters to elect the officeholders of their choice. 636 F.Supp. 704, May 16, 1986; 791 F.2d 831, (11th Cir., May 23, 1986); 661 F.Supp. 955, May 21, 1987; 671 F.Supp. 1337 (11th Cir., Oct. 23, 1987); 850 F.2d 1430 (11th Cir., July 13, 1988); 850 F.2d 1433 (11th Cir., July 13, 1988). Though not required to do so, as U.S. Attorney, Sessions chose to join the filings with the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\nMobile County—After nearly a decade of litigation, a group of students, their parents and the Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, Alabama, entered into a consent decree that integrated many schools in the county but also left untouched many single-race schools. More than a decade after the district court approved the consent decree, DOJ and Sessions—with the support of the NAACP—challenged the decree because it did not fully integrate all the public schools in the county. The District Court modified the consent decree, agreeing with DOJ and Sessions that the school district was not yet fully integrated. See Davis v. Board of Sch. Comm'rs of Mobile Cnty., 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27519, at *2–3 (S.D. Ala., Mar. 27, 1986). In addition to joining the legal arguments made by the DOJ Civil Rights Division in the case and serving as DOJ's local face in the Southern District of Alabama, where the suit was prosecuted, Sessions also sent his children to attend the integrated public schools in Mobile.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Press Release - U.S. Sen.

This is exactly the type of experience and leadership our country needs to grow the economy for all Americans.\nMnuchin understands the importance of free markets and access to capital. From Main Street businesses to the Fortune 500 companies, he understands the impact of excess regulation and knows how to grow wages.\nAs a regional banker, Mnuchin loaned money to individuals, families, farmers and small businesses. At Goldman Sachs he managed 5,000 employees and a $1 billion annual technology budget.\nHe knows how to help hardworking Americans achieve success, how to make our country competitive and how to engage technology and people. Importantly, he understands how currency impacts trade, and he will represent America on the global stage.\nAs Treasury secretary, Mnuchin will restore robust economic growth through lower taxes, higher wages and less burdensome government regulation. At the top of his policy agenda is reforming our complex, cumbersome and counterproductive tax code for everyone.\nHe proposes reducing business taxes to bring the tax burden on U.S. businesses more in line with that of our global competitors, and creating a tax system that favors companies that produce goods and services in the U.S., thereby creating jobs here.\nThis system will benefit the American student, the American family, the American worker, the American employer and the American entrepreneur by valuing their efforts and equalizing the tax burden to make us more competitive and, quite frankly, more successful.\nMnuchin also wants to put more money in people's pockets by simplifying and reducing taxes on individuals, particularly the middle class. In addition, he will bring back more than $2.6 trillion in revenue that American companies have earned in foreign markets, now stranded by tax policies enacted in the 1960s.\nMnuchin understands why the U.S. economy hasn't performed up to its full potential. He has a clear plan to fix it, which is why he needs to be confirmed quickly so he can hit the ground running as close to Jan. 20 as possible.\nMnuchin and President-elect Trump will disrupt the status quo and promote higher growth and better wages. That's exactly what we need right now.\nSafra Catz is chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Press Release - Oracle CEO Safra Catz: Steven Mnuchin Will Get America Growing Again"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123060", "text": "\"So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly —- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 'Yes, we can.'\"\n-- President Barack Obama, Prague, Czech Republic, April 5, 2009\nPresident Obama's historic speech in Prague in 2009 outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons and outlined work for achieving this goal in four pillars: (1) preventing nuclear terrorism and promoting nuclear security; (2) strengthening the non-proliferation regime; (3) supporting the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and (4) reducing the role of nuclear weapons. This administration has worked diligently since 2009 to develop enduring institutions and strengthen existing frameworks that will continue, under their own momentum, to produce a safer world when it comes to the threat of nuclear weapons.\nPrevent Nuclear Terrorism and Promote Nuclear Security\nFour successful Nuclear Security Summits have convened more than 50 world leaders to take tangible and lasting steps to prevent terrorists from gaining nuclear weapons. For example, we have made significant improvements across the globe in the security and elimination of fissile material. This includes the removal of highly enriched uranium and plutonium from more than 50 facilities in 30 countries — more than four metric tons of nuclear material, which is enough material for more than 160 nuclear weapons. Since 2009, 16 nations and Taiwan — countries from Argentina and Libya to Serbia and Vietnam — have eliminated their holdings of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, making Latin America, Central Europe, and Southeast Asia completely free of these dangerous materials. We also have buttressed International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) capabilities and provided technical and legal support to partner nations to bolster international efforts to secure nuclear material and put an end to nuclear smuggling. Furthermore, we have developed stronger partnerships with dozens of countries and international organizations that improve our collective ability to detect, deter, and respond to nuclear and radiological threats that fundamentally make us all safer. In total, Summit participants made 350 new commitments to improve the security of nuclear materials worldwide.\nThe Nuclear Security Summits also served to strengthen the global nuclear security architecture. In particular, the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (the Amendment) — which entered into force due to the Administration's efforts to secure 16 additional ratifications — makes clear the international community's responsibility to secure nuclear materials. The Amendment, ratified by the United States in 2015, fills a gap in the existing international regime by modernizing the international legal framework for nuclear security, which is essential to our efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction or sabotaging nuclear facilities. Now that it has entered into force, the amendment becomes legally binding and will be taken into account in the IAEA's regular review conferences on the implementation of the treaty. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism also plays a key role in the global architecture and we encourage the United Nations to hold a high-level meeting under this treaty in 2017. In addition, the Nuclear Security Contact Group also provides a mechanism that will continue to identify opportunities to further strengthen nuclear security.\nThe Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), which was initiated under the Administration of President George W. Bush, has grown to more than 100 nations, and has significantly improved our collective ability to prevent and interdict weapon of mass destruction-related shipments. In addition, we have worked with 36 partner countries to install radiation detection equipment at more than 360 international border crossings, airports, and ports to dramatically increase and improve mobile detection systems.\nIn 2015, President Obama signed and ratified two Protocols to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA). The SUA Protocols established the first international treaty framework for criminalizing certain terrorist acts, including using a ship or fixed platform in a terrorist activity, transporting weapons of mass destruction or their delivery systems and related materials, and transporting terrorist fugitives. U.S. ratification of these treaties honors U.S. pledges made at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit and at the PSI 10th Anniversary Meeting in 2013.\nStrengthen the Non-Proliferation Regime\nPresident Obama's Prague speech reinforced the necessity for international resolve to enforce nonproliferation rules, to strengthen existing elements of the nonproliferation regime, and to put in place new tools and instruments in order to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons. At the center of this effort is the President's commitment to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty's (NPT's) three pillars — Disarmament, Nonproliferation, and the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.\nWe have strengthened the global nonproliferation regime by continuing to unite the international community against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and strongly respond to rule breakers. This is perhaps most notable with respect to Iran but also, as U.N. Security Council resolutions (UNSCR) 2270 and 2321 demonstrate, in relation to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\nWhen President Obama took office, the United States was also confronted by Iran's burgeoning nuclear program. After two years of strong diplomacy, the United States, together with our international partners, achieved something that decades of animosity had not - a comprehensive, long-term deal with Iran that, if it continues to be fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran has removed two-thirds of its centrifuges, reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent, and filled the core of its heavy water reactor at Arak with concrete so it can never be used again. Iran also agreed to the most comprehensive and intrusive verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. Finally, the restriction at the center of the deal—that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon—is permanent.\nThe United States has worked with the international community to send a clear message that we will not tolerate North Korea's illicit nuclear and ballistic missile activities and will continue to impose costs on North Korea until it comes into compliance with its international obligations. We continued to prioritize the denuclearization of North Korea and have pursued a comprehensive, sustained pressure campaign — of which UN Security Council resolutions and sanctions have been a key part. In targeting the Kim regime's reputation and sources of revenue, we continued to steadily tighten sanctions and increase pressure in an effort to compel the regime to return to credible negotiations.\nThe United States has maintained its longstanding support both for the IAEA's nonproliferation verification activities as well as its valuable role in enhancing nuclear transparency. The United States provides approximately 25 percent of the IAEA's regular budget and, in addition, provides additional financial contributions in support of the IAEA's safeguards, security, and safety missions, as well as to support IAEA technical cooperation projects.\nU.S. assistance also includes considerable in-kind assistance to the IAEA, including technical assistance from our National Laboratories. U.S. in-kind contributions include the provision of technology and equipment, subject matter experts, IAEA inspector training, and support to IAEA-hosted training courses for Member State representatives in safety, security, and safeguards. Together, these U.S. contributions help ensure that the IAEA has the tools, training, and resources it needs to carry out its responsibilities to safeguard nuclear materials and facilities worldwide to detect and deter nuclear proliferation.\nFurthermore, to demonstrate our commitment to increased stockpile transparency, the United States recently committed to the disposition under IAEA monitoring of an additional six metric tons of surplus plutonium that is excess to defense needs, in addition to the 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium subject to disposition under the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement.\nSupport Peaceful Energy Use\nThis administration has taken significant steps in support of a new international framework for civil nuclear cooperation, so countries can have access to peaceful nuclear energy in a manner that is consistent with the highest nonproliferation standards. Working with our IAEA partners, the United States has provided significant support to the IAEA Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Fuel Bank to help ensure that States in compliance with their nonproliferation requirements will have an assured supply of nuclear fuel. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) developed a U.S. fuel bank, containing down-blended material from nuclear weapons, to underscore further the reliability of supply. Through these measures, the administration has worked to ensure that States will have continued access to LEU fuel for civil reactors while, at the same time, eliminating incentives for countries to invest in the development of costly indigenous and proliferation-sensitive fuel cycle capabilities.\nWe also have brought into force new peaceful cooperation agreements with Russia, China, the Republic of Korea, the IAEA, Taiwan, and Vietnam. These agreements are important tools in advancing U.S. nonproliferation principles, in addition to promoting the production of peaceful nuclear energy. These agreements act in conjunction with other nonproliferation tools, and in order for a country to enter into such an agreement with the United States, that country must commit itself to adhering to certain U.S.-mandated nuclear nonproliferation norms. In total, the United States now has 22 such agreements with 47 partners resulting in the production of more than 1.5 million gigawatt hours of safe, clean nuclear power worldwide in 2015—enough to power 150 million homes for an entire year.\nThese agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation set the stage for U.S. companies to compete in the global civil nuclear energy market, which the Department of Commerce estimates to be $500-$740 billion over the next ten years. The U.S. civil nuclear industry remains the largest part of the American clean energy portfolio, and constitutes a powerful tool in bringing the world low-carbon electricity.\nReduce the Role of Nuclear Weapons\nReducing the number and role of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy, while maintaining a nuclear arsenal that is safe, secure, and effective for as long as nuclear weapons exist, is a key driver toward a world without nuclear weapons. Through the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review and subsequent implementation, the Department of Defense (DOD) made adjustments to nuclear plans and command and control processes to maximize Presidential decision flexibility and timelines in a crisis. DOD and DOE are working diligently to modernize our nuclear arsenal and develop a responsive nuclear infrastructure to support further reductions in the number of deployed and non-deployed weapons. But they are doing so without introducing new nuclear weapons for new missions into the U.S. arsenal, without relying on nuclear explosive testing for stockpile maintenance, and without maintaining a significant nuclear stockpile or \"hedge” once modernization is complete.\nIn 2010, the United States and Russia signed the  New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START Treaty). This Treaty is critical to managing the possibility of a future nuclear arms competition between Russia and the United States and maintaining stability during a time of increased tensions. The New START Treaty established rigorous verification and monitoring mechanisms for nuclear reductions, reinforcing stability in U.S. and Russian nuclear behavior. Once the central limits go into effect in February 2018, the U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals will be at their lowest levels in six decades. The United States and Russia are both on track to meet the central limits by the Treaty's deadline. As of January 2017, the United States has 681 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and deployed heavy bombers; 1,367 warheads on deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and counted for deployed heavy bombers; and 848 deployed and non-deployed launchers of ICBMs, deployed and non-deployed launchers of SLBMs, and deployed and non-deployed heavy bombers.\nAlthough the Obama Administration was unable to reach its goal of gaining Senate advice and consent to ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), significant steps were taken to reinforce the global norm against nuclear explosive testing and bolster the Preparatory Commission for the CTBT Organization. The United States was a leading voice in support of the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2310, calling for the ratification and entry into force of the CTBT and reaffirming the global moratorium against nuclear testing. In addition, to support the U.S. ratification of the CTBT, DOE has invested heavily in the Stockpile Stewardship Program to ensured that the stockpile can be certified safe, secure, and reliable without nuclear explosive testing, thus removing both of the major impediments to CTBT ratification — concerns regarding lack of verification and lack of confidence in the effectiveness of our stockpile.\nTo demonstrate the continued U.S. commitment to reducing the number of nuclear weapons in our arsenal, President Obama has unilaterally reduced the U.S. nuclear stockpile by approximately 500 warheads this year and added these weapons to the dismantlement queue. Additionally, DOE requested funding to accelerate warhead dismantlement by 20 percent. However, Congress has refused to provide this funding in both fiscal year 2016 and 2017. To enable further reductions to the U.S. nuclear stockpile, DOE initiated life extension programs (LEP) that enable long term reductions in the types of warheads and overall stockpile size; for instance, the B61-12 LEP, will consolidate the number and types of nuclear bombs and allow us to retire the last megaton class nuclear weapon.\nIncreasing the transparency of global nuclear stockpiles is important to nonproliferation efforts, including the implementation of obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the pursuit of further reductions that cover all nuclear weapons: deployed and non-deployed, strategic and non-strategic. As of September 2016, the U.S. active stockpile of nuclear warheads consisted of 4,018 warheads. This number represents an 87 percent reduction in the stockpile from its maximum (31,255) at the end of fiscal year 1967, and an 82 percent reduction from its level (22,217) when the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989. From fiscal years 1994 through 2016, the United States dismantled 10,681 nuclear warheads. Since September 30, 2013, the United States has dismantled 666 nuclear warheads. With the additional retirement of approximately 500 nuclear warheads in 2016, approximately 2,800 additional nuclear warheads are currently retired and awaiting dismantlement. Additionally, the number of U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons has declined by more than 90 percent since September 30, 1991. From fiscal year 2009 through the end of fiscal year 2016, the U.S. dismantled 2,226 warheads and retired an additional 1,255 weapons.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Fact Sheet: The Prague Nuclear Agenda"}

This is the first time the United States is sanctioning specific Syrian officials in connection with Syria's violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 2118.\nWe condemn in the strongest possible terms the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons.

Syria agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention after its horrifying sarin chemical attack on Syrian civilians in the Ghouta area of Damascus on August 21, 2013, which killed more than a thousand people, many of them children. The United States worked closely with partners after that attack to remove and destroy the Syrian government's declared chemical weapons program – an unprecedented operation to eliminate a dangerous threat to innocent civilians in Syria and the international community.\nThe United States remains committed to working with our international partners to use all appropriate diplomatic mechanisms to hold the Syrian regime accountable for its abhorrent use of chemical weapons.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121380", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:37 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. Before we get started, I did want to call to your attention an announcement that was made briefly by the U.S. government earlier this morning.\nThe United States, this morning, at the WTO, the World Trade Organization, announced that we had filed a case against China for artificially cheap loans from banks and low-priced inputs for Chinese aluminum. The case that we have made is that those cheap loans and low-priced inputs are contributing to excess global capacity and undercutting American workers and businesses.\nToday's action follows numerous bilateral efforts by the Obama administration to persuade China to take strong steps to address the excess capacity situation in its aluminum sector. Those of you who have been following along know that this is the 16th trade enforcement challenge the Obama administration has launched against China at the WTO. It's a demonstration of our commitment to hold China to its trade obligations.\nAnd, of course, the incoming administration has spoken forcefully about their commitment to standing up for the United States when it comes to global trade. The incoming administration has suggested that they would consider imposing high tariffs and building walls in ways that economists have said would be damaging to workers, U.S. workers, bad for U.S. businesses, bad for U.S. entrepreneurs, bad for the broader American economy, and bad for American college graduates that are entering the workforce.\nThe Obama administration has taken a different approach. And as I have on a number of a policies, I would invite you to, as you consider the policies that are put forward by the incoming administration, evaluate their performance based on the approach that President Obama has pursued. And I will spare you the long recitation of the dramatic improvement we've seen in our economy, because that certainly is the backdrop for all of this.\nBut when it comes specifically to trade enforcement, you should remember that the United States, during the Obama administration over the last eight years, has filed more cases at the WTO than any other country. Now, in some ways that makes sense because the U.S. economy is so large and benefits from our strong relationships with other countries overseas, but it's an illustration of how aggressively the Obama administration has worked to protect our economy here in the United States in the context of our trade relationships. Twenty-five cases filed at the WTO against other countries, by the United States, under President Obama's leadership.\nOf those cases, the United States has won every single one that's been decided. Fourteen of the twenty-five cases have been decided. We're 14 and 0 in those cases. There are six others that have been settled in our favor. That, of course, means that there are five that are still pending, including the one that was announced today.\nOf the 25 that we have filed at the WTO, 16 of them have been filed against China -- more than any other country over the last eight years. And as you would expect -- those of you who are good at math will predict this -- of the cases that have been decided, that we filed against China, we won them all -- seven -- we're 7 and 0 -- and that included cases that we won at the WTO to protect the American economy related to China policies that impact American-grown agricultural goods, American poultry, American-made manufacturing goods, including high-tech steel, cars and SUVs, airplanes, textiles, and medical products.\nSo, at some point next year, you will hear a robust case from the incoming administration about their proposal to ensure that America and our economy is protected when it comes to global trade. They'll have a very high standard to meet when you consider the success of the Obama administration, not just in terms of bringing these cases to the WTO, but also when you consider the performance of our broader economy.\nSo with that, we'll go to your questions. Vivian, it's nice to see you. Welcome to the briefing room.\nQ: Hi, thanks. I moved in a little early.\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) Good. Why don't you get us started today?\nQ: Sure. So the transition team has been really touting the fact that they have not had a very easygoing -- with the hearings -- that the Obama administration, they say, kind of had smooth sailing through their nominees, that their nominees had smooth sailing throughout their whole process. And so I just wanted to kind of hear your thoughts on that. Is there sort of a partisan push against their hearings? Do you feel that their nominees have in any way kind of had it a little bit more difficult than President Obama's nominees when they first were coming in?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a lot of explanations that people can consider for this broader phenomenon. Certainly when you consider the way that Republicans in the Senate treated Obama nominees, the claim is laughable.\nThe President of the United States put forward the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history. Merrick Garland had more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee since the dawn of our Republic. He was recognized by Republicans as somebody who would be a consensus choice. He was somebody that had a sterling legal career and somebody who served this country as a law enforcement official, including leading the investigation and prosecution of one of the worst terrorists in American history. Republicans did not raise any sort of objection about his credentials, but they refused to even consider this nomination because he was appointed by a Democratic President. It's outrageous. Outrageous.\nI noted yesterday -- maybe it was the day before -- the disparate treatment, shall we say, afforded by Chairman Chuck Grassley of the Judiciary Committee in terms of the way that President Obama's nominee to be Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, was handled, and the way that President Trump's nominee, Jeff Sessions, has been handled, despite having what I think just about everybody acknowledges is some controversy in his past.\nSo I think this is a very difficult case for the incoming administration to make. But if they want to make it, they can.\nRoberta.\nQ: You talked about the trade enforcement. I wanted to ask you about an environmental enforcement issue. The EPA today said it's accusing Fiat Chrysler of excess diesel emissions, something that could come with a maximum fine of about $4.6 billion. And the CEO today called this \"absolute nonsense,\" in his words, and said the EPA was \"grandstanding,\" said that the matter could have been settled or handled without such a public announcement. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about whether the White House signed off on what the EPA did today, why the EPA decided to make this announcement today, the importance of it.\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that enforcement decisions at the EPA are made by officials at the EPA, and I'm not aware of any White House involvement in this particular matter. The President's expectation is that officials at the EPA will fulfill their duty to enforce the laws and enforce regulations that are on the books, but how exactly they do that is up to enforcement officials at the EPA.\nSo for how this particular case was handled, I'd refer you to the EPA, but the President certainly does retain confidence in the important work that's done by the EPA and retains confidence in their ability to effectively enforce the law.\nQ: And the CEO said that the company plans to work with the incoming administration to put the matter behind them. Do you think that it would appropriate for the incoming administration to deal with this kind of enforcement issue directly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with regard to how the incoming administration chooses to handle this matter, I'll obviously defer to them. But the respect that we have shown the enforcement process by ensuring that politics does not infect it is a tradition and precedent that we believe is worth upholding, and it's one that we have rigorously upheld over the course of the last eight years and hopefully that will persist into the next administration.\nQ: And lastly, did the President ask Director Clapper to call President-elect Trump last night?\nMR. EARNEST: He did not. He did not. I saw the statement from Director Clapper, but that call was not placed at the urging of the White House. I can't speak to what may have led to the phone call that occurred between the Director of National Intelligence and the President-elect last night. You should check with Director Clapper's office.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Have you talked to the President about the Donald Trump press conference yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not spoken to the President about the news conference yesterday. As I have mentioned, I am sure that he has followed the extensive news coverage, but I'm not aware that he watched it in real time and I have not had a chance to talk to him about it.\nQ: Okay. And looking at an exchange like that, towards the start of the presser and the way the President-elect handled questions that were shouted out, what are your thoughts on that and how it bodes for moving forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the best way for me to answer that question is to talk about my own experience having worked in the White House Press Office for the last eight years.\nAs all of you know -- except maybe you, Vivian, but maybe everyone else knows and maybe you've heard -- there are ample occasions where I and some of my White House colleagues have not agreed with the way that certain journalists have chosen to ask questions of the President. Sometimes we've been frustrated by the number of questions that are asked in one exchange. Sometimes we've been frustrated that questions include either questionable or inaccurate premises. In some cases, we've been frustrated that the line of questioning from a number of journalists has been focused on the same thing. There are other occasions where I've expressed to journalists some frustration with their decision to interrupt the President as he's giving his answer to try to press him more forcefully. And there have even been occasions where the President himself has betrayed a little frustration about that.\nBut I think, even at those moments where our frustration has been most acute, I can never recall a scenario in which I was tempted to throw somebody out of the room.\nQ: Never?\nMR. EARNEST: Um. (Laughter.) I can certainly say that that's nothing that I ever threatened to do, even if the thought did cross my mind.\nBut, look, this is part of the process. This is what it means to engage with the press corps. And I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the case that many of the speakers -- because there was more than just one yesterday -- hard-pressed to make the case that they didn't invite a little conflict and friction. There were some pretty tough, even outrageous claims that were made. So it's not hard to see how that kind of environment is shaped by the people who organized the event.\nBut ultimately, this exchange of ideas is good for the country. This questioning of people in authority by independent journalists is important to our democracy. That's what we need to -- that's what ensures the health of our democracy.\nAnd so it's important that -- I guess my point is I want to make sure that I don't say something in this context, even as I cite my own experience, that would dissuade the incoming administration from participating in this process. It's good for the country. And the President-elect himself indicated that he thought it was good for him -- at least it was in the context of the primaries. So I hope that, recognizing that he felt like it was in his interest, hopefully he will recognize that it's also in the interest of the country for him to engage in those kinds of question-and-answer sessions. So I hope he'll work with his staff to continue to do that.\nQ: Going way beyond this one notable press conference, though -- I mean, there's been this effort on the part of the Trump team to call entire news organizations purveyors of fake news from time to time. I mean, sometimes those designations change, but that's been the case from the beginning of the campaign. And now that phrase, \"fake news,\" seems to be part of their criticism after certain reports have aired, or whatever. The President has had a lot to say about fake news lately and inaccuracies that are out there, but this seems to be like that designation is being turned on its head, that when certain elements are critical, now that's being labeled \"fake news,\" so it kind of muddies the line as to who's calling what fake.\nSo what are your concerns about that? I mean, do you feel like freedom of the press is going to be one of those things that can fall by the wayside?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly hope not. Our country benefits from a free and independent media holding those in power accountable. There are not a lot of countries where that's exactly what happens. In many countries, there's not this -- well, first of all, in some countries, there isn't a free and independent media. In other countries, there isn't the same tradition where there is -- tends to be a little friction between the press corps and those who are in positions of authority. So the United States is relatively unique in having and fostering that kind of environment because we believe that it's good for the country.\nAnd as I've mentioned before, the philosophy that I brought to this job is not to insist that all of you write stories or broadcast packages that make the President look good. If that were my charge I would have gotten fired a long time ago because I failed miserably. (Laughter.) My charge has been to try to facilitate a relationship between the White House Press Corps and the White House that provides you with the information and access that you need to help the American people understand what we're doing and why we're doing it.\nAnd the essence of that relationship will include some friction because the White House Press Corps, as you should, is always going to be demanding more -- more news conferences, more access, more transparency. That's your job. It's not your job to be satisfied; it's your job to be demanding more. So there's going to be some built-in friction. And I've often said that if there's a day that that friction doesn't exist, it's an indication that somebody on one side or the other isn't doing their job.\nSo what I've tried to do is to make sure that we -- that even as that friction exists, that we not allow that friction to prevent either side from being able to effectively do their job. If so much friction builds up that you get so frustrated that nobody will return your call, that may mean you're less likely to call and get to the bottom of the story. That's a natural human reaction. So I certainly want to prevent that from happening.\nOn the other side, if the White House gets so frustrated with the coverage that they say, well, I'm just not going to engage with the press anymore, they engage in some kind of bunker mentality, well, that's not going to be good either and that's certainly not going to improve our coverage.\nSo trying to keep the friction at a low boil -- at the risk of mixing metaphors -- is the job of the person who stands behind this podium every day. And that's what I've tried to do. And the President believes that that actually -- like I said, if you have confidence in the arguments that you're making and you've got confidence that there are professionals in the audience that actually want to use their skills as a journalist to get to the bottom of what's actually happening, you should have a lot of confidence about presenting your arguments. Because if you present your arguments in an effective way and you're actually doing the right thing, then you're going to end up persuading a lot of people about the wisdom of your approach.\nAnd I think the President's strong approval ratings right now I think is an indication that we might be on to something.\nQ: I guess to boil this down very simply, have you seen enough, or has the administration seen enough at this point to have real concerns about the way this new administration handles the press? Are you disturbed by it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that there's no doubt that there are a variety of substantive and stylistic differences between the incoming President and his team and the outgoing President and his team. And they extend to a variety of areas. They obviously have taken a different approach when it comes to dealing with the media. But all I can do, I think at this point, is to make a case about the virtues of the strategies that we've employed. But ultimately the incoming President and his team are going to implement strategies that they believe serves them and the country best. And we'll have to see what they choose.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks. Just to follow up on Michelle's line of questioning -- the Turkish President, President Erdogan, basically backed up President-elect Trump in how he handled the CNN reporter's questions yesterday, saying that he put him in his place. I know the White House has had a long history of criticizing the Turkish government's handling of the free press, so I'm wondering what your reaction is to the fact that Turkey seems to be happy with how President-elect Trump is handling the press so far.\nMR. EARNEST: I had not read about the Turkish President's comment, but I'm not particularly surprised, given the treatment of journalists by the government in Turkey.\nTurkey is a NATO ally, and the United States stands strongly with Turkey and works closely with Turkey to protect our mutual interests and also to protect the national security of Turkey. We continue to do that, and the American people and the world benefits from that close relationship. At the same time, that close relationship has not prevented us from speaking out and expressing our deeps concerns about the treatment of independent journalists in Turkey, who too often are imprisoned or silenced.\nI recall that even when a senior Turkish official traveled to the United States, there was a physical altercation between that senior official's security detail and Turkish journalists. That obviously was not something that the United States was prepared to tolerate on our soil, and we spoke out against it and, as I recall, there were security officials from the United States that intervened.\nI noted earlier, the United States and our tradition in this country and in our politics of having a robust, vigorous exchange between those in positions of authority and independent media is important, and we believe that that strengthens our democracy. And if you have confidence in the arguments that you're making, then you should have confidence in your ability to go and make that case to the press. And if you don't, it may not just raise questions about your strategy for dealing with the media, it may raise questions about the confidence you have in the arguments that you have to defend.\nQ: I have a question about -- a couple of my colleagues had an interview with the Vice President earlier, and the Vice President said that he believes that some of the President-elect's comments about the intelligence community, criticizing their actions so far, have already had a negative impact on our national security and have already helped Russia. Does the President agree with that assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I know that Director Clapper was asked about this before Congress last week, and he expressed his concern about the impact that some of the President-elect's comments could have on the morale of the men and women of the intelligence community. So I think Vice President Biden is expressing a concern that other leaders in the intelligence community have expressed.\nThe other thing that I'll say about this is something that I'm confident that Vice President Biden agrees with me on, which is that the men and women of the United States intelligence community are professionals and they are patriots, and they set aside their own ideological and political views when they are focused on their task. These are also individuals who are not likely to be cowed by criticism.\nSo I think -- I retain a lot of confidence that the men and women of the intelligence community are going to continue to do their job and do it as effectively as they ever have. And they make a substantial contribution to our national security. And President Obama has relied on them, the American people have relied on them to keep us safe over the last eight years, and we're going to be counting on them as much as we ever have to do the important work that they do every day to keep us safe.\nQ: Part of the interview -- part of the argument that the Vice President made in the interview was that, basically Russia is benefitting from sort of the chaos and the confusion over whether or not the intelligence community is correct or is right with their assessments, and he made the argument that the President-elect is fomenting some of that by questioning their values. So does the President agree that Russia is benefitting from this chaos, from this lack of certainty and the lack of confidence in the intelligence community being propagated by the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, there's no doubt that before the election, the intelligence community issued a statement indicating their belief -- their conclusion that Russia was engaged in malicious cyber activity to try to undermine public confidence in our election system and in our democracy. So that's -- again, I think the Vice President is just giving voice to something that the intelligence community observed before the election that Russia believed that they would somehow benefit from undermining confidence in our democracy.\nAnd that's obviously something that this administration takes quite seriously. That's why the President ordered such a vigorous response to those Russian efforts. That's why the President ordered the -- or directed the intelligence community to compile this report and to brief it to him, to the President-elect, and to members of Congress, because all of them are going to have a role moving forward in ensuring that the United States is protected from our adversaries, particularly those that are willing to try to undermine our democracy.\nRon.\nQ: In talking about the press conference yesterday, you said that some of the tough questioning was justified. I think you were saying this because some of the claims that were being made by Mr. Trump and his attorney. What were some of the more outrageous claims that were being made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to offer up my own commentary from here. I'll let other people make those kinds of observations about which particular comments they found to be particularly troubling, or offensive, or whatever else they may say.\nI think the point that I'm making is that the kind of contentious environment that was in place at the news conference -- and I think that was pretty obvious to everybody who was watching -- was not one-sided. I think it seemed pretty evident that the President-elect and his team felt like they were going to benefit from a pretty raucous environment in which some pretty strong charges were traded back and forth.\nAnd, look, the kinds of engagements that we have sought with the press have been of a different tone and tenor, but ultimately the incoming President and his team will have to determine exactly how they want these kinds of interactions to go and what kind of relationship he wants to have with the White House Press Corps.\nQ: I only brought it up because you said you've thought about it. On the issue of -- you may have answered this yesterday -- but on the general question of Mr. Trump and his business and these possible conflicts of interest and so forth, and how he has made this arrangement to address that, in his view -- what is the President's thinking about that?\nAnd I know you've said in the past how they have different financial situations and he went overboard to put his few thousand dollars in the -- someplace in bonds, I think it was when -- but just generally, what is the President's thinking about what Mr. Trump is doing, particularly given the concern that this could threaten -- that it could be something that could not just be embarrassing to him or threaten him but the country at large as a security issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there are obviously oversight responsibilities that are housed at the Office of Government Ethics. Congress has some important oversight responsibilities. There are important rules and regulations that are on the books. But what's also important is the standard that's set at the very top. And that's why the President -- why President Obama did undertake the extraordinary step of essentially liquidating all his assets, plowing them into treasuries.\nAnd as I pointed out before, that wasn't a smart financial decision because that coincided with a pretty dramatic reduction in interest rates, which hurt his return. But ultimately, that was a good decision for the country because there was no question about whether or not he had a financial motive to make a particular decision. He didn't. He was making a particular decision only because he believed it was in the best interest of the country, not because he had some ulterior financial motive, or there wasn't even the appearance that he could have a potential ulterior motive.\nThat served the country well. It took that question off the table. It also sent a strong signal to other officials in the United States government about the kind of ethical standard that they should maintain. This is a high standard that went above and beyond ethical regulations that were on the books. And that's why the President is extraordinarily proud of the fact that there hasn't been a major scandal in his administration over eight years.\nQ: Does the President think Mr. Trump should do more than he has in this area?\nMR. EARNEST: The President believes that Mr. Trump is going to make his own decisions about the most effective way to deal with this particular situation.\nI would stipulate, as the President has on a number of occasions, that Mr. Trump's financial situation, given his wealth, is more complicated than the situation that President Obama faced. So I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump has to do exactly the same thing that President Obama did. I think a reasonable person would acknowledge that it's going to have to be treated differently given the size of his wealth. But I know that there are a number of people who are experts in this field\n-- Democrats and Republicans -- who have expressed significant concern that the steps that were announced yesterday by the President-elect didn't go nearly far enough to resolve these kinds of questions.\nBut for the response to this, we're going to -- the American people are going to be relying on those agencies that have the responsibility of setting ethical standards, and we're going to also be relying on the United States Congress to provide the kind of oversight that must be provided, and ultimately the President-elect is going to have to decide what kind of leadership he wants to show.\nQ: Just one other thing. The Senate moved last night about -- on the Affordable Care Act and beginning to repeal Obamacare. What's the -- well, you've had a lot to say about this, so I'm trying to just kind of get to the nub of it.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Is this fight now over, or is there something still -- or do you --\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's only just begun. I was just looking -- because as somebody who has been doing this job for a couple of years, I've got an appreciation for people who are able to summarize a complex situation in a rather pithy phrase. Sometimes I'm able to do that; sometimes I'm not. But I can appreciate when somebody else does it well. And I did happen to notice, thanks to the eagle eye of one member of our staff, a comment from Congressman MacArthur from New Jersey -- this is a conservative Republican, somebody that I've never had a chance to meet. And when he was asked about the wisdom of the approach that Republicans were pursuing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and come up with a replacement at some indefinite point in the future, he put forward, I think, a rather apt metaphor. I don't have it in front of me unfortunately, but he said something like: I want to know -- before we take action with this loaded gun, I want to know where it's pointed.\nI think that is a pretty apt metaphor. There are going to be very serious consequences for repealing the Affordable Care Act, as we've discussed in here extensively. It's going to have life-and-death consequences for some people in this country. And before the trigger is pulled, the United States Congress should be wise to understand exactly where it's pointed. They should understand exactly what the consequences are going to be of them taking this action. They should understand who's going to be hurt. They should understand who's standing in the line of fire. Right now, there are 30 million Americans that are standing in the line of fire. Because if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, 30 million Americans are going to lose their health insurance. 130 million Americans, it was recently found, have a preexisting condition. And if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, those 130 million Americans are going to have protections stripped away that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, prevent insurance companies from discriminating against them because of the preexisting conditions. So the consequences are great for a great many number of Americans.\nSo I thought that was a pretty apt metaphor, with all compliments to Congressman MacArthur. I don't know if he'll consider it a compliment or not, but that's how I mean it.\nThere's one other statistic I thought that was interesting, and we can provide you some more details on this. In 2014 -- this is according to a government study -- in 2014, 1.4 million marketplace consumers were either self-employed, small business owners, or both. 1.4 million Americans who purchased their health insurance through the marketplace. So if those marketplaces go away, we're talking about small business owners who are going to be hurt. We're talking about people who are self-employed, people who try to start their own business are going to be hurt.\nAnd there was a study that was done about those states that have the highest share of small business owners who rely on marketplace coverage. These are states that represented in the United States Congress by Republicans. Idaho, Florida, Montana, Maine, and North Carolina have some of the highest share of small business owners who rely on the marketplace for health insurance coverage. So the senators from those states I think are going to have some explaining to do, why they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nBut I guess, to go back to your original question, no, this isn't over -- it's just beginning.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about the severe weather that seems to be plaguing many places in the West, in particular in California. Is the President aware of the flooding situation there? And has he been in contact, or has the White House been in contact with officials in the West to try to help mitigate the problem?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes -- this is a situation that the White House is following. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those whose lives have been upended by the severe weather, not just in California, but throughout the West. So this is something that we continue to watch closely.\nObviously, my colleagues at FEMA are the ones who are directly in touch with state and local first responders to make sure that they have the resources that they need. We can check on what sort of White House communications there have been with state and local officials, but I'd refer you to my colleagues at FEMA who can give you a better account of what kinds of conversations they've had with officials at the local level who are responding to the situation and trying to meet the immediate needs of those Americans whose lives have been significantly affected by this dangerous winter storm.\nQ: No disaster declarations as yet?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of, but we can certainly track -- we can track that for you.\nQ: Thanks. As far as the U.S. response to -- how do I put this -- there has been some concerns by many people watching the destabilizing of Eastern Europe for quite some time. And as a response to that, and in an attempt to further secure the safety and security of many of our allies in that part of the world, the U.S. is now poised to put troops, I'm understanding, in Poland. Can you give an update on that? And what's the thinking behind making a decision like that, which will be seen as provocative by some, say, the Kremlin, for example?\nMR. EARNEST: So, Kevin, as you'll recall, when we were at the NATO Summit over the summer, in Poland, coincidentally enough, that this was an announcement that was made by our NATO allies to increase the deployment of military forces on NATO's eastern flank. This included in the Baltics and in Poland. And the United States, Canada, and a couple of other NATO members were deploying troops to NATO's eastern flank to shore up our defenses.\nWe made very clear from the beginning -- and let me repeat -- this deployment is defensive in nature; it is intended entirely to shore up our defenses along the eastern flank. It is motivated, at least in part, by some of the destabilizing and even escalatory actions that the Russian military has undertaken over the last year or so. We continue to be concerned about that. So I think this does -- I know that the announcement about the deployment of U.S. troops is indicative of the depth of this administration's and this country's commitment to our NATO Alliance.\nFor the operational details about sort of the timing -- I know that some of these movements have already begun -- but for the number of troops and the equipment that's been deployed, or will be deployed, it's something that my colleagues at the Department of Defense can help you understand.\nQ: Let me stay on that for just a second. In terms of Russia, Vice President Biden made some interesting comments about the decrease in our nuclear stockpile while the Russians continue to not only maintain -- in fact, they're attempting to -- he didn't say \"grow,\" but they certainly have not decreased their stockpile. I'm just curious, now that we're going to be going into a new administration, how concerned is the White House now, this administration, as it leaves that the posture, the American posture in terms of nuclear stockpile management -- decreases -- will change under a Trump administration -- potentially change?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll leave it to the next administration to describe what their plans are. I certainly can help you understand what our approach has been, and our approach has been -- you know, you'll recall that early in this administration, in 2010, Congress -- the Senate did ratify the New START Treaty that did make commitments to the -- that did put into force commitments that were made by the United States and Russia to reduce our nuclear stockpiles. And that obviously was an important step to promote the security not just of the United States and Russia, but of countries all around the world.\nQ: Are they living up to it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll refer you to the State Department for an updated assessment of exactly what they have done. We have been pleased with some of the steps that they have taken. We have been concerned with some of the other steps that they have taken. But for a detailed accounting of how all that washes out, I'd refer you to the State Department.\nBut what the United States has done is preserved our ability, beyond any doubt, to protect the United States and to protect the American people. That's not going to change, and we continue to be confident of that. In fact, President Obama has proposed a significant investment in modernizing our arsenal of nuclear weapons to ensure that they remain modernized, effective, to minimize the risk of any mistakes or accidents, and to ensure that that arsenal is in place to protect the American people.\nBut the stockpile reduction that the Vice President discussed yesterday would enhance our national security. It is consistent with the way that we have tried to implement a policy to ensure that the United States of America is protected even as we make some reasonable steps -- take some reasonable steps to reduce the risk of proliferation, reduce the risk of an accident or disaster, and reduce the cost to taxpayers. As we reduce the stockpile, we can reduce the resources that are necessary to protect it, to modernize it. This would also be in the category of ensuring that we are efficiently and effectively using taxpayer dollars.\nQ: Even if the Russians don't follow suit and reduce their stockpile?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, what we have seen, we have seen some steps that were taken by Russia to reduce their stockpile. There are some other steps they've taken that we haven't been particularly happy with. But we continue to be focused on ensuring that all the necessary steps are taken to protect the United States of America. That's been true over the last eight years, and that will be true until the President's last day in office.\nQ: And last one. Has the United States ever engaged in malicious cyber activity in an attempt to undermine the leadership of another country?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't have any covert cyber operations to talk about from here. That may not be surprising to you. But --\nQ: Because you mentioned that Russia did, and our intelligence officials say they did. The pushback I've read is, well, the U.S. does it, too. And so because we're not privy to that information I'm always curious how we can look at someone else and say, well, they're doing this and they're doing that, when, in fact -- or at least in principle -- we certainly might be doing something similar.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just say as a general matter with regard to Russia's activity in the context of the 2016 election, it is not accurate to say that the United States did it first. What I can tell you is something that the President himself has said, which is the United States retains significant offensive cyber capabilities. Those offensive cyber capabilities are much stronger than the capabilities that are retained by any other country. And the work to ensure that we maintain that edge continues.\nBut what's also true is, given the advanced nature of our economy, and given the way that our economy and our way of life is quite dependent on the Internet and being able to remain connected, the United States is also vulnerable in this realm in a way that a lot of other countries aren't, which makes this a particularly thorny policy situation that the next administration is going to have to deal with. Of course, this administration has been very forceful not just in developing our offensive capabilities but also in strengthening and refining our defensive capabilities.\nAnd unfortunately, we've not gotten the support from the Congress that we would like to further invest in those defensive capabilities. And maybe the Republicans in Congress will be more receptive to those kinds of arguments that are made by a Republican President -- because the fact is the country has been hurt by the failure of Republicans in Congress to act on the specific recommendations that we put forward with regard to enhancing our cybersecurity.\nMargaret.\nQ: Vice President Biden told reporters earlier today that he was surprised that those unverified claims regarding the President-elect and Russia were brought to his level and the attention of the President. Did President Obama also have that reaction? Was he surprised that it reached his desk?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about that. I know that there is a reference to this in the statement that Director Clapper issued last night, but he obviously has a longer leash when it comes to discussing classified information or information that has been presented in classified form to senior officials, including the President. I just don't have quite that latitude.\nSo with regard to the decision about what to include in an intelligence briefing that's presented to the President of the United States, that's certainly something that Director Clapper can speak to.\nQ: You started off talking about China and then a trade option that was taken. Was that coordinated with the incoming administration, this decision to go to the WTO? And the detailed factsheet put out underscores how much this dumping of metals has hurt American workers. Is there any sense of regret in the administration not having acted earlier, given the amount of angst and rhetoric there's been about American workers not being defended enough by this administration, at least on the campaign trail?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think when you consider the entirety of the record that I laid out at the beginning, I think there is no legitimate argument to be made about the forceful efforts that we've undertaken to protect the American people and protect the American economy from unfair trade practices originating anywhere around the world, but particularly in China. That is something that we have made a priority, and the American people and our economy have benefitted from it.\nWith regard to the timing of this announcement, I would just note that there were, as I mentioned, numerous bilateral efforts by the Obama administration to persuade China to take strong steps to address the excess capacity in the aluminum sector. So that would explain the timing, which is, we tried to work this out before we went and filed the case at the WTO.\nBut we haven't shown any hesitation about filing cases with the WTO. The United States, under President Obama's leadership, has filed more cases at the WTO than any other country in the world. And all of the cases that have been decided have been decided -- that we have filed are cases that we've won. So that, I think, should be an indication of just how rigorous a process we pursue in protecting the American people, in protecting the American economy, and, most importantly, protecting American workers.\nI think it would probably be an overstatement to suggest that we coordinated this announcement with the incoming administration, but I'm sure that they were informed one way or another this step as we were taking it.\nQ: As recently I think as September, President Obama brought this up with Xi when he was in China.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: So you're saying the President's own personal attempts to persuade Chinese leadership failed? That's what led to this decision to file a complaint?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what you can assume is that these kinds of matters are important enough to President Obama that he doesn't hesitate to raise them at the highest levels of the Chinese government. And when we don't see the kind of response that we would like to see, on the timeline that we would like to see it, then we don't hesitate to go to the World Trade Organization and hold them accountable for their actions. And thus far, when we've done that, we haven't lost a case.\nQ: Lastly, you also had a number of announcements from the State Department, from Treasury, and then from the NSC here in regard to Syria touting the first actions against Syrian officials for using chemical weapons. Why did it take so long, given that your own releases acknowledged that there were attacks in 2013 and every year since the initial U.S.-recognized attack that nearly led to U.S. military action? Why now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I think it's important to understand that this was obviously not the only response. The United States did succeed in 2014, in working closely with Russia, to persuade the Assad regime to declare the existence of their chemical weapons stockpile, to cooperate with an international effort to secure those weapons and destroy them. And that, obviously, is a step that didn't just enhance the security of the people in Syria who were facing the brunt of these chemical attacks, but it also reduced -- it eliminated the risk that any of those weapons would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them other places.\nSo we obviously were pleased about the impact of that step. What we have been concerned about since has been the willingness of the Assad regime to weaponized otherwise legitimate industrial compounds, like chlorine, and use them to wreak havoc, attack, wound, and kill innocent people, innocent Syrians. And so that's why, again, you've seen the forceful response both in terms of the priority we placed in rounding up and destroying their declared chemical weapons stockpile, but also in terms of holding accountable, at least through financial sanctions, those who were involved in producing these weapons and carrying out these attacks.\nThere have also been international efforts that have been supported by the United States to have a broader international investigation into war crimes about the use of these kinds of tactics and the use of these kinds of weapons. So I think you have seen -- I know you have seen a robust response from the United States with regard to the use of chemical weapons that is commensurate with the national security interests that this question raises for the United States of America.\nQ: But the administration has called out the use of weaponized chemicals for years now, post that agreement that you reference -- in fact, in violation, you've also said, of that agreement in many ways, at least in principle. So why now sanction if these are well-recognized attacks? At least from a unilateral position, these sanctions could have happened much earlier.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with regard to the precise timing for these individuals, when they were put forward, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department, because obviously they have to do the forensic work to determine exactly the most effective way to implement these kinds of penalties. This obviously stems from the intensive investigations that they do in the financial sector. They obviously work closely with the intelligence community to develop these options. But it does indicate another element of our forceful response on this matter.\nQ: So would it be wrong to assume that the U.S. attempts at diplomatic efforts with the Assad regime via Russia, and the long, drawn-out, ultimately fruitless process is actually what caused the administration to pause before acting?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think you'd have to ask the Treasury Department for the precise timing. I think what is true is that Russia has failed time and time again to get their client-state in line. They have refused to stand up to them. They refused to persuade them. And I don't know if that's because they are unwilling to make a forceful case, or they're unable to get the weakened Assad regime, their only client-state in the Middle East, to listen to them. And that's been a subject of disappointment, and there have been a lot of lives lost as a result of Russia's failure on that score. But for why exactly that happened, I guess you could consult with the Russians.\nAndrew.\nQ: The Justice Department inspector general is going to investigate FBI actions before the election with regard the probe into Hillary Clinton's email server. Is that something that has been supported or sanctioned by the White House? And what questions do you think remain open about the FBI's behavior regarding this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, decisions that are made by inspectors general across the administration are independent. And this administration has assiduously protected the independence of inspectors general, so we wouldn't weigh in publicly or privately on any sort of investigative decision that's made by an inspector general. Presumably, the stakes are even higher for an inspector general who has a responsibility for conducting these kinds of investigations of independent law enforcement agencies.\nSo I can tell you that the White House was not involved in that decision. And anything the inspector general chooses to investigate is something that he will do -- he or she will do based on their view of the situation, based on their own knowledge of the facts. And hopefully they will follow the evidence where it leads, if they find any evidence.\nQ: And a Chinese aircraft carrier into Taiwanese not exactly territorial waters, but the Air Identification Zone -- I wondered if you had a reaction to that, if the U.S. government stepped in in any way to kind of defuse that situation.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a formal U.S. government response to that matter to share with you. We can see if there was any sort of reciprocal action or response from the U.S. with regard to that specific operation that was carried out by the Chinese navy.\nWhat I can tell you is we have long encouraged both sides to look for ways to prevent tensions from escalating, and we believe that -- look, one of the goals of our one-China policy is to prevent tensions from escalating, both because we don't want tensions about that matter to interfere with our ability to work with China on a range of areas where we can make progress together, but also because obviously we value our interactions with the Taiwanese, including with regard to our trading relationship with them.\nBut for a more specific response to this Chinese military operation, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense.\nQ: Okay. And you referenced the one-China policy. Do you -- are you drawing a line between what Trump did with regard to the telephone call and what the Chinese are doing?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm just trying to do is to restate the policy that we have pursued, and the reason for it. And there are a variety of reasons for it, but one of them is that we believe it's in the interest of the United States for tensions in that region of the world to not escalate, particularly between China and Taiwan. And the effective implementation of the one-China policy has been largely successful on that score. But obviously the incoming administration will have to make up their own mind about how and whether to pursue their relationship with China and with Taiwan.\nBill.\nQ: Josh, it's been reported that Chelsea Manning is on the President's short list for commutation or pardon. Can you confirm that?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't. I've seen those reports, of course. There is a well-established process for individuals to seek clemency from the President of the United States. That is a process that has been organized by the Department of Justice who will review those petitions for clemency. But I don't have any comment on any of the petitions that have been submitted thus far. I can't even confirm the existence of a petition or rely on those who are filing the petitions to indicate whether or not they filed them. And this applies not just to people like Chelsea Manning, but also applies to people like Governor Rod Blagojevich whose representatives have made clear that he would like some clemency from the President of the United States. But I just don't have any comment on those potential applications.\nQ: There is an organized set process, correct. There's also a limited amount of time before the President can act. It was rumored that he might make those announcements yesterday. Can you give us any idea when we could expect them?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update on timing of any potential clemency announcements.\nQ: This week?\nMR. EARNEST: I just don't have any update on that.\nJohn.\nQ: The Congressional Progressive Caucus has written a letter to President Obama, signed by 40 other Democrats, imploring the President to take bold action to follow up on his campaign promise to close Guantanamo. And the main point was that they didn't want to give President-elect Trump another tool to place detainees in the future. Is the President going to be able to respond in a manner that the CPC is going to look upon favorably?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not seen the letter from the CPC. I can tell you that the President has obviously made the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay a top priority. There's a reason that he announced his proposal to close the prison on his, I believe, it was his first or second full day in office. So the President has made this a priority, and there are a number of reforms with regard to national security that we have successfully implemented, including in the use of torture.\nBut with regard to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, we've encountered significant obstacles from Congress -- Democrats and Republicans, disappointingly. And what the President has pursued is an effort to responsibly review the case files of every detainee. Those case files were reviewed by representatives from six different national security agencies. A large number of those detainees were approved for transfer to other countries under a set of specific security requirements that would limit their ability to strengthen the United States once they were transferred.\nBy implementing that process, we have succeeded in dramatically reducing the population at Guantanamo Bay. It's down in the mid-50s I believe, last time I checked. And if there are additional transfers to tell you about, we'll certainly make those -- if there are additional transfers, we will tell you about them. We always announce them publicly. But the President believes that this is in the best interest of the country, both because there are significant taxpayer dollars that are expended to maintain the prison there. It's inefficient to maintain that facility. And we're spending too much money to house those detainees when you consider that they could be housed at a much lower cost in the United States and would not endanger the American people.\nWe also know -- and this is something that military officials have also concluded, national security experts in both parties have concluded -- that we know that terrorist organizations are using the continuing operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool. And I think that's an indication of an unwise policy, to put it mildly. So that's why the President has made a forceful case. Unfortunately, we've run into far too many obstacles in Congress, but we've made a lot of progress in getting the population of the prison at Guantanamo Bay down to a much smaller level.\nQ: Does the President share concerns with the CPC that he's leaving a tool out there for Donald Trump to use and that they'll just reverse the progress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have been concerned by some of the rhetoric that we heard during the campaign about the potential that the incoming President would fill it up, I think he colorfully described the prison there. That obviously is inconsistent with the policy that we have implemented. The Obama administration has never transferred somebody to the prison at Guantanamo Bay. We have been able to rely upon the strength of our criminal justice system to detain, prosecute, and put away terrorists that threaten the United States. We have not had to rely on the prison at Guantanamo Bay to do that. So I think the President's record, when it comes to implementing a foreign policy that keeps us safe and is consistent with our values, is quite strong and one that the next administration will be challenged to live up to.\nQ: Two quick, lighter questions. Our cameras caught the President over on the steps of the EEOB shaking hands with staff. Could you tell us what was happening there? Was he just thanking them for their service?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe -- and we can double-check this -- that the President was greeting and taking a picture with members of the United States Digital Service. You'll recall that one of the President's initiatives was actually to recruit some of the best talent from Silicon Valley. These were individuals who have a particular expertise when it comes to technology. And many of them, after working in Silicon Valley, determined that they wanted to pursue a career in public service. So they have been, in some cases, volunteering their time to go work at government agencies and help improve what government agencies do to protect their networks from malicious cyber activity; to make their communication with the public more seamless and more effective; to help them refine the decisions that they're making with regard to procuring IT technology -- or IT equipment to enhance their systems.\nThere's a lot of work that can be done to improve the way the government uses technology to be more effective and to keep us safe. And so the President has got a soft spot for the men and women who have signed up for that service. Many of them are individuals who could be making a whole lot more money in the private sector, but because of their commitment to this country and their patriotism, they're serving this country in the United States Digital Service. And the President is grateful to them for their work, and the work that they have done has made a genuine impact on the American people and on the way the federal government serves the people.\nQ: You also said the President will take the First Lady someplace warm after they leave office next Friday. I was just looking ahead on the 10-day forecast and some of the hot spots that the President has gone to lately -- or frequently, actually. (Laughter.) And in Honolulu, it's going to be in the mid-70s, but chance of rain --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: -- probably not ideal, right? (Laughter.) Palm Springs, kind of in the low 60s -- it's 65 degrees here today. So weather can be unpredictable. (Laughter.) Do you have any more to say about where the President might go when he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't at this point. I admire your investigative journalism, though. (Laughter.) That was excellent work. The President is looking forward to getting out of town, and hopefully the weather will cooperate, regardless of where they go.\nQ: Ginger Zee has nothing to worry about. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: John, in the back.\nQ: Back to the Justice IG review. What do you make that Justice is saying they decided to do this review at the behest of multiple not just ranking members, Democrats, but Republican chairmen around the election? We heard a lot about, it's just sour grapes, it's inconsequential, not going to affect the election -- or it didn't affect the election. What do you make of Republicans wanting this review?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I can't speak to the conversations that the Inspector General has had with members of Congress, so I'll let the Inspector General speak for himself or herself with regard to why they chose to pursue this investigation.\nQ: And last week you mentioned, as far as who is the leader of the Democratic Party next Friday at around 12:01 p.m., you said it might be by committee. You and I are probably familiar with the old saying, if you have two or three quarterbacks, you don't even have one. So when the President gets back from destination to be determined on his vacation, and he's concerned or has advice, who is that one person he calls?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it is the nature of the Democratic Party that it functions most effectively when it's energized from the ground up and when you have leaders in the Democratic Party who are responsive to the grassroots, to Democrats who aren't in elected positions in communities all across the country. It is true that the President in power is the nominal head of his party, and when he's not, there are other people who have to step up and take leadership positions. So I certainly would anticipate that people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will play a leading role. I know that Governor McAuliffe in the Commonwealth of Virginia plays a leading role in working with Democratic governors across the country, and I certainly would expect him to continue to be a leading voice among Democrats.\nBut what the President has also said is that his departure from the national stage will create an opening for others who we may not have heard of at this point to step up and to make their voices heard. I've often compared, particularly to some of our younger staff, the situation that the Democratic Party is in right now to the situation that the Democratic Party faced in 2001. That was also a situation in which a Democratic President was leaving office under circumstances that Democrats across the country were deeply disappointed by, to put it mildly. And you also had the Republican control of Capitol Hill, and there were questions being raised about who was going to lead the Democratic Party at that point.\nAnd with the exception of some people who lived in the 312 area code, I don't think there was anybody that had ever heard of Barack Obama. But seven years later, he was elected President of the United States. So he was obviously somebody that -- I think there are plenty of reasons to, even looking back, to think about some of the possibilities, had Vice President Gore won that election, but it's hard to imagine a scenario that Barack Obama would be President right now, had Al Gore won that election.\nSo his departure from the national stage, as sad and disappointing as it was at the time, did create an opening for new voices. And one of those voices belongs to Barack Obama, who later had a profound impact on our country and certainly on the Democratic Party. So it will be quite interesting to see, and I'll certainly be watching to see what kinds of men and women choose to step up and take advantage of this opportunity.\nJared.\nQ: Josh, while you're staring into the abyss, earlier you mentioned the Affordable Care Act repeal and you said --\nMR. EARNEST: Not quite that dark yet, man.\nQ: Darkest timeline. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) If you had asked me in November, I might not have said anything, but --\nQ: You said earlier that repeal -- this is only just begun. And while that is meticulously and technically accurate, it's also a little ominous. What can the administration do at this point other than cajole? It's like the President had a pen and a phone, and now he's just going to have a phone. What can he do at this point to influence this process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he'll be using his pen to write a book that hopefully you'll buy at some point. (Laughter.)\nBut more seriously, the reference that I made to Ron -- I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to clarify this. What has just begun is the effort by Democrats to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's what's just begun. And the fact that Republicans were able to pass that budget resolution by the slimmest of margins when you consider that Joe Biden is still the Vice President of the United States. And so they'll enhance their margin by one once Mike Pence is sworn in as the President of the Senate, as Vice President.\nSo there's not much margin for error for Republicans, and when you look at the public statements of Republicans who are quite uneasy, including Congressman MacArthur, who I cited earlier, that's why I think you see a lot of confidence on the part of the President and other Democrats about our ability to make a very forceful case that Republicans shouldn't repeal the health care of 30 million Americans; that Republicans shouldn't take away the kinds of consumer protections that ensure people have access to free check-ups and the ability to include their kids on their health insurance until they're age 26; that ensure that policies that extend the health and life of the Medicare Trust Fund are preserved; that ensure that senior continue to enjoy the hundreds of dollars a year that they get that make their prescription drugs more affordable. These are all good benefits that are at risk when Republicans say they're going to repeal the Affordable Care Act without putting forward a replacement. So the work to protect the Affordable Care Act has only just begun.\nQ: On a separate topic, the Office of Government Ethics rules say that executive branch employees -- and forgive me for reading this here -- may not use government positions to suggest that the agency or any part of the executive branch endorses an organization, products, service, or person. Is it appropriate for the President-elect to tweet that someone should buy LL Bean products, particularly given that the person involved is a super PAC donor for the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly raises questions, and I think you alluded to a couple of them, even in the context of the one question that you asked.\nI do think that this brings to the fore the need for ethics officials in Congress to conduct the important oversight work that they're charged with conducting. Obviously, all of you as journalists and as agents of the American people, and defenders of transparency, and advocates for accountability, all of you have a role in this as well. But I'm not going to pass judgement on an individual tweet from the President-elect. I'll let his team explain what he was trying to convey and why it doesn't run afoul of the ethical regulations that you've just cited.\nQ: I haven't -- I don't recall the President doing anything like that in the last eight years. Has he -- would he do something like that? Would President Obama do something like that?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly don't recall the President doing something like that. I do recall a situation in which the President was photographed wearing a particular company's jacket on the Great Wall of China, and that company, seeking to capitalize on the publicity, put up a billboard in Times Square, I believe. And rather than endorse the product, the White House contacted the company and asked them to remove that billboard. So it's apparent that we've taken a different approach with regard to the President's endorsement of outerwear. (Laughter.)\nJC, you had your hand up. I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Sure. I'm sure we appreciates the appellations you just gave us -- defender of transparency, et cetera. It's quite remarkable, thank you.\nYou also mentioned earlier some of the frustrations you've had with members of the press corps. You did not act on them, no one went out the door -- not when I was here. Can you just reflect on a few of the positive moments that you've had in this room? And also, if I may, just -- and do you think these press briefings should continue on a daily basis?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I do think that the press briefings should continue on a daily basis. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that they serve the American people very well. The President believes that engaging in these briefings serves his administration well. It gives us an opportunity to make a forceful argument in favor of the policies that he's advanced. And again, if you have confidence in the arguments that you're making, then you're not going to have any hesitation to make those arguments to people who are trying to understand exactly what the best thing to do is.\nSo I believe that these kinds of engagements are valuable, the President does too. But ultimately, the incoming administration will have to decide what the best course of action is. At the same time, I wouldn't say that these kinds of engagements are perfect, so I'm not suggesting that there shouldn't be any changes made. But protecting the core nature of these regular engagements, where all of you have an opportunity to demand accountability and demand transparency and demand answers to legitimate questions about what the President is doing and why he's doing it, I think is an entirely fair process and it's a process that's good for our country. So hopefully it's one that will continue.\nQ: And will you hold off until next week your highlights that you might want to share with us?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, maybe I'll try to come up with some between now and -- (laughter) -- I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.\nThanks, guys. I will be back tomorrow. I'll see you then.\nQ: Question quickly -- there's a story out there about an incident involving a White House guest and a dog fight -- Sunny -- apparently earlier this week. Anything?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen anything on this, but we can take a look at it for you.\nThanks, guys.\n1:53 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121381", "text": "Via Telephone\n5:55 P.M. EST\nMR. PRICE: Good evening, everyone, and thanks so much for joining this call, especially on such short notice. We wanted to convene this call to discuss the changes to the policies and regulations affecting Cuban nationals that were announced late this afternoon. First, the ground rules. This call is on the record. We have on this call, for your awareness, Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor. We also have the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, along with another senior DHS official for question.\nWe'll do this call on the record, but it will be embargoed until the conclusion, so we ask that you please not use this material until the call concludes.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Secretary Johnson to begin.\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: Good evening. This is Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security. As part of the normalization of relations with the government of Cuba, effective immediately I have repealed the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy with regard to Cuban migrants that has been in place since the mid-1990s. Going forward, those Cuban migrants who arrive in the United States illegally, with some exceptions which I'll get into in a moment, will be subject to deportation consistent with our laws and our immigration enforcement priorities.\nTo the extent permitted by the laws of both our countries, the aim here is to treat Cuban migrants in a manner consistent with migrants who come here illegally from other countries, particularly other countries in the same region. This is a move toward equalizing our immigration policies with regard to those who come here illegally as part of the overall normalization process with the government of Cuba.\nAlong with the repeal of the policy, which I have done today, this is a product of an agreement with the government of Cuba. Essentially, what the agreement means is that past is past, but that the future will be different with regard our migration relationship with the government of Cuba. Going forward, if a Cuban migrants arrives here illegally, the Cuban government has agreed to accept that person back, specifically if the time -- between the time a Cuban migrant leaves Cuba, as demonstrated to us by the Cuban government, and the time that we commence a deportation proceeding against the individual is less than four years, the Cuban government has agreed to take that person back.\nNow, the reason for the four-year period is because of the existence of a law in Cuba enacted in response to the Cuban Adjustment Act of the United States, the law in Cuba essentially says that if a person has left Cuba, after two years they are considered to have effectively migrated from Cuba. In the course of our negotiations, the Cuban government agreed, therefore, that if a person has been out of Cuba more than four years because the time they left and the time we commenced a deportation proceeding against them, which tolls that clock, they will take that migrant back.\nUltimately, we seek to get to a place fully consistent with the international law under which the Cubans will agree to accept everyone back who is ordered deported by our country. This is regarded by us as an interim arrangement until their laws are repealed. We also welcome repeal by Congress, by our Congress, of the Cuban Adjustment Act.\nUnder our agreement with Cuba, there was also the possibility that the Cubans will accept back migrants outside of this arrangement, but on a case-by-case basis. We are also today repealing the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which you should be familiar with. That, too, is effective immediately. We are leaving in place the Cuban Family Reunification Program. That program will continue.\nI'll also add that with regard to interdictions of Cuban migrants at sea, by our Coast Guard, that is status quo. That policy and that approach will continue, as well.\nSo I'm happy to take any questions. But first, let me turn it over to Ben Rhodes if he has any comments.\nMR. RHODES: Thanks, Jeh. Just a few contextual points. This grows out of the normalization of relations between our countries. What we've seen in recent years is a continued uptick in Cuban migrants coming to the United States. We attribute that to a variety of factors -- one, that Cuba has liberalized its own exit policies with respect to Cubans leaving the country; two, the change in our policy -- the normalization of relations that began on December 17, 2014 -- I think created an expectation in Cuba that this change might take place and therefore people were motivated to migrate. Also, though, the increase in resources available to the Cuban people, particularly through our remittance policies, also made it more possible for Cubans to travel.\nWhat we've seen, therefore, is a steady increase to some 40,000 Cubans granted parole in fiscal year 2015; 54,000 roughly in fiscal year 2016. And what we had also seen is a growing number of Cubans who had begun a journey to try to reach the United States who were in a variety of Central American countries that was creating both humanitarian challenges and strains within those countries as large numbers of Cubans were essentially stuck there and then facing a very difficult and dangerous -- journey to our southern border in some cases.\nSo we wanted to ensure that we normalized our migration policies to the extent that we could and that we brought them in line with the way in which we treat other countries, as Jeh referenced. And so, again, what this does going forward is repeal the \"wet foot, dry foot\" provision such that we are returning to Cuba those people who come into our custody who traveled here illegally.\nI'd just say a couple of other things here. Ultimately, of course, we believe that we'd like to see people be able to increase their economic prospects within Cuba. That is why we have taken steps to open up a greater commercial and people-to-people relationship, and have encouraged the Cuban government to pursue economic reforms. That, ultimately, is the best way to ensure opportunity for the Cuban people going forward.\nAnd lastly, as Jeh said, the Cuban Adjustment Act is the legislative architecture around these policies. That provides preferences including adjusted status, green card status, and certain benefits to Cubans who are paroled into the country. That remains statute. But obviously under this change, we will not be granting parole to people who arrive here illegally by land or by sea. We do believe it would be the appropriate step for Congress to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act, even with the four-year clock that is embedded into Cuban law that, frankly, provides Congress with four years within which to assure full normalization of these policies to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act. And the Cubans have indicated that they will repeal their law, which is reciprocal to the Cuban Adjustment Act if and when Congress takes that action.\nAnd with that, we're happy to move to questions.\nQ: Thank you both so much for doing this call. I was just wondering, for the last two years whenever the topic of \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy came up, the administration was adamant that the rule belonged to the Cuban Adjustment Act and, as an act of Congress, it had to be repealed by Congress, even if it was discussed as a presidential fiat. So why do this now with only a week left in the administration? And what changed that made you decide that this was possible and something that could be rescinded?\nMR. RHODES: Well, Serena, a couple of things. First of all, we've been working sequentially through the normalization process. So there was the initial announcement December 17th, then we had to establish embassies, then we were focused on making a series of regulatory changes. So part of this was we arrived at the issue of migration later in the process. That's the first point I'd make.\nThe second point I'd make is that we saw the increase in migration, which I think is attributable to the factors I mentioned -- the liberalization of Cuba's own exit policies, the increased resources, particularly through remittances for Cubans, and, frankly, just the expectation in Cuba that this change might happen. And that increased the sense of urgency.\nBut the last point, which is an important one, is this policy is often discussed here as if it is purely unilateral. But for this to work, the Cubans had to agree to take people back. And we did not have that indication from them -- it was not part of my discussions with them leading up to December 17th and after. And it was only in recent years, as the uptick in migration continued, that they entered into those discussions with us. And then we, again, had to determine how to ensure that this was the best possible agreement, even as we both knew that our laws were in place -- in other words, the Cuban Adjustment Act, which the Cubans object to, was still in place. The Cubans made the adjustment to their law to extend this clock to four years, so it took time to negotiate various elements.\nBut again, I think this was the appropriate step at the appropriate time, and it makes sense from a perspective of our Cuba policy, it makes sense from a perspective of our immigration policy.\nLook, the last thing I'd say is -- we do get asked about this a lot -- frankly, we did not want to speculate publicly about the likelihood of this change for fear of inviting even greater migration flows, and everything we said is actually entirely what we believe, which is that we do think Congress should repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act. It's the cleanest way to fully normalize our immigration relationship.\nQ: Hi, hi, thank you for doing this, and my apologies because I was late to the call, so I'm not sure if you already talked about that, but I was wondering what are the Cubans agreeing to -- the Cuban government? Are they agreeing to taking all Cubans back, including those with deportation orders? Is this happening, as well? And also, can you set a timeframe, just to find out -- just to realize what's going to happen with those Cubans, I don't know, now entering the border in Mexico? What's going to happen to them?\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: I'll take that. Essentially, as I described in the first part of the call, what we've agreed to is, past is past and future will be different. Going forward, the Cuban government has agreed to take back those who have been ordered by an immigration court, deported from this country. Consistent with our laws, we will still hear claims for asylum like we do for everybody else.\nAnd I explained earlier that if the period of time between the time they left and the time we begin a deportation is four years or less, they have agreed to take them back. The reason for the four years is because of the state of their laws in Cuba, which we expect will be repealed as part of the normalization process, and so that's generally how it works.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, interdictions at sea will continue, and those people will be returned as well.\nMR. RHODES: I'd just add one thing. As Jeh indicated, it's a prospective policy. Going forward, the Cubans will be taking people back. Looking back, in addition to the case-by-case review that we can seek for individuals who have removal orders, you'll note in the joint statement that Cuba has agreed to accept the list of 2,746 people out of the Mariel boatlift. So there is a particular agreed-upon list of individuals who have procedure for return. But our goal was to set the policy direction going forward and to normalize, essentially, this migration relationship prospectively.\nThere's obviously an enormous number of -- there's a very large Cuban American population, and many Cuban migrants are already here. It was going to be too complicated, frankly, to significantly return people who are already here. We wanted to get things right going forward.\nQ: Hi. So just the first question I wanted to make sure I understood. So this would not impact Cubans who are already here? And so I just wanted to make sure I was clear on that. So this will be Cubans migrating to the country going forward?\nAnd the second part was -- I'm obviously not an expert on this -- but it was my understanding that also under the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy there was a lottery for a certain number -- 20,000 or so Cubans -- who could come here each year through that, and that also under the policy the U.S. was less, I don't know, vigilant in deporting Cubans who'd committed some sort of deportable offense. So I wondered if I'm correct on those points, if those also will change -- the lottery will go away, and the U.S. would become more aggressive at deporting Cubans who have made some sort of deportable offense.\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: Let me take that. First of all, the policy, as Ben mentioned, is prospective. Going forward, effective immediately, those who arrive here going forward.\nWith regard to your question about the lottery, I'm going to turn it over to a DHS senior official. Go ahead.\nDHS SENIOR OFFICIAL: Hi. So under our agreement -- so the 20,000 -- so we agreed in the 1994-95 Migration Accords with Cuba that we would accept for admission 20,000 Cubans per year. That continues to be the case under this agreement. This new agreement does not change that commitment by the United States.\nMR. RHODES: But again, those are people who would come here through authorized procedures. So what this does is allow us to deal with Cubans arriving irregularly by land, as well as sea.\nQ: Hi, good afternoon. I saw a statement by Senator Menendez saying that Congress was not consulted on this. I just wanted to confirm that with you.\nAnd I also wanted to know -- the Cuban Adjustment Act actually leaves a lot of discretion for the Attorney General to grant -- well, a lot of this question for him to decide on whether to grant that green card for Cubans who have been here a year. So I was wondering, since you think that Congress should lift the act, do you also think that the Attorney General should exercise that discretion and stop granting parole to -- well, granting residency to Cubans who have been here a year legally?\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: The discussions leading up to this were very sensitive. The policy that we're announcing today is effective immediately. We did not want for there to be a mass exodus from Cuba in anticipation of a change in policy. So these were very sensitive discussions. And I'm going to turn it over to the DHS senior official to describe how the Cuban Adjustment Act works.\nOne point I'll make is, references in the law to the Attorney General back then now are to me, the Secretary of Homeland Security, because DHS was created after the enactment of the law.\nGo ahead.\nDHS SENIOR OFFICIAL: So I think the point you're trying to raise is that to some degree the decision whether to adjust the status of a Cuban national who has been paroled into the United States under the Cuban Adjustment Act is discretionary. I don't know if you can still -- is that the point you were trying to make?\nWell, I'm assuming that's the point you were trying to make, assuming you can't answer my question. So there is case law that limits our authority to grant or deny adjustment under that law. But that is something that we will continue to consider and analyze moving forward.\nMR. RHODES: I'd just add a couple things. On the congressional point, while we did not have regular updates on what were very sensitive negotiations, we have over the course of the last year or so, frankly, heard from members of Congress, from both parties, who were expressing increasing concern about the migration flows. In fact, in some cases, we were being urged to do something about it. And we've also heard increasing interest and even pieces of legislation being introduced that seek to amend or repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act, whether it's the benefits provided under the Cuban Adjustment Act or the act itself. So this is an issue that we've discussed with members of Congress from both parties, and around this announcement of course we're doing many notifications to those interested members.\nAnd I should add to Serena's original question here -- that congressional interest is one of the things that gave us a greater impetus to act. It was clear to us that Congress was taking a greater interest in this issue, given the uptick in migration flows and the strain that that was placing on certain communities.\nOn CAA, again, the cleanest way to fully normalize is to repeal the act. So that is the -- that would be our recommendation. We have seven days, so it's not going to happen in that timeframe, but I do think actually there is bipartisan support for that type of effort going forward.\nQ: Hi, thanks for doing this call. I wanted to ask two things. One is just sort of a more technical thing. This happened by a Department of Homeland Security rule, right, so presumably in a subsequent administration, it could be undone and then the Cuban Adjustment Act is still there. I'm just wondering if for some reason this wasn't followed up on, and our Congress doesn't repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act, and the Cubans don't revise their policy with that four-year window, could we be left with the same situation sort of de facto that we have now?\nAnd then secondly, just if you guys could put this in context a bit. This was a policy initially designed to give Cubans who are fleeing persecution a special way of getting to the United States. In making this move, is the administration essentially taking the position that this is no longer necessary or appropriate, I guess, giving the dйtente?\nMR. RHODES: Jeh, you take the first question. I can handle the second.\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: It's important to remember that this is the ending of a policy that was put in place 20 years ago. This is not the enactment of a policy that can be repealed by a subsequent administration. This is us repealing a policy unique to Cuba, given the nature of the relationship 20 years ago, which is very different right now. So I wouldn't characterize it as creating a policy that could be repealed.\nGo ahead, Ben.\nMR. RHODES: Yeah, I'd just say a couple of things. I just want to clarify, Julie, because of the nature of the way you phrased it. Keep in mind that the four-year provision is not six. So, in other words, it's four years from whenever the individual leaves Cuba. So, in other words, the earliest that that could enter into question is four years from today. But if an individual leaves Cuba a year from now, that's five years from today. It is a peculiarity, but Congress will have four years to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act. During that time, we will be putting individuals who come into our custody, who have arrived here illegally, into removal proceedings. And again, the Cubans have committed to repeal their law, which was passed to be reciprocal to the Cuban Adjustment Act.\nTo your second question, I think a number of things have changed. First of all, I think as a general matter there are certainly individuals -- well, put it this way -- early in the post-revolution history, it was very clear that the overwhelming number of Cubans who came to the United States and ended up doing incredible things here in the United States absolutely had to leave for political purposes, or very much were leaving for political purposes. I think increasingly over time, the balance has tilted towards people leaving for more traditional reasons in terms of seeking economic opportunity and, frankly, having not just the benefits of \"wet foot, dry foot\" and the adjusted status, but also literal benefits under the Cuban Adjustment Act. That's not to say that they're not still people who have political cause to leave Cuba. And as we do with any other country, political asylum continues to be an option for those individuals. But we have seen the balance shift to more similar reasons in terms of people pursuing economic opportunity.\nThe second thing I'd say is that we believe that ultimately the best future for Cuba is one that is determined by the Cuban people, both in terms of their economic livelihoods and in terms of their political future. And, frankly, it's important that Cuba continue to have a young, dynamic population that are clearly serving as agents of change and becoming entrepreneurs, and being more connected to the rest of the world. And, frankly, we believe that this change is in service of creating more incentive for there to be the economic reforms that need to be pursued on the island in terms of opening up more space for the private sector, allowing foreign firms to hire Cubans, so that they can be responsive to the economic aspirations of their people.\nSo in the long run, the best way for Cubans to have this opportunity is for them to be able to pursue it at home through an economy that has continued to pursue market-based reforms.\nNow, we believe very strongly, in this administration, of course, that our Cuba opening is the best way to incentivize that economic reform; that as more Americans travel, as more Americans do business, as there are greater commercial ties, that ultimately is going to create more opportunity for people in Cuba, as well as creating opportunities for Americans. And so that's very much the approach we'd like to see continued going forward, and ultimately the one that has the best opportunity to deliver results to the Cuban people.\nThe links between Cuban Americans and Cubans will remain as robust as ever. And, in fact, what we've done is open up for space for those links, because Cuban Americans can now travel, they can send unlimited remittances. Many of them are people who are focused on -- many of the commercial opportunities include Cuban Americans who want to contribute to the building and development of Cuba. So those links will remain very strong in the context of this policy change.\nWe'll take one more question.\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: I just would like to emphasize something my colleague said a moment ago coming from me. Cuban migrants, like everybody else, will still be able to apply for asylum, consistent with our laws. So this is -- what we're doing is putting, to the full extent permitted under each nation's laws, putting Cuban migrants in the same place and on the same footing with migrants who come here from other countries who are available -- who are allowed to apply for asylum and the like. It's an effort to normalize the relationship and equalize it in the region and how we treat migrants from around the world.\nMR. RHODES: We'll take the last question.\nQ: Thank you very much. Just wanted to clarify the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border. If a Cuban approaches the border tomorrow and presents himself to immigration with a Cuban ID card and nothing more than that, in the past they've been allowed entry and parole. Will they still continue to be allowed to cross the border into the United States to apply for asylum, or will they be turned away like other people? Will they still -- in other words, will they still have some kind of privilege under the Cuban Adjustment Act that will allow them to set foot in the country to make that asylum claim?\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: The policy repeal is effective immediately. So a Cuban migrant, like a Guatemalan migrant or a migrant from El Salvador, can assert a claim of credible fear at the border when they arrive. But effective immediately, that policy -- our approach to Cubans arriving tomorrow will be the same as those arriving from other countries in Central America, Mexico, and otherwise.\nMR. RHODES: And just to put a fine point on this, the Cubans will be treated like everybody else. People from anywhere can issue a claim of asylum; that does happen frequently. This is an important point, though: Under the current policy, they would have been paroled in, and then that would have put them into a position where they could begin to receive the benefits under the Cuban Adjustment Act. They're not going to be paroled in during whatever adjudication might take place of a claim.\nSo essentially they are being treated like people from any other country that arrives. There's not going to be a separate queue for Cubans. So just like any other migrant who reaches our border, they have certain claims that they can pursue, but they'll be treated as other individuals from other countries are. And if they are not paroled in, they will not be able to adjust and achieve the benefits under the CAA, which would be the current context.\nSo I think that's an important change, particularly in light of how this issue has been debated and discussed in parts of the country -- because, again, if people knew that they could achieve that parole into the country immediately, they also know that that would put them on a track towards the potential benefits afforded to them under the CAA. That changes -- it just treats the Cuban migrants like migrants from other countries.\nMR. RHODES: Okay, thanks, everybody, for getting on the call. And we look forward to answering any other inquiries you may have going forward.\nJeh, is there anything else you want to say?\nSECRETARY JOHNSON: No, that's it.\nMR. RHODES: Great. Thanks, everybody.\nEND 6:29 P.M.

Building on the Administration's commitment to protecting places that are culturally and historically significant and that reflect the story of all Americans, today's designations will protect historic sites in Alabama and South Carolina that played an important role in American history stretching from the Civil War to the civil rights movement.\nThe new monuments are the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument, Freedom Riders National Monument and Reconstruction Era National Monument.\n•      Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument: The Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument will protect the historic A.G. Gaston Motel in Birmingham, Alabama, which served at one point as the headquarters for the civil rights campaign led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The monument will also tell the stories associated with other nearby Birmingham historic sites, including the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church— which was the site of a bombing in 1963; and Kelly Ingram Park, where Birmingham Public Safety Commissioner Bull Connor turned hoses and dogs on young civil rights protesters.\n•      Freedom Riders National Monument: The Freedom Riders National Monument is located in Anniston, Alabama and contains two sites that help underscore the Freedom Riders' importance to the civil rights movement. The monument includes the Greyhound Bus Station where a racially integrated bus of Freedom Riders attempting to test desegregation was attacked in the spring of 1961, and the site where the same bus was firebombed and burned some minutes later.\n•      Reconstruction Era National Monument: Located in coastal South Carolina, the new Reconstruction Era National Monument encompasses four sites throughout Beaufort County that tell the vibrant story of the robust community developed by freed former African American slaves in the Reconstruction Era South. This designation includes the Brick Baptist Church and Darrah Hall at the existing Penn Center on St. Helena Island as well as the Old Firehouse in downtown Beaufort and parts of Camp Saxton in Port Royal where the Emancipation Proclamation was read on New Year's Day in 1863. These sites establish the first unit of the National Park System focused on telling the story of Reconstruction.\nProtection for these sites is strongly supported by the local communities, elected officials, and a wide variety of stakeholders including civil rights organizations, environmental justice groups and historic preservation groups. Each designation was also supported by legislation introduced by members of the Alabama and South Carolina delegations.\nPromoting Diversity and Inclusivity in Managing Our Public Lands and Water\nPresident Obama is taking new steps to promote diversity and inclusivity in our nation's system of national parks, national forests, monuments and other public lands and waters. Today, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the agencies charged with managing the vast majority of America's public lands and waters — the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — to work to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to experience our great outdoors and engage in decisions about how our public lands and waters are managed. The Memorandum also directs agencies to prioritize building a more inclusive Federal workforce that is reflective of the diversity of our Nation.\nExpansion of National Monuments Protecting Natural Resources in California and Oregon\nIn addition to the new designations honoring African American history, today, President Obama is expanding two existing national monuments to protect critical biodiversity, important historic and natural resources and vital wildlife habitat in California and Oregon.\n•      Expansion of California Coastal National Monument: Today, President Obama is expanding the existing California Coastal National Monument by 6,230 acres to include six additional coastal sites proposed for protection in legislation introduced by members of the California Congressional delegation in 2015. The monument was originally designated in 2000 by President Bill Clinton and expanded by President Obama in 2014 to include Point-Arena-Stornetta in Mendocino County. Today's expansion will protect incredible coastal natural resources, scenic views, and areas of cultural and historical significance, including sites that provide insight into the Native peoples who first lived along California's coast and places still important to local tribes today.\n•      Expansion of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument: Located in southwest Oregon and northern California, the current Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument protects the significant biodiversity at the intersection of three distinct bioregions, including wildlife habitat for nearly 200 species of birds. Drawing from two different reports compiled by the scientific community as well as a legislation introduced in the Senate in 2015, today's expansion will protect more than 42,000 additional acres of public land in Oregon and approximately 5,000 acres in California to increase vital habitat connectivity, watershed protection, and landscape-scale resilience for the area's unique biological values, particularly in the face of growing impacts from climate change.", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama Designates National Monuments Honoring Civil Rights History"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123059", "text": "WTO Case Announced by USTR Builds on Strong Trade Enforcement Record\nFrom day one, President Obama and his Administration have vigorously worked to build a far more capable trade enforcement system. The result has been a strong record of enforcement victories that are helping to level the playing field for American workers and businesses. The Administration has enlisted all relevant agencies and used all the tools at its disposal to identify, monitor, enforce, and resolve the full range of international trade issues, so that American workers, farmers, and businesses receive the benefits they are due under our trade and investment agreements and to prevent American jobs from being threatened by unfair trading practices.\n•      Aggressively Pursuing — and Winning — Cases at the World Trade Organization: Today, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is launching a new trade enforcement action against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) targeting China's unfair subsidies for its aluminum industry. This is the 25th WTO challenge of this Administration and the 16th against China alone. The United States has brought more WTO challenges over the last eight years than any other country. And we've won every single one of these challenges that has been decided.\n•      Levying Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Penalties on Foreign Industries and Trading Partners at the Highest Rate in 14 Years, Particularly Important to the Steel Industry: The Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are enforcing 370 trade remedy orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports and level the playing field for American workers and businesses.\n•      In each of the last two years, Commerce initiated the largest number of new investigations in 14 years. The Administration worked with Congress to secure new legislative authorities that provide a substantial upgrade in our government's trade enforcement capabilities. Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China.\n•      Pursuing Diplomatic Engagement to Uphold Labor Rights, Protect the Environment, and Ensure Intellectual Property Rights Are Enforced:  The United States has undertaken initiatives with our free trade agreement partners to strengthen workers' rights in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, Colombia, Honduras, Jordan, Panama, and others. We have pressed our trading partners to effectively implement environmental provisions in our free trade agreements to protect the environment and prevent illegal logging. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements between the United States and more than 50 trading partners and regions around the world have facilitated discussions on enhancing intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. We also direct international initiatives to broaden awareness of IPR's important role in addressing international concerns, such as counterfeit medicines and internet piracy, so countries will investigate and prosecute cases of IPR violations.\n•      Combating Excess Capacity in Industrial Sectors: The United States led an international coalition to bring together more than thirty countries — including both G-20 members and as well as major steel-producing countries that are not in the G-20 — to form a new Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum, co-chaired by the United States, will address market distorting practices that negatively impact trade and the steel industry and workers around the world. Furthermore, we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making \"zombie enterprises,” and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.\n•      Building Stronger Enforcement Authorities and Coordination: President Obama worked with Congress to pass and sign into law two new pieces of legislation, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (also referred to as \"Customs” legislation) and the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (also referred to as the \"Level the Playing Field Act”), each of which strengthened our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. With these new authorities, Commerce, CBP, and ICE have been able to apply consequences for recalcitrant importers that persist in violating our domestic trade laws, increase on-site verification of imports, and further investigate claims of evasions of import taxes.\nThe Administration's Continued Commitment to Enforcement\nUSTR Enforcement Actions\nEnforcement at the WTO\nSince the start of his Administration, President Obama has made enforcement of our trade rights a top priority. To that end, since 2009, the United States has filed 25 enforcement actions at the WTO, more than any other WTO Member over that period. And the United States has won every single one of those challenges decided thus far, including seven against China alone. Export figures confirm that these enforcement victories are worth billions of dollars for American farmers and ranchers; manufacturers of high-tech steel, aircraft, and automobiles; solar energy exporters; cutting edge service providers; and many others. To ensure the greatest economic benefits for American workers and exporters, the Administration continues to use our trade enforcement actions to emphasize opening large, strategic markets to which we can export a diverse array of Made-in-America products and services. Recent examples include:\n•      Indonesia agricultural import barriers victory: In December 2016, a WTO panel sided with the United States on all claims regarding Indonesia's restrictive import barriers for horticultural products, animals, and animal products. The United States successfully challenged 18 Indonesian measures because they restricted or prohibited the importation of fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Elimination of these restrictions could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in increased U.S. agriculture exports to Indonesia every year.\n•      China administration of agricultural TRQs: In December 2016, USTR launched a WTO action against China targeting its administration of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for rice, wheat, and corn. China's TRQs permit set volumes of rice, wheat, and corn to enter China at a low duty rate. However, China's administration of these TRQs is not transparent, predictable, or fair, and China's TRQ administration restricts imports. This challenge will ensure China lives up to its WTO commitments to provide meaningful market access to U.S. grain exports.\n•      China discriminatory aircraft tax exemptions: In October 2016, USTR announced that the United States had confirmed China's ending of discriminatory tax exemptions that had benefited certain aircraft produced in China. This announcement followed USTR's December 2015 launch of a WTO action against these discriminatory measures that covered a wide range of domestically produced aircraft, including general aviation and regional and business jets. Through this action, the United States challenged China's breaches of fundamental WTO rules of non-discrimination and transparency in this strategically important sector.\n•      India solar localization victory: In September 2016, the WTO Appellate Body agreed with a previous panel report finding that India's \"localization” rules discriminate against U.S. solar cells and modules by requiring use of Indian products. American solar exports to India dropped 90 percent after the prohibited requirements took effect, and this victory will eliminate discrimination against American solar exports in a roughly $1 billion market.\n•      European aircraft subsidies victory: In September 2016, a WTO compliance panel issued a report finding that the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom continue to breach WTO rules through subsidies the WTO previously found to have caused adverse effects to the United States. The compliance panel also found that these European governments further breached WTO rules by granting more than $4 billion in new subsidized financing for the A350 XWB which was causing tens of billions of dollars in additional adverse effects to U.S. industry.\n•      China agricultural government support: In September 2016, USTR launched a new WTO enforcement action against China's excessive support for farmers. In 2015, the level of support provided by China through its \"market price support” programs for rice, wheat, and corn was nearly $100 billion in excess of China's WTO commitments. By setting prices for rice, wheat, and corn well above market levels, China encourages overproduction by its farmers, disadvantaging U.S. farmers seeking export opportunities in China.\n•      China raw materials restrictions: In July 2016, USTR initiated a dispute at the WTO against China's export duties and quotas on various forms of nine different raw materials. These raw materials are key inputs into a variety of Made-in-America products from a range of sectors, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemicals, and more.\n•      China demonstration bases agreement: In April 2016, following a challenge by the United States at the WTO, China agreed to dismantle its prohibited export subsidies under the \"Demonstration Bases-Common Service Platform” program. The agreement represented a win for American workers employed in seven diverse export sectors, including agriculture, textiles, and medical products, who will benefit from a more level playing field on which to compete.\n•      China poultry compliance challenge: In May 2016, the United States challenged China at the WTO following China's failure to bring its AD/CVD orders against imports of U.S. chicken broiler products into compliance with WTO rules. The United States challenged the Chinese-imposed duties on behalf of American poultry producers and the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the poultry industry. The United States remains firmly committed to ensuring that China lives up to its WTO obligations, and that American farmers and workers can compete and win on a level playing field in the global economy.\n•      China high-tech steel duties: In July 2015, the United States prevailed in a WTO challenge to China's compliance actions following WTO findings in 2012 that China's duties on high-tech steel were inconsistent with WTO rules. Those WTO-inconsistent duties contributed to over $250 million in annual export losses for American steel exporters. The U.S. compliance challenge was the first time any WTO member had initiated a WTO proceeding to challenge a claim by China that it had complied with adverse WTO findings. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.\n•      India agricultural bans: In June 2015, the WTO sided with the United States in a dispute challenging India's ban on U.S. agricultural products such as poultry meat, eggs, and live pigs, agreeing that India's measures represented unscientific and discriminatory restrictions. The decision affirmed that countries' avian influenza restrictions must be grounded in science, such as by taking into account the limited geographic impact from outbreaks, and not be simply a disguise for protectionism.\n•      Argentina import licensing restrictions: In January 2015, the United States won a trade enforcement victory against Argentina that involved its widespread restrictions on the importation of a range of U.S. goods. The restrictions by Argentina affected billions of dollars in U.S. exports, including energy products, electronics and machinery, aero-space and parts, pharmaceuticals, precious instruments and medical devices, miscellaneous chemicals, motor vehicles, vehicle parts, and agricultural products.\n•      China SUV / automobile duties: In June 2014, the WTO found that China breached WTO rules by imposing unjustified extra duties on American cars and sport utility vehicles. In 2013, an estimated $5.1 billion of U.S. auto exports were covered by those duties. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.\nOther Enforcement Actions. In addition to these successes at the WTO, we have taken a wide range of additional enforcement action to protect the environment, ensure the protection of intellectual property, and protect labor rights so that American workers compete on a level playing field.\n•      Peru timber verification: In February 2016, the United States made the first timber verification request under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). In August 2016, the United States issued a statement reviewing the overall findings of the government of Peru's verification report and identified additional areas of progress for Peru. The request serves as an important assessment tool to help ensure that Peruvian forestry laws are enforced throughout the supply chain, and that timber imported into the United States is legally harvested and exported.\n•      South Africa agriculture export settlement: The United States and South Africa negotiated the removal of long-standing barriers to U.S. agricultural products entering South Africa. The removal of these unfair barriers ensured American poultry, pork, and beef farmers access to an important market, while providing South African consumers with an opportunity to buy and enjoy high-quality American agricultural products.\n•      Honduras IPR enforcement: In March 2016, the United States announced Honduras' commitment to undertake a series of actions to strengthen the protection and enforcement of intellectual property in Honduras. The new commitment followed USTR's Out-of-Cycle Review of intellectual property protection in Honduras under the Special 301 report, and will benefit American agriculture, creative industries, telecommunications, textiles and apparel, and other U.S. exports.\n•      Colombia labor steps: USTR and the Department of Labor worked with the government of Colombia on a Presidential Decree, issued in April 2016, to help inspectors investigate and apply potentially very significant fines to employers that use abusive forms of subcontracting to violate labor rights. With robust enforcement, this decree could have a significant impact on the ground for workers and address a main concern related to protection of workers' rights in Colombia.\n•      NTE report: In March 2016, USTR released the National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) report, which represents a key component in the Administration's unprecedented trade enforcement efforts. The report serves as a guide to trade barriers being imposed across the globe, and the work President Obama has done to build a more capable enforcement system that utilizes resources from agencies across the government.\n•      Special 301 report: In April 2016, the Obama Administration unveiled its 2016 Special 301 Report, which provides an overview on the global state of intellectual property rights and enforcement, and lists the most significant challenges facing American intellectual property creators and holders.\nCommerce AD/CVD Actions and Trade Agreements Compliance\nCommerce, CBP, and ICE are currently enforcing 370 antidumping (AD) / countervailing duty (CVD) orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports. Of these orders, 184 involve imports of steel and steel-related products, representing nearly half of all orders currently in effect. AD/CVD orders are an effective tool for providing relief to U.S. companies and workers injured by unfair trade practices and allowing American companies to compete on a fairer and more level playing field. This year, Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, including on cold-rolled, hot-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel products, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China. Following affirmative determinations of material injury by the U.S. International Trade Commission, Commerce puts into place AD/CVD orders. The results of these AD/CVD investigations and orders are already having a positive impact on American workers. Recent examples include:\n•      Non-Oriented Electrical Steel. In October 2014, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Sweden, and Taiwan and final affirmative CVD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China and Taiwan. Final CVD rates are as high as 158 percent for imports from China and AD rates are as high as 407 percent for imports from China.\n•      Corrosion-Resistant Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on corrosion-resistant steel imports from China, India, Italy, and Korea, as well as an AD order on corrosion-resistant steel products from Taiwan. AD duties as high as 210 percent and CV duties as high as 241 percent were calculated for imports from China.\n•      Cold-Rolled Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from China, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from Japan. In September 2016, Commerce issued further AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from Brazil, India, and South Korea, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from the United Kingdom. Commerce imposed final AD duties as high as 265 percent for China and final CV duties as high as 265 percent for China.\n•      Hot-Rolled Steel. In October 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Brazil and South Korea, and AD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. AD duties are as high as 33 percent for imports from the United Kingdom and final CV duties are as high as 57 percent for imports from Korea.\n•      Cut-To-Length Plate. In November 2016, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey. AD duties were as high as 94 percent for imports from South Africa. Commerce is in the process of conducting additional investigations with regard to cut-to-length plate. In September 2016, Commerce issued an affirmative preliminary CVD determination with regard to cut-to-length plate from China with preliminary CVD duties of 210 percent for all imports from China. In November 2016, Commerce issued preliminary affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Austria, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with AD duties as high as 131 percent for imports from Italy. Commerce is scheduled to issue its pending final determinations by the end of March 2017.\nCommerce also administers a variety of programs and has offices to monitor trade agreement operation, and identify and address foreign government non-compliance with trade agreement obligations. Commerce operates the Trade Agreements Compliance Program, which deals with non-tariff barriers that affect U.S. businesses operating abroad; monitors foreign AD/CVD actions against U.S. firms, advocating on their behalf to preserve fair access to key markets; and tracks and advocates against foreign government subsidy practices that distort trade and unbalance the playing field for U.S. companies. In 2016, Commerce successfully resolved more than 30 foreign non-tariff barrier trade compliance cases with a total combined value of more than $14 billion in exports safeguarded. Commerce's advocacy efforts also helped bring about the successful termination of 26 foreign trade remedy proceedings in 2016, affecting approximately $373 million in U.S. exports.\nGiven the importance of these matters, Commerce is establishing an  Advisory Council on Trade Enforcement and Compliance (ACTEC) to directly advise the Secretary of Commerce on laws and government policies that deal with trade enforcement; identify and recommend programs, policies, and actions to help Commerce in its efforts to ensure that U.S. trading partners comply with their trade agreement commitments; and recommend ways that Commerce's trade enforcement and compliance policies and programs can better support a strong trade and manufacturing agenda and enhance the commercial competitiveness of the United States.\nStepping up U.S. Customs and Border Protection Efforts on Steel\nCBP has worked alongside partners across the U.S. government to ensure that our trade laws are strictly enforced. CBP personnel work tirelessly at the 328 ports of entry and throughout the world to prevent shipments of unfairly traded goods from entering U.S. commerce, including steel that is being dumped on our markets or is unfairly subsidized and products that infringe upon U.S. intellectual property rights. In doing so, CBP defends the U.S. economy from unfair competition and the theft of American innovation and protects people who live and work in the United States from health and public safety risks posed by counterfeit goods. CBP continues to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure they have all the information they need to lawfully import and export their goods.\n•      CBP recently identified approximately $7 million in AD/CVD discrepancies on Chinese steel plate shipments, and raised continuous bond amounts for three steel importers.\n•      Additionally, CBP's Operation Flatline recovered over $800,000 in AD/CVD duties on imports of corrosion-resistant, flat-rolled steel products from China.\n•      CBP's Trade Enforcement Task Force has collected over $1.5 million in unpaid AD/CVD duties on steel imports.\n•      CBP has implemented a targeted approach to increase reviews of steel imports, which will provide a measure of the risk presented by steel imports, and identify targets for further enforcement.\n•      CBP is requiring \"live entry” for certain high-risk steel imports, meaning that all entry documents and duties are required to be provided before cargo is released by CBP into U.S. commerce.\n•      CBP is partnering with the steel industry to deliver seminars for CBP, other U.S. government trade personnel (including Commerce and ICE), and customs brokers to provide participants with knowledge of industry operations and enhance understanding of how AD/CVD enforcement can best be implemented in the current trade environment. In Fiscal Year 2016, CBP and the U.S. steel industry conducted Steel Seminars in Laredo, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Long Beach, California; and most recently, in Detroit, Michigan. These seminars are scheduled to resume in early 2017 in Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Mobile, Alabama; Newark, New Jersey; and Seattle, Washington.\n•      CBP's Base Metals Center of Excellence and Expertise for trade enforcement, which is specifically focused on the steel sector, is now fully operational, where CBP's industry experts work together to focus on outreach, targeting, and enforcement of steel imports.\n•      CBP Laboratories and Scientific Services is directing funds to its network of laboratories, where CBP's forensic and scientific arm uses state-of-the-art techniques to identify AD/CVD evasion.\nBuilding International Pressure to Address Excess Capacity\nWe have made clear to our trading partners — in particular, China — that excess capacity in the steel, aluminum, and other industrial sectors is harmful to American manufacturers and an unsustainable drag on the global economy and that all major steel-producing nations must be committed to working together to eliminate policies that contribute to excess capacity, particularly in the steel industry.\nOver two years, we have engaged through bilateral mechanisms such as the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) and the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) to press China to address industrial excess capacity. In February 2015, China publicly announced plans to reduce steelmaking capacity by 100 to 150 million metric tons over five years. At the S&ED meeting in June 2016, excess capacity was a key economic priority, and we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making \"zombie enterprises,” and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.\nWe have built a robust coalition of like-minded trading partners who share our concerns regarding excess capacity and are committed to addressing this issue. At the end of May 2016, G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel. And on June 29, 2016, North American Leaders announced broad customs cooperation to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments.\nOn September 4-5, 2016, these steps contributed to President Obama's successful efforts to secure a commitment from the Leaders of the G-20, which also represents the world's largest steel producers, to establish a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum is designed to help lead to a reduction in global excess steel capacity and production through the identification of market-distorting policies that sustain excess capacity, actions to make net reductions in capacity, and monitoring and accountability mechanisms. In addition, at their summit meeting on September 5, 2016, President Obama and Chinese President Xi recognized that excess capacity was a global issue requiring collective responses, and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement changes to its bankruptcy practice to facilitate market exit of failing firms and further improving its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.\nConsistent and concerted international engagement over 2016 yielded these milestones:\n•      Launch of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, December 16: More than thirty G-20 and other steel-producing countries put the Global Forum into action by approving Terms of Reference, and convening the first Forum meeting in Berlin, Germany. The United States, China, and Germany were selected as co-chairs of the Forum for 2017. The Forum will report the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017 and annually thereafter. The Forum's establishment demonstrates a commitment to identify and resolve market-distorting practices that sustain excess capacity, creating a negative impact on trade, the steel industry, and workers around the world.\n•      Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, November 23:The United States and China committed to exchange information and work together to address global aluminum excess capacity. The United States and China also agreed to hold a U.S.-China Steel Dialogue in 2017.\n•      WTO Subsidies Committee, October: The United States with the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Mexico co-sponsored a paper on the problem of subsidies and overcapacity in certain sectors (e.g., steel and aluminum) and submitted it for consideration by the WTO Subsidies Committee. The submission proposed that the Subsidies Committee examine the extent to which subsidies contribute to overcapacity and how such subsidies could be further disciplined.\n•      U.S.-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit, September 8:ASEAN countries recognized excess capacity as a global problem and welcomed the formation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity envisioned by the G-20 and pledged to actively support its work.\n•      OECD Steel Committee Meeting, September 8: The United States actively participated in an exchange of information regarding regional and global steel market developments and steelmaking capacity developments, to carry out a work program that increases transparency of steelmaking capacity data.\n•      G-20 Leaders Meeting, September 4-5: Leaders committed to take effective steps to address the challenges of excess capacity in steel and other industries so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustment. Leaders also called for increased information sharing and cooperation through the formation of a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, to be facilitated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the active participation of G-20 members and interested OECD members. This Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity would report on progress to the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017.\n•      U.S.-China Leaders Meeting, September 3: President Obama met with Chinese President Xi to emphasize U.S. concerns regarding excess capacity in steel, aluminum, and other industries. Both leaders recognized that excess capacity is a global issue which requires collective responses and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement bankruptcy laws and further improve its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.\n•      G-20 Trade Ministers Meeting, July 9-10 and G-20 Finance Ministers Meeting, July 23-24: Trade and Finance Ministers committed to enhanced communication, cooperation, and effective steps to address the challenges surrounding excess capacity, including participation in the OECD Steel Committee.\n•      North American Leaders Summit, June 29: The United States, Canada, and Mexico announced efforts to address government policies that distort the steel and aluminum sectors and contribute to excess capacity and announced that our customs agencies would work together to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments of steel and other industrial goods.\n•      U.S. China Strategic & Economic Dialogue, June 6-7: The United States secured China's commitment to, among other things, strictly contain steel capacity expansion, reduce net steel capacity, eliminate outdated steel capacity, and dispose of \"zombie enterprises” through restructuring, bankruptcy, and liquidation, as appropriate.\n•      OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, June 1-2: The United States and partners issued statements recognizing the negative impact on trade of global excess capacity in sectors such as steel and shipbuilding, and stressed the need to avoid market-distorting measures and to enhance well-functioning markets.\n•      G-7 Leaders Meeting, May 26-27: G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel.\n•      Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade Steel Dialogue with China, May 11-12: U.S. senior officials, with full participation of steel industry representatives and the United Steelworkers, held a dialogue with senior Chinese government and industry officials to emphasize America's serious concerns about excess capacity and injurious trade.\n•      Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) High-Level Meeting on Excess Capacity and Structural Adjustment in the Steel Sector, April 18-19: The United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, and others joined together to call for specific steps to address steel excess capacity and to urge the formation of a Global Forum facilitated by the OECD.\n•      North American Steel Trade Committee, March 31 — April 1: The United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed on the need for all major steel-producing countries to make strong and immediate commitments to address the problem of global excess steelmaking capacity.\nCommerce and USTR organized a public hearing on April 12-13, 2016 to solicit a range of views about excess capacity to inform U.S. engagement with its trading partners, to identify solutions to address the steel crisis, and to hear the concerns of our steelworkers and industry. The request for public comment generated 100 submissions and 43 requests to testify. Among those testifying were twelve Members of Congress, the President of the United Steelworkers, a range of company CEOs and COOs, and five steelworkers' associations. Secretary Pritzker and Ambassador Froman each attended sessions with representatives from CBP, Treasury, Labor, and State.\nIn August 2016, Commerce announced the release of a series of reports detailing current steel trade flows involving the top importing and exporting countries. The enhanced global steel trade monitor reports provide U.S. business with updated market intelligence about global steel trade flows.\nBolstering Trade Enforcement Tools\nOn February 24, 2016, President Obama signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Customs bill). Coupled with the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (Level the Playing Field Act),  signed by President Obama on June 29, 2015, the Customs bill strengthens our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. Relevant agencies across the U.S. government have followed through by fully implementing the authorities in ways that have produced results.\n•      Implementation of the Customs bill:\no       Commerce now requires foreign exporters who claim to be \"new shippers” to post actual estimated duties rather than bonds during the pendency of reviews to determine the validity of their new shipper claims, and has increased its scrutiny of exporters claiming to be \"new shippers” in AD/CVD proceedings.\no       Commerce has also increased the number of on-site verifications of the information provided by these so-called \"new shippers,” and has found many of the sales reported by these exporters to not be genuine. As a result, imports from many of these exporters are subject to higher AD/CVD rates.\no       On August 22, 2016, CBP published an interim final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately, implementing additional procedures for investigating claims of evasion of AD/CVD orders pursuant to Title IV of the Act, commonly referred to as the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015, or EAPA. This strengthens CBP's enforcement efforts by establishing an additional method for submitting and investigating allegations of AD/CVD evasion against U.S. importers.\no       CBP established an interagency Trade Enforcement Task Force that enables CBP to leverage new enforcement authorities and harness the agency's trade enforcement expertise as a focal point for coordination with other government agency partners, including Commerce, Department of Justice, and ICE.\no       CBP established an Enforce Act team to operationalize the new mandatory AD/CVD evasion investigative procedures. This includes internal operating procedures, updating CBP's e-Allegations website, and drafting regulations.\no       CBP has issued four withhold release orders — which hold shipments in port — for shipment of goods made with prohibitive forms of forced labor and conducted various outreach events on implementation with various stakeholder groups including trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations.\no       ICE has held over 30 information sessions on trade investigations relating to forced labor allegations to audiences such as trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations. In addition, ICE has held five media interviews on this same subject, all of which resulted in media postings in both print and online media.\no       In 2016, the Small Business Administration integrated requirements in the law into the administration of the State Trade Expansion Program and issued matching-grant awards pursuant to the terms in the legislation.\n•      CBP AD/CVD Enforcement:\no       In FY 2016, $14 billion of imported goods were subject to AD/CVD, and CBP collected $1.5 billion in AD/CVD cash deposits, which has increased over 25 percent since FY 2015, and by almost 200 percent since FY 2014.\no       CBP levied monetary penalties totaling over $30.6 million on importers for fraud, gross negligence, and negligence for AD/CVD violations under 19 U.S.C. § 1592.\no       CBP and ICE seized shipments with a domestic value of more than $5.3 million for violations of AD/CVD.\n•      Implementation of Level the Playing Field Act:\no       Application of Level the Playing Field is already strengthening enforcement of the AD/CVD laws by ensuring consequences for non-cooperating parties, mandating the collection of cost of production data, and providing a firm legal basis for rejecting input values that are dumped or subsidized.\n•      The President's FY 2017 budget requests:\no       $606 million for CBP trade administration activities and 3,816 full time staff to implement this work.\no       $84 million for the Commerce Enforcement and Compliance Program, a $4.5 million increase over the 2016 enacted level. This includes 347 full-time staff.\no       Annualizes the 38 additional positions funded by Congress in FY 2016 — a 10 percent increase in Commerce's enforcement staffing to address the urgent need for additional staffing caused by the sustained and significant increase in AD/CVD cases.", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Fact Sheet: The Obama Administration's Record on the Trade Enforcement"}

Hey! Joe Biden. All right, that's enough. Don't want to embarrass the guy. [Laughter]\nWelcome to the White House, everybody. As I have already delivered my Farewell Address, I will try to be relatively brief. [Laughter] But I just wanted to get some folks together to pay tribute to somebody who has not only been by my side for the duration of this amazing journey, but somebody who has devoted his entire professional life to service to this country, the best Vice President America has ever had, Mr. Joe Biden. [Applause] Hey!\nThis also gives the Internet one last chance to talk about our bromance. [Laughter] This has been quite a ride. It was 8½ years ago that I chose Joe to be my Vice President. There has not been a single moment since that time that I've doubted the wisdom of that decision. He was the best possible choice, not just for me, but for the American people. This is an extraordinary man with an extraordinary career in public service. This is somebody the people of Delaware sent to the Senate as quickly as they possibly could. [Laughter]\nElected at age 29, for more than a dozen years apiece, he served as chair or ranking member of the Judiciary and Foreign Relation Committees. Domestically, he championed landmark legislation to make our communities safer, to protect our women from violence. Internationally, his wisdom and capacity to build relationships has shaped our Nation's response to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, to counterterrorism, Iraq, Afghanistan.\nAnd for the past 8 years, he could not have been a more devoted or effective partner in the progress that we've made. He fought to make college more affordable and revitalize American manufacturing as the head of our Middle Class Task Force. He suited up for our Cancer Moonshot, giving hope to millions of Americans touched by this disease.\nHe led our efforts to combat gun violence, and he rooted out any possible misappropriations that might have occurred. And as a consequence, the Recovery Act worked as well as just about any large-scale stimulus project has ever worked in this country. He visited college after college and made friends with Lady Gaga—[laughter]—for our \"It's On Us\" campaign against campus sexual assault. And when the Pope visited, Joe was even kind enough to let me talk to the Holiness as well. [Laughter]\nBehind the scenes, Joe's candid, honest counsel has made me a better President and a better Commander in Chief. From the Situation Room to our weekly lunches, to our huddles after everybody else has cleared out of the room, he's been unafraid to give it to me straight, even if we disagree, in fact, especially when we disagree.\nAnd all of this makes him, I believe, the finest Vice President we have ever seen. And I also think he has been a lion of American history. The best part is, he's nowhere close to finished. In the years ahead, as a citizen, he will continue to build on that legacy, internationally and domestically. He's got a voice of vision and reason and optimism and love for people. And we're going to need that spirit and that vision as we continue to try to make our world safer and to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot in this country. So, all told, that's a pretty remarkable legacy, an amazing career in public service. It is, as Joe once said, a big deal. [Laughter] It is.\nBut we all know that, on its own, his work—this list of accomplishments, the amazing résumé—does not capture the full measure of Joe Biden. I have not mentioned Amtrak yet or aviators. [Laughter] Literally. [Laughter]\nVice President Biden. Oh, God!\nThe President. Folks don't just feel like they know Joe the politician, they feel like they know the person: what makes him laugh, what he believes, what he cares about, and where he came from. Pretty much every time he speaks, he treats us to some wisdom from the nuns who taught him in grade school—[laughter]—or an old Senate colleague.\nBut of course, more frequently cited—Catherine and Joseph, Sr., his mom and dad: \"No one's better than you, but you're better than nobody.\" [Laughter] \"Bravery resides in every heart, and yours is fierce and clear.\" \"And when you get knocked down, Joey, get up. Get up.\" [Laughter] \"Get up.\"\nThat's where he got those broad shoulders. That's where he got that Biden heart. And through his life, through trial after trial, he has never once forgotten the values and the moral fiber that made him who he is. That's what steels his faith in God, and in America, and in his friends, and in all of us.\nWhen Joe talks to autoworkers whose livelihoods he helped save, we hear the son of a man who once knew the pain of having to tell his kids that he had lost his job. When Joe talks about hope and opportunity for our children, we hear the father who rode the rails home every night so that he could be there to tuck his kids into bed. When Joe sticks up for the little guy, we hear the young boy who used to stand in front of the mirror, reciting Yeats or Emerson, studying the muscles in his face, determined to vanquish a debilitating stutter. When Joe talks to Gold Star families who have lost a hero, we hear a kindred spirit: another father of an American veteran, somebody whose faith has been tested and who has been forced to wander through the darkness himself and who knows who to lean on to find the light.\nSo that's Joe Biden: a resilient and loyal and humble servant and a patriot. But most of all, a family man. Starts with Jill, captain of the Vice Squad. [Laughter] The—only the Second Lady in our history to keep her regular day job. Jill says, teaching isn't what she does, it's who she is. A few days after Joe and I were inaugurated in 2009, she was back in the classroom teaching. That's why when our administration worked to strengthen community colleges, we looked to Jill to lead the way.\nShe's also traveled the world to boost education and empowerment for women. And as a Blue Star mom, her work with Michelle to honor our military families will go down in history as one of the most lasting and powerful efforts of this administration.\nOf course, like Joe, Jill's work is only part of the story. She just seems to walk this Earth so lightly, spreads her joy so freely. And she reminds us that although we're in a serious business, we don't have to take ourselves too seriously. She's quick with a laugh or a practical joke, disguising herself as a server at a party she once hosted—[laughter]—to liven the mood. She once hid in the overhead compartment of Air Force Two to scare the senior staff. [Laughter] Because why not? She seems to have a sixth sense of when to send a note of encouragement to a friend or a staffer, a simple thank you or a box of macaroons. She is one of the best, most genuine people that I've met not just in politics, but in my entire life. She is grounded and caring and generous and funny, and that's why Joe is proud to introduce himself as \"Jill Biden's husband.\" [Laughter]\nAnd to see them together is to see what real love looks like, through thick and thin, good times and bad. It's an all-American love story. And Jill once surprised Joe by painting hearts on his office windows for Valentine's Day.\nAnd then, there are these Biden kids and grandkids. They're everywhere. [Laughter] They're all good looking. [Laughter] Hunter and Ashley, who lived out that family creed of raising good families and looking out for the least of our brothers and sisters. Beau, who is watching over us with those broad shoulders and mighty heart himself, a man who left a beautiful legacy and inspired an entire nation. Naomi and Finn and Maisy and Natalie and little Hunter, grandchildren who are the light of Joe's eyes and gives him an excuse to bust out the squirt gun around the pool. [Laughter] This is the kind of family that built this country.\nThat's why my family is so proud to call ourselves honorary Bidens. [Laughter] As Yeats put it—because I had to quote an Irish poet and Seamus Heaney was taken—[laughter]—\"Think where man's glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such friends.\"\nAway from the camera, Jill and Michelle have each other's backs just as much as when they're out championing our troops. Our girls are close, best friends at school, inviting each other for vacations and sleepovers. Even though our terms are nearly over, one of the greatest gifts of these past 8 years is that we're forever bonded as a family.\nBut of course, I know that the Obamas are not the only ones who feel like they're part of the Biden clan, because Joe's heart has radiated around this room. You see it in the enduring friendships he's forged with folks of every stripe and background up on Capitol Hill. You see it in the way that his eyes light up when he finds somebody in a rope line from Scranton. [Laughter] Or just the tiniest towns in Delaware. [Laughter] You see it in the incredible loyalty of his staff, the team who knows that family always comes before work because Joe tells them so every day, the team that reflects their boss's humble service. Here in this building, where there have been no turf wars between our staffs because everybody here has understood that we were all on the same mission and shared the same values, there has just been cooperation and camaraderie. And that is rare. It's a testament to Joe and the tone that he's set.\nAnd finally, you see Joe's heart in the way he consoles families dealing with cancer backstage after an event, when he meets kids fighting through a stutter of their own; he gives them his private phone number and keeps in touch with them long after. To know Joe Biden is to know that love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully.\nAs one of his long-time colleagues in the Senate, who happened to be a Republican, once said: \"If you can't admire Joe Biden as a person, you've got a problem. [Laughter] He's as good a man as God ever created.\"\nSo, Joe, for your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country, and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I'd like to ask the Military Aide to join us on stage.\nFor the final time as President, I am pleased to award our Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And for the first and only time in my Presidency, I will bestow this medal with an additional level of veneration, an honor my three most recent successors reserved for only three others: Pope John Paul II, President Ronald Reagan, and General Colin Powell.\nLadies and gentlemen, I am proud to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with distinction to my brother, Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr.\nWill the Aide please read the citation.\n[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Ginny R. Nadolny, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal, assisted by Maj. Christopher J. Ross, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President.]\nVice President Biden. Mr. President. Please, please, thank you. Thank you. Please. Thank you.\nRicchetti, you're fired. [Laughter] For the press, Ricchetti is my Chief of Staff. [Laughter]\nI had no inkling. I thought we were coming over, Michelle, to—for you, Jill, and Barack and I and a couple of senior staff to toast one another and say what an incredible journey it's been.\nMr. President, you got right the part about my leaning on Jill. But I've also leaned on you and a lot of people in this room. I look around the room and I see great friends like Ted Kaufman, whose been of so much wisdom. Guys like Mel Monzack. I look around here and I'm startled. I keep seeing people I don't expect. Madam President, how are you? Mr. President, look at my new boss over there. [Laughter]\nBut you know, I get a lot of credit I don't deserve, to state the obvious, and because I've always had somebody to lean on. From back that time in 1972, when the accident happened, I leaned on and I mean this in a literal sense—Chris knows this, Dodd knows this, and Mel knows this, and Ted knows this—I leaned on my sons Beau and Hunter. And I continue to lean on Hunter, who continues to in a bizarre kind of way raise me. I mean, I've leaned on them.\nAnd, Mr. President, you observed early on that when either one of my boys would walk in the room, they'd walk up and say: \"Dad, what can I get you? Dad, what do you need?\"\nAnd then, Jill came along and she saved our lives. She—no man deserves one great love, let alone two. And—but everybody knows here, I am Jill's husband. Everybody knows that I love her more than she loves me—[laughter]—with good reason. [Laughter] And she gave me the most precious gift, the love of my life, the life of my love, my daughter Ashley.\nAnd I continue to lean on the family. President, you kidded me once. You heard that in the preparation for the two debates, Vice Presidential debates that I had—I only had two—that Beau and Hunt would be the last people in the room. And Beau would say: \"Look at me, Dad. Look at me. Remember, remember home base. Remember.\"\nSo—and the Secret Service can tell you, Mr. President, that Beau and Hunt and Ashley continue to have to corral me. We were at one of the national parks, and I was climbing up on top of a bridge to jump off the bridge with a bunch of young kids. And I hear my sons yelling: \"Dad, get down. Now!\" [Laughter] And I just started laughing so hard I couldn't stop. And I said, \"I was just going to do a flip—a full gainer—off here.\"\nHe said: \"Dad, the Secret Service doesn't want you up there. Dad. Look at me, Dad.\" [Laughter] So we've never figured out who the father is in this family. [Laughter] And, Mr. President, you know that with good reason there is no power in the Vice Presidency. Matter of fact, I just did for Nancy Pelosi's daughter a reading of the Constitution. You probably did one for her. And they had me read the provisions relating to the Vice Presidency in the Constitution. And there is no inherent power nor should there be.\nBut, Mr. President, you have more than kept the—your commitment to me by saying that you wanted me to help govern. The President's line often—other people don't hear it that often—but when someone would say, \"Can you get Joe to do such and such?\" he says, \"I don't do his schedule, and he doesn't do mine.\"\nEvery single thing you've asked me to do, Mr. President, you have trusted me to do. And that is a—that's a remarkable thing. I don't think according to—I see the President of Georgetown here as well. I don't think according to the Presidential, Vice Presidential scholars that kind of relationship has existed. I mean, for real. And it's all you, Mr. President. It's all you.\nThe reason why when you send me around the world, nothing gets—as my mom would say, gets missed between the cup and the lip. It's because they know when I speak, I speak for you.\nAnd it's been easy, Mr. President, because we not only have the same political philosophy and ideology. I tell everybody, and I've told them from the beginning. And I'm not saying this to reciprocate. I've never known a President and few people I've ever met my whole life—I can count on less than one hand—who have had the integrity and the decency and the sense of other people's needs like you do.\nI know you were upset when I told the story about when Hunt and I were worried that Beau would have to—that he would, as a matter of honor, decide he had to step down as attorney general while he was fighting his battle because he had aphasia. He was losing his ability to speak, and he didn't want to ever be in a position where—to him everything was about duty and honor.\nAnd I said, \"And he may resign. I don't know I just have the feeling he may.\" And Hunt and I had talked about this. And I said, \"He doesn't have any other income, but we're all right, because Hunt's there, and I can sell the house.\" We were having a private lunch like we do once a week. And this man got up, came over, grabbed me by the shoulders, looked me in the eye, and said: \"Don't you sell that house. You love that house.\" I said, \"It's no big deal, Mr. President.\" He said: \"I'll give you the money. We'll give you the money. Promise me, promise me, you won't sell that house.\"\nI remember when Ashley, Mr. President, we were in the Oval, and Ashley was in an elevator, and the elevator plummeted to the—she was with a group of people—I don't know if was just—I forget which building in Philadelphia, and it plummeted to the ground. And immediately, the Service was worried that she may have been badly hurt. And I got up to take the call, and you didn't let up until you made sure your Service followed through and made sure everything was all right.\nBut you know, Mr. President, we kid about both—about marrying up. We both did that kind of thing. But the truth of the matter is—I said this to Michelle last night—Michelle is the finest First Lady in my view that has ever served in the office. There's been other great First Ladies, but I really genuinely mean it. And—[applause]—I mean it. I kid—[applause].\nWhen I got to meet Michelle's brother, and he told me about how you guys were raised, and I got to know and love your mom. If your mom—were your mom 15 years older, she could\nhave been my mom. I mean, literally, the way you were raised, the way we were raised; there wasn't any difference. And I knew that this decision to join you, which was the greatest honor of my life, was the right decision on the night we had to go and accept the nomination, the formal—we'd be nominated at the convention. And Finnegan, who is now 18 years old, was then 10 years old. And she came to me, and she said, \"Pop, is it okay if the room that we're in\"—Finnegan, Maisy, and Naomi—\"that we have the beds taken out?\" And I said, \"Why?\" She said, maybe the Obama girls and your brother's children, maybe they would come down, all sleep together in sleeping bags. [Laughter] And I give you my word as a Biden, I knew when I left to go to the convention, open that door, and saw them cuddled together—[laughter]—I knew this was the right decision. I knew it was the right decision. I really did. Because, Mr. President, the same values set. The same values set.\nFolks, you know, I joke with my staff that I don't know why they pay them anything, because they get to advise me. [Laughter] Let me explain what I mean by that. As the President of the University of Delaware, where my heart resides, and my home campus of Delaware, as he can tell you, it's—I get to give you advice. I get to be the last guy in the room and give you advice on the most difficult decisions anyone has to make in the whole world. But I get to walk out, and you make it all by yourself. All by yourself.\nHarry Truman was right about the buck stopping at the desk. And I've never, never, never once doubted on these life-and-death decisions. I never once doubted that your judgment was flawed, not once. Not once.\nAnd we've disagreed, and we've argued, and we've raised our voices, one of which we made a deal we'd be completely open like brothers with one another. But, Mr. President, I watched you under intense fire. I will venture to say that no President in history has had as many novel crises land on his desk in all of history. The Civil War was worse, the World War II was worse, World War I, but, Mr. President, almost every one of the crises you faced was a case of first instance. A case of first instance. And I watched that prodigious mind and that heart as big as your head—I've watched you. I've watched how you've acted.\nWhen you see a woman or man under intense pressure, you get a measure, and you know that, Michelle, and your daughters know it as well. This is a remarkable man. And I just hope that the asterisk in history that is attached to my name when they talk about this Presidency is that I can say I was part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country. Remarkable things.\nThe President. This is supposed to be for you.\nVice President Biden. Thank you!\nYou know, I can't let a comment go by without quoting an Irish poet. [Laughter] Jill and I talk about why you were able to develop the way you developed and with the heart you have. Michelle and I have talked about it. I've confided in Michelle. I've gone to her for advice. I've—we've talked about this man.\nYou give me insight. And I think it's because, Mr. President, you gave me credit for having understanding other people's misery and suffering. Well, Mr. President, there is not one single, solitary ounce of entitlement in you or Michelle or your beautiful daughters. And you, girls, are incredible. You really are. That's not hyperbole, you really are. Not one ounce of entitlement.\nAnd Seamus Heaney, in one of his poems, said—[laughter].\nThe President. Like I said. Vice President Biden. When you can find someone who says it better, use it. [Laughter] He said, \"You carried your own burden and very soon, your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared.\" You carried your own burdens, and very soon, the creeping symptoms of privilege disappeared.\nMr. President, you have sometimes been like a lone wolf, but you carried yourself in a way that's pretty remarkable. The history of the journey—your journey—is something people are going to write about a long time, and I'm not being solicitous when I say this. And you're so fortunate, both of you, to have found each other, because all that grounding, all that you have, made this guy totally whole. And it's pretty amazing.\nMr. President, this honor is not only well beyond what I deserve, but it's a reflection on the extent and generosity of your spirit. I don't deserve this, but I know it came from the President's heart. There is a Talmudic saying that says, what comes from the heart, enters the heart. Mr. President, you have creeped into our heart—you and your whole family, including Mom—and you occupy it. It's an amazing thing that happened. I knew how smart you were. I knew how honorable you were. I knew how decent you were from the couple years we worked in the Senate, and I knew what you were capable of. But I never fully expected that you'd occupy the Bidens' heart, from Hunter to Ashley, my sister, all of us. All of us.\nAnd, Mr. President, I'm indebted to you. I'm indebted to your friendship. I'm indebted to your family. And as I'll tell you—I'll end on a humorous note—we're having a lunch, lunches, and mostly, it's what's ever in either one of our minds. We'll talk about family an awful lot. And about 6 months in, President looks at me, he said: \"You know, Joe, you know what surprised me? How we've become such good friends.\" [Laughter] And I said, \"Surprised you?\" [Laughter]\nBut that is candid Obama—[laughter]—and it's real. And, Mr. President, you know as long as there's a breath in me, I'll be there for you, my whole family will be, and I know, I know it is reciprocal. I—and I want to thank you all so very, very, very much, all of you for being here.", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Vice President Joe Biden"}

We've filed more enforcement complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) than any other WTO member, and we've won every one of those challenges that's been decided.

The Department of Homeland Security is ending the so-called \"wet-foot/dry-foot\" policy, which was put in place more than 20 years ago and was designed for a different era. Effective immediately, Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal, consistent with U.S. law and enforcement priorities. By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries. The Cuban Government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.\nToday the Department of Homeland Security is also ending the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program. The United States and Cuba are working together to combat diseases that endanger the health and lives of our people. By providing preferential treatment to Cuban medical personnel, the medical parole program contradicts those efforts and risks harming the Cuban people. Cuban medical personnel will now be eligible to apply for asylum at U.S. Embassies and consulates around the world, consistent with the procedures for all foreign nationals.\nThe United States, a land of immigrants, has been enriched by the contributions of Cuban Americans for more than a century. Since I took office, we have put the Cuban American community at the center of our policies. With this change we will continue to welcome Cubans, as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws. During my administration, we worked to improve the lives of the Cuban people inside of Cuba by providing them with greater access to resources, information, and connectivity to the wider world. Sustaining that approach is the best way to ensure that Cubans can enjoy prosperity, pursue reforms, and determine their own destiny.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on January 18.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121407", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nThrough Proclamation 7264 of January 11, 2000, President Clinton established the California Coastal National Monument (monument) to protect the biological treasures situated on thousands of unappropriated or unreserved islands, rocks, exposed reefs, and pinnacles owned or controlled by the Government of the United States within 12 nautical miles of the shoreline of the State of California. Presidential Proclamation 9089, issued on March 11, 2014, expanded the monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands, a landscape of coastal bluffs and shelves, tide pools, onshore dunes, coastal prairies, and riverbanks, and the mouth and estuary of the Garcia River. In addition to providing vital habitat for wildlife, these coastal lands were critical for the native peoples who first lived along the California Coast, and they continue to be treasured by modern generations.\nSix other spectacular areas along the California Coast contain significant scientific or historic resources that are closely tied to the values of the monument. Like the protections afforded by prior proclamations, protection of Trinidad Head, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, Lost Coast Headlands, Cotoni-Coast Dairies, Piedras Blancas, and Orange County Rocks and Islands would protect and preserve objects of historic or scientific interest on the California Coast.\nTrinidad Head\nAbout 30 miles north of Eureka lies the majestic and culturally important promontory known as Trinidad Head. The tip of Trinidad Head encompasses several prominent historic sites along with the rocky ledges that provide their setting, such as the Trinidad Head Light Station, which first operated in 1871 and is still active today. Accompanied by a small wooden bell house, it sits atop sheer cliffs overlooking crashing waves and rugged sea stacks. The importance of this location predated its first use as a lighthouse. Nearly 100 years earlier, on June 9, 1775, representatives of the local Yurok community first made contact with two Spanish ships there. A granite cross installed in 1913 sits in a clearing above the lighthouse, commemorating the spot where the Spanish erected a wooden cross two days later to claim the area for King Charles III. Today, the area is culturally and spiritually significant to the Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria, the Yurok Tribe, and the Tsurai Ancestral Society.\nCoastal bluff scrub vegetation, including coyote brush, California wax myrtle, salal, blue blossom, ocean spray, and evergreen huckleberry, surrounds these historic features. Scattered stands of Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, and red alder stand out among these native shrubs and herbs. Coast Indian paintbrush grows in rocky outcroppings near the bell house, adding splashes of crimson to the landscape. Visitors to Trinidad Head enjoy observing the Trinidad seabird colony, which makes its home on the rocks and islands off the coast of Trinidad Head and contains over 75,000 birds, including several species of cormorant, the common murre, and occasionally tufted puffins. Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch\nPerched on the edge of Table Bluff, 12 miles south of Eureka, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch has spectacular panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean, Eel River Delta, and the south spit of Humboldt Bay. In addition to outstanding scenery, visitors to Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch can view migratory raptors, songbirds, and the endangered marbled murrelet.\nWaluplh-Lighthouse Ranch is part of the ancestral home and current cultural traditions of the Wiyot Tribe, who gave it the name Waluplh. With its expansive views, the area served as a lookout point for the Tribe, as well as a crossroads for trails connecting inland areas with Humboldt Bay to the north and the bottomlands surrounding the mouth of the Eel River to the south. Beginning in the late 1800s, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch was developed as a Coast Guard facility, and during World War II, it served as a coastal lookout post and the base for a mounted beach patrol. There are no longer any buildings on the property, so visitors now enjoy its panoramic views surrounded by open space.\nLost Coast Headlands\nThirteen miles south of Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, the Lost Coast Headlands present a majestic coastline, encompassing rolling hills and dramatically eroding bluffs, punctuated by freshwater creeks, ponds, and pockets of forests. Underlying the Lost Coast Headlands are layers of highly erodible sedimentary rock known as the Wildcat Group. This geology has weathered over the years, leading to deeply carved and incised bluffs along the beach made up of multi-hued layers of gray clay, golden sandstone, and brown siltstone. The eroding of the bluffs over time exposes fossils of scallops, clams, and snails, providing a glimpse of the marine fauna that lived in the area during the Pleistocene Epoch 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago.\nCoastal scrub vegetation and open grasslands blanket the area's rolling hills. Coyote brush and California blackberry dominate, and in the grasslands, small patches of native Pacific reed grass meadow remain. Pockets of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, and grand fir shadow the eroded draws. These diverse habitats support an array of wildlife species, including black‐tailed deer, bobcat, brush rabbit, and Douglas squirrel. While more elusive, gray fox, coyote, and mountain lion also pass through the area, and a careful observer may notice signs of their presence. A variety of small birds dart about its grasslands and scrub, while raptors such as American kestrels, northern harriers, peregrine falcons, and Cooper's hawks scan for prey overhead. Quiet visitors may hear hairy woodpeckers in the forested draws. Foraging shorebirds and gulls, along with the occasional harbor seal, can be observed on the narrow beaches.\nBuffered by red alder and willow, Guthrie and Fleener creeks wind their way through the Lost Coast Headlands on their way to the sea. Both perennial streams provide habitat for three-spined stickleback, a small native fish. Sculpin, Pacific lamprey, and the threatened Northern California steelhead have also been observed in Guthrie Creek, and both creeks are potential habitat for the threatened coho salmon. During the summer, the mouth of Guthrie Creek widens into a lagoon that can provide shelter for estuary-dependent fish and invertebrates. The area also features three small, freshwater ponds that provide habitat for the threatened California red-legged frog and a variety of waterfowl, including green-winged teals.\nWhile few signs of it remain, the northernmost point of the Lost Coast Headlands was once the site of the Centerville Beach Naval Facility, established in 1958 to monitor Soviet submarines during the Cold War. For more than 100 years, several families who settled nearby grazed livestock in the area.\nCotoni-Coast Dairies\nNear Davenport in Santa Cruz County, Cotoni-Coast Dairies extends from the steep slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the marine coastal terraces overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Sitting atop the soft Santa Cruz Mudstone Formation and the hard, silica-rich Monterey Formation, the area's bedrock supports a diversity of soils and vegetation that have sustained wildlife and people alike for millennia.\nDating back at least 10,000 years, an ancestral group known to archaeologists as the Costanoan or Coastal People (also called the Ohlone) lived in this region, and the Cotoni, a tribelet of this group, lived in the Cotoni-Coast Dairies area. Lithic scatter sites and shell middens demonstrate that inhabitants moved between the coastal ecological zones and upland environments, making use of the landscape's diverse resources. Europeans first made contact with the Cotoni in the 1600s and 1700s. Most of the Costanoan people were converted to Christianity, many forcibly, during California's Mission period in the late 1700s and 1800s, and by the early 1900s, much of the ancient cultural heritage of the Coastal People was left only to memory.\nSix perennial streams form the heart of Cotoni-Coast Dairies' ecosystem, flowing from the coastal mountains down to the Pacific Ocean. Molino Creek, Ferrari Creek, San Vicente Creek, Liddell Creek, Yellow Bank Creek, and Laguna Creek have each carved steep canyons on their path to the sea. Vibrant riparian areas follow along the six stream corridors, with red alder and arroyo willow forests dominating the vegetative community. A seventh stream, Scott Creek, flows along a small portion of the area's northern boundary. Most of the area's wetlands can be found within these riparian corridors, though others exist in meadows and floodplains.\nBeyond supporting riparian and wetland communities, Cotoni-Coast Dairies' waterways provide important habitat for anadromous and freshwater fish. All of the streams are thought to have historically supported salmon populations. Today, the threatened steelhead and coho salmon can be found on spawning runs in San Vicente Creek, while steelhead are also found in Liddell Creek and Laguna Creek. The endangered tidewater goby may also be found in the tidally influenced portion of Laguna Creek. The threatened California red-legged frog uses many of the waterways and water sources here, along with a wide range of other amphibians and reptiles.\nGrasslands, scrublands, woodlands, and forests surround the riparian corridors in Cotoni-Coast Dairies. Purple needlegrass and other native species, such as California oatgrass and blue wildrye, characterize the coastal prairie grassland community. The intermixed wildflowers in the community provide visitors a colorful display in the spring and early summer. Occasional freshwater seeps amid the grasslands support sedges, California buttercup, brown-headed rush, and other species.\nCalifornia sagebrush and coyote brush scrub communities blanket the area's bluffs and hillside slopes. Native trees, including Douglas fir and coast live oak, dominate forests, which also include stands of coastal trees such as madrone, California bay, Monterey pine, and knobcone pine. Visitors are drawn to stands of coast redwood, which thrive on the north-facing slopes in some watersheds, accompanied by redwood sorrel, elk clover, and other understory species.\nThe diversity of the uplands vegetation in Cotoni-Coast Dairies supports a rich wildlife community including a vast and varied mammalian population. Among the many species inhabiting Cotoni-Coast Dairies are California voles, dusky-footed woodrats, black-tailed jackrabbits, mule deer, and gray fox. Evidence also suggests that both bobcats and mountain lions hunt here.\nVisitors to Cotoni-Coast Dairies may be able to catch a glimpse of a variety of avian species, including black swifts, orange crowned warblers, American kestrels, Cooper's hawks, white-tailed kites, and peregrine falcons. In the riparian areas, one may encounter Wilson's warblers, downy woodpeckers, and tree swallows, among others. Various bat species, including the Townsend's big-eared bat, can be seen darting overhead at dusk.\nPiedras Blancas\nOnly 40 miles north of San Luis Obispo, the large white coastal rocks for which Piedras Blancas was named have served as a landmark for centuries to explorers and traders along the central coast of California. Sitting at a cultural interface between Northern Chumash and Playanos Salinan peoples, Piedras Blancas was and still remains important to Native Americans. The human history of the area stretches back at least 3,000 years, and archaeologists have found stone tools, debris from tool knapping, discrete quarrying locations, and shell midden deposits that help tell that history. Native peoples largely used the area as a source of raw stone and for the manufacture of stone tools.\nIn 1542, the Spanish explorer Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo noted the value of this area as a maritime guidepost, and the land he sighted from his ship was later claimed by the Spanish, followed by the Governor of Mexico, and subsequently became part of the United States. A lighthouse built in the 1870s still stands today, albeit without the three upper levels that were removed after being damaged by an earthquake in 1948. The lighthouse, with its ornate brick and cast-iron structure, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places along with its surrounding buildings, such as the 1906 fog-signal and oil house. Visitors to Piedras Blancas today are treated to unmatched scenic vistas of the rugged mountain peaks of the Santa Lucia Range and the deep blue waters of the Pacific Ocean. Dramatic geologic features, such as the namesake white rocks, along with the area's characteristic fog, contribute to a dynamic visual landscape.\nThe bedrock in the area consists of both sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Franciscan Formation. This Formation represents Jurassic age material from the Pacific Plate that scraped off and attached to the continental margin of North America. Atop the bedrock lie Monterey Formation rocks, topped with marine terrace deposits. Rain percolates through the rock surface and sub-surface and emerges dramatically as ephemeral springs from cliff faces.\nCalifornia sea lions, harbor seals, and northern elephant seals all spend time on the shores and within the waters of this area. Visitors may observe colonies of massive elephant seals loafing in the sun at Piedras Blancas, where females can be seen nursing their pups, and males occasionally battle for dominance. For decades, scientists have used this land to conduct annual censuses of the threatened southern sea otter and other marine mammals. From the mainland of Piedras Blancas, visitors can also be treated to regular visits by migrating gray and humpback whales, and occasionally blue, minke, and killer whales as well, in addition to bottlenose dolphins.\nMarine birds perched on or soaring over the Piedras Blancas rocks include Brandt's cormorants, black oystercatchers, peregrine falcons, and brown pelicans. In a remarkable spring display, Pacific loons can be seen migrating offshore of Piedras Blancas by the tens of thousands. In the rocky intertidal zone found along these shores, scientists have documented mussels, ochre starfish, barnacles, sea anemones, and black and red abalones. The lighthouse's windswept onshore point is also a sanctuary for plants and wildlife. Over 70 types of native plants, including members from the agave, cashew, sunflower, carnation, morning glory, gourd, iris, and poppy families, establish a foothold in the fine sand and fine sandy loam soils. Together this diversity of vegetation can be characterized as northern coastal bluff scrub. If visitors time their visit, they will be treated to a dazzling array of blooms from species such as seaside poppy, seaside daisy, coastal bush lupine, hedge nettle, dune buckwheat, and compact cobwebby thistle. This native vegetation supports many wildlife species, including brush rabbits, California voles, dusky-footed woodrats, and bobcats. Black-bellied slender salamanders, threatened red-legged frogs, western terrestrial garter snakes, and other reptiles and amphibians thrive in the Piedras Blancas area.\nOrange County Rocks and Islands\nThis area consists of a series of offshore rocks, pinnacles, exposed reefs, and small islands off the Orange County coastline, where visitors onshore are treated to dramatic crashing waves, unique geology, and an abundance of marine-dependent wildlife. These rocks and islands lie within the current monument boundary but were not previously reserved as part of the monument. These offshore rocks, many in pocket coves, contribute to the rugged beauty of the Orange County coastline and themselves include objects of scientific and historic interest. The features also provide important connectivity from south to north for shore birds and sea birds, as well as for California sea lions and harbor seals.\nCormorants, brown pelicans, gulls, and a variety of other shore birds and sea birds can be seen roosting, resting, and feeding on the jagged rocks and small islands. These rocks and islands are also haul-out areas for marine mammals, including California sea lions, harbor seals, and the occasional northern elephant seal.\nRich in vital nutrients, this offshore zone of swirling currents supports a variety of habitats and organisms. The tide pools around these rocks and islands are home to a diversity of hardy intertidal seaweeds and animal species uniquely adapted for survival within the alternating and equally harsh environs of pounding surf and baking sun.\nThe protection of Trinidad Head, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, Lost Coast Headlands, Cotoni-Coast Dairies, Piedras Blancas, and Orange County Rocks and Islands as part of the California Coastal National Monument will preserve their cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain their diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the historic and scientific value of these areas, and their numerous objects of historic or scientific interest, remain for the benefit of all Americans.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve the objects of scientific and historic interest on the public lands of Trinidad Head, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, Lost Coast Headlands, Cotoni-Coast Dairies, Piedras Blancas, and Orange County Rocks and Islands;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be part of the California Coastal National Monument and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying maps, which are attached hereto and form a part of this proclamation.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on January 18.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121409", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nThrough Proclamation 7318 of June 9, 2000, President Bill Clinton established the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument (monument) to protect the ecological wonders and biological diversity at the interface of the Cascade, Klamath, and Siskiyou ecoregions. The area, home to an incredible variety of species and habitats, represents a rich mosaic of forests, grasslands, shrublands, and wet meadows. The many rare and endemic plant and animal species found here are a testament to Cascade-Siskiyou's unique ecosystems and biotic communities.\nAs President Clinton noted in Proclamation 7318, the ecological integrity of the ecosystems that harbor this diverse array of species is vital to their continued existence. Since 2000, scientific studies of the area have reinforced that the environmental processes supporting the biodiversity of the monument require habitat connectivity corridors for species migration and dispersal. Additionally, they require a range of habitats that can be resistant and resilient to large-scale disturbance such as fire, insects and disease, invasive species, drought, or floods, events likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Expanding the monument to include Horseshoe Ranch, the Jenny Creek watershed, the Grizzly Peak area, Lost Lake, the Rogue Valley foothills, the Southern Cascades area, and the area surrounding Surveyor Mountain will create a Cascade-Siskiyou landscape that provides vital habitat connectivity, watershed protection, and landscape-scale resilience for the area's critically important natural resources. Such an expansion will bolster protection of the resources within the original boundaries of the monument and will also protect the important biological and historic resources within the expansion area.\nThe ancient Siskiyou and Klamath Mountains meet the volcanic Cascade Mountains near the border of California and Oregon, creating an intersection of three ecoregions in Jackson and Klamath Counties in Oregon and Siskiyou County in California. Towering rock peaks covered in alpine forests rise above mixed woodlands, open glades, dense chaparral, meadows filled with stunning wildflowers, and swiftly-flowing streams.\nNative American occupancy of this remarkably diverse landscape dates back thousands of years, and Euro-American settlers also passed through the expansion area. The Applegate Trail, a branch of the California National Historic Trail, passes through both the existing monument and the expansion area following old routes used by trappers and miners, who themselves made use of trails developed by Native Americans. Today, visitors to the Applegate Trail can walk paths worn by wagon trains of settlers seeking a new life in the west. The trail, a less hazardous alternative to the Oregon Trail, began to see regular wagon traffic in 1846 and helped thousands of settlers traverse the area more safely on their way north to the Willamette Valley or south to California in search of gold—one of the largest mass migrations in American history. Soon thereafter, early ranchers, loggers, and homesteaders began to occupy the area, leaving traces of their presence, which provide potential for future research into the era of westward expansion in southwestern Oregon. A historic ranch can be seen in the Horseshoe Ranch Wildlife Area, in the northernmost reaches of California.\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou landscape is formed by the convergence of the Klamath, the Siskiyou, and the Cascade mountain ranges. The Siskiyou Mountains, which contain Oregon's oldest rocks dating to 425 million years, have an east-west orientation that connects the newer Cascade Mountains with the ancient Klamath Mountains. The tectonic action that formed the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains occurred over 130 million years ago, while the Cascades were formed by more recent volcanism. The Rogue Valley foothills contain Eocene and Miocene formations of black andesite lava along with younger High Cascade olivine basalt. In the Grizzly Peak area, the 25 million-year geologic history includes basaltic lava flows known as the Roxy Formation, along with the formation of a large strato-volcano, Mount Grizzly. Old Baldy, another extinct volcanic cone, rises above the surrounding forest in the far northeast of the expansion area.\nCascade-Siskiyou's biodiversity, which provides habitat for a dazzling array of species, is internationally recognized and has been studied extensively by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, botanists, entomologists, and wildlife biologists. Ranging from high slopes of Shasta red fir to lower elevations with Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, and oak savannas, the topography and elevation gradient of the area has helped create stunningly diverse ecosystems. From ancient and mixed-aged conifer and hardwood forests to chaparral, oak woodlands, wet meadows, shrublands, fens, and open native perennial grasslands, the landscape harbors extraordinarily varied and diverse plant communities. Among these are threatened and endangered plant species and habitat for numerous other rare and endemic species.\nGrizzly Peak and the surrounding Rogue Valley foothills in the northwest part of the expansion area are home to rare populations of plant species such as rock buckwheat, Baker's globemallow, and tall bugbane. More than 275 species of flowering plants, including Siberian spring beauty, bluehead gilia, Detling's silverpuffs, bushy blazingstar, southern Oregon buttercup, Oregon geranium, mountain lady slipper, Egg Lake monkeyflower, green-flowered ginger, and Coronis fritillary can be found here. Ferns such as the fragile fern, lace fern, and western sword fern contribute to the lush green landscape.\nAncient sugar pine and ponderosa pine thrive in the Lost Lake Research Natural Area in the north, along with white fir and Douglas fir, with patches of Oregon white oak and California black oak. Occasional giant chinquapin, Pacific yew, and bigleaf maple contribute to the diversity of tree species here. Shrubs such as western serviceberry, oceanspray, Cascade barberry, and birchleaf mountain mahogany grow throughout the area, along with herbaceous species including pale bellflower, broadleaf starflower, pipsissewa, and Alaska oniongrass. Creamy stonecrop, a flowering succulent, thrives on rocky hillsides. Patches of abundant ferns include coffee cliffbrake and arrowleaf sword fern. Moon Prairie contains a late successional stand of Douglas fir and white fir with Pacific yew, ponderosa pine, and sugar pine.\nOld Baldy's high-elevation forests in the northeast include Shasta red fir, mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir, and western white pine along with Southern Oregon Cascades chaparral. Nearby, Tunnel Creek is a high-altitude lodgepole pine swamp with bog blueberry and numerous sensitive sedge species such as capitate sedge, lesser bladderwort, slender sedge, tomentypnum moss, and Newberry's gentian. The eastern portion of the expansion, in the area surrounding Surveyor Mountain, is home to high desert species such as bitterbrush and sagebrush, along with late successional dry coniferous forests containing lodgepole pine, dry currant, and western white pine.\nThe Horseshoe Ranch Wildlife Area in Siskiyou County, California, offers particularly significant ecological connectivity and integrity. The area contains a broad meadow ecosystem punctuated by Oregon white oak and western juniper woodlands alongside high desert species such as gray rabbitbrush and antelope bitterbrush. The area is also home to the scarlet fritillary, Greene's mariposa lily, Bellinger's meadowfoam, and California's only population of the endangered Gentner's fritillary.\nThe incredible biodiversity of plant communities in the expansion is mirrored by equally stunning animal diversity, supported by the wide variety of intact habitats and undisturbed corridors allowing animal migration and movement. Perhaps most notably, the Cascade-Siskiyou landscape, including the Upper Jenny Creek Watershed and the Southern Cascades, provides vitally important habitat connectivity for the threatened northern spotted owl. Other raptors, including the bald eagle, golden eagle, white-tailed kite, peregrine falcon, merlin, great gray owl, sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper's hawk, osprey, American kestrel, northern goshawk, flammulated owl, and prairie falcon, soar above the meadows, mountains, and forests as they seek their prey.\nOrnithologists and birdwatchers alike come to the Cascade-Siskiyou landscape for the variety of birds found here. Tricolored blackbird, grasshopper sparrow, bufflehead, black swift, Lewis's woodpecker, purple martin, blue grouse, common nighthawk, dusky flycatcher, lazuli bunting, mountain quail, olive-sided flycatcher, Pacific-slope flycatcher, pileated woodpecker, ruffed grouse, rufous hummingbird, varied thrush, Vaux's swift, western meadowlark, western tanager, white-headed woodpecker, and Wilson's warbler are among the many species of terrestrial birds that make their homes in the expansion area. The Oregon vesper sparrow, among the most imperiled bird species in the region, has been documented in the meadows of the upper Jenny Creek Watershed.\nShore and marsh birds, including the Tule goose, yellow rail, snowy egret, harlequin duck, Franklin's gull, red-necked grebe, sandhill crane, pintail, common goldeneye, bufflehead, greater yellowlegs, and least sandpiper, also inhabit the expansion area's lakes, ponds, and streams.\nDiverse species of mammals, including the black-tailed deer, elk, pygmy rabbit, American pika, and northern flying squirrel, depend upon the extraordinary ecosystems found in the area. Beavers and river otters inhabit the landscape's streams and rivers, while Horseshoe Ranch Wildlife Area has been identified as a critical big game winter range. Bat species including the pallid bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, and fringed myotis hunt insects beginning at dusk. The expansion area encompasses known habitat for endangered gray wolves, including a portion of the area of known activity for the Keno wolves. Other carnivores such as the Pacific fisher, cougar, American badger, black bear, coyote, and American marten can be seen and studied in the expansion area.\nThe landscape also contains many hydrologic features that capture the interest of visitors. Rivers and streams cascade through the mountains, and waterfalls such as Jenny Creek Falls provide aquatic habitat along with scenic beauty. The upper headwaters of the Jenny Creek watershed are vital to the ecological integrity of the watershed as a whole, creating clear cold water that provides essential habitat for fish living at the margin of their environmental tolerances. Fens and wetlands, along with riparian wetlands and wet montane meadows, can be\nfound in the eastern portion of the expansion area. Lost Lake, in the northernmost portion of the expansion area, contains a large lake that serves as Western pond turtle habitat, along with another upstream waterfall.\nThe expansion area includes habitat for populations of the endemic Jenny Creek sucker and Jenny Creek redband trout, as well as habitat for the Klamath largescale sucker, the endangered shortnose sucker, and the endangered Lost River sucker. The watershed also contains potential habitat for the threatened coho salmon. Numerous species of aquatic plants grow in the area's streams, lakes, and ponds.\nAmphibians such as black salamander, Pacific giant salamander, foothill yellow-legged frog, Cascade frog, the threatened Oregon spotted frog, and the endemic Siskiyou Mountains salamander thrive here thanks to the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Reptiles found in the expansion area include the western pond turtle, northern alligator lizard, desert striped whipsnake, and northern Pacific rattlesnake.\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou landscape's remarkable biodiversity includes the astounding diversity of invertebrates found in the expansion, including freshwater mollusks like the Oregon shoulderband, travelling sideband, modoc rim sideband, Klamath taildropper, chase sideband, Fall Creek pebblesnail, Keene Creek pebblesnail, and Siskiyou hesperian. The area has been identified by evolutionary biologists as a center of endemism and diversity for springsnails, and researchers have discovered four new species of mygalomorph spiders in the expansion. Pollinators such as Franklin's bumblebee, western bumblebee, and butterflies including Johnson's hairstreak, gray blue butterfly, mardon skipper, and Oregon branded skipper are critical to the ecosystems' success. Other insects found here include the Siskiyou short-horned grasshopper and numerous species of caddisfly.\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou landscape has long been a focus for scientific studies of ecology, evolutionary biology, wildlife biology, entomology, and botany. The expansion area provides an invaluable resource to scientists and conservationists wishing to research and sustain the functioning of the landscape's ecosystems into the future.\nThe expansion area includes numerous objects of scientific or historic interest. This enlargement of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument will maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources and preserve its cultural and historic legacy, ensuring that the scientific and historic values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve the objects of scientific and historic interest on these public lands as an enlargement of the boundary of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be part of the Cascade Siskiyou National Monument and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached hereto and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 48,000 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nNothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the areas protected under Proclamation 7318. Terms used in this proclamation shall have the same meaning as those defined in Proclamation 7318.\nAll Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries described on the accompanying map are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing, other than by exchange that furthers the protective purposes of the monument.\nThe enlargement of the boundary is subject to valid existing rights. If the Federal Government subsequently acquires any lands or interests in lands not owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, and objects identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests in lands shall be part of the monument, upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government.\nThe Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the area being added to the monument through the Bureau of Land Management as a unit of the National Landscape Conservation System, under the same laws and regulations that apply to the rest of the monument, except that the Secretary may issue a travel management plan that authorizes snowmobile and non-motorized mechanized use off of roads in the area being added by this proclamation, so long as such use is consistent with the care and management of the objects identified above.\nNothing in this proclamation shall preclude low-level overflights of military aircraft, the designation of new units of special use airspace, or the use or establishment of military flight training routes over the lands reserved by this proclamation consistent with the care and management of the objects identified above.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of the State of Oregon or the State of California with respect to fish and wildlife management.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.\nWarning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Proclamation 9564—Boundary Enlargement of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument"}

Gaston Motel (Gaston Motel), located in Birmingham, Alabama, within walking distance of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Kelly Ingram Park, and other landmarks of the American civil rights movement (movement), served as the headquarters for a civil rights campaign in the spring of 1963. The direct action campaign—known as \"Project C\" for confrontation—challenged unfair laws designed to limit the freedoms of African Americans and ensure racial inequality. Throughout the campaign, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Reverend Ralph David Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR), and other movement leaders rented rooms at the Gaston Motel and held regular strategy sessions there. They also staged marches and held press conferences on the premises. Project C succeeded in focusing the world's attention on racial injustice in America and creating momentum for Federal civil rights legislation that would be enacted in 1964.\nThe Gaston Motel, the highest quality accommodation in Birmingham in 1963 that accepted African Americans, was itself the product of segregation. Arthur George (A.G.) Gaston, a successful African American businessman whose enterprises addressed the needs of his segregated community, opened the motel in 1954 to provide \"something fine that . . . will be appreciated by our people.\" In the era of segregation, African Americans faced inconveniences, indignities, and personal risk in their travels. The conveniences and comforts of the Gaston Motel were a rarity for them. The motel hosted many travelers over the years, including business and professional people; celebrities performing in the city; participants in religious, social, and political conferences; and in April-May 1963, the movement leaders, the press, and others who would bring Project C to the world stage. During Project C, King and Abernathy occupied the motel's main suite, Room 30, located on the second floor above the office and lobby, and they and their colleagues held most of their strategy sessions in the suite's sitting room.\nThe events at the Gaston Motel drew attention to State and local laws and customs that—a century after the Civil War—promoted racial inequality. In January 1963, incoming Alabama Governor George Wallace declared, \"Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!\" Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, was a bastion of segregation, enforced by law, custom, and violence. The city required the separation of races at parks, pools, playgrounds, hotels, restaurants, theaters, on buses, in taxicabs, and elsewhere. Zoning ordinances determined where African Americans could purchase property, and a line of demarcation created a virtual wall around the Fourth Avenue business district that served the African American community. Racial discrimination pervaded housing and employment. Violence was frequently used to intimidate those who dared to challenge segregation. From 1945 to 1963, Birmingham witnessed 60 bombings of African American homes, businesses, and churches, earning the city the nickname \"Bombingham.\" By early 1963, civil rights activism was also well established in Birmingham. Civil rights leaders had been spurred into action in 1956 when the State of Alabama effectively outlawed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). A sheriff served Shuttlesworth, Membership Chairman of the NAACP's Alabama chapter, with an injunction at the organization's regional headquarters in Birmingham's Masonic Temple, where many African American professionals and organizations had their offices. In swift response, Shuttlesworth formed the ACMHR in June 1956, and established its headquarters at his church, Bethel Baptist. Shuttlesworth and the ACMHR spearheaded a church-led civil rights movement in Birmingham: they held mass meetings every Monday night, pursued litigation, and initiated direct action campaigns. The ACMHR and Shuttlesworth established ties with other civil rights organizations, and developed reputations as serious forces in the civil rights movement. As the primary Birmingham contact during the 1961 Freedom Rides, Shuttlesworth and his deacons rescued multiple Freedom Riders, sheltering them at Bethel Baptist Church and its parsonage. Shuttlesworth also worked to cultivate other local protest efforts. In 1962, he supported students from Miles College as they launched a boycott of downtown stores that treated African Americans as second class citizens. A year later some of the same students would participate in Project C.\nShuttlesworth encouraged the SCLC to come to Birmingham. By early 1963, King and his colleagues decided that the intransigence of Birmingham's segregationist power structure, and the strength of its indigenous civil rights movement, created the necessary tension for a campaign that could capture the Nation's—and the Kennedy Administration's—attention, and pressure city leaders to desegregate. In the words of King, \"As Birmingham goes, so goes the South.\"\nThe plan of the Birmingham campaign was to attack Birmingham's segregated business practices during the busy and lucrative Easter shopping season through nonviolent direct action, including boycotts, marches, and sit-ins. On April 3, 1963, Shuttlesworth distributed a pamphlet entitled \"Birmingham Manifesto\" to announce the campaign to the press and encourage others to join the cause. Sit-ins at downtown stores began on April 3, as did nightly mass meetings. The first march of the campaign was on April 6, 1963. Participants gathered in the courtyard of the Gaston Motel and started to march toward City Hall, but the police department under the command of Commissioner of Public Safety T. Eugene \"Bull\" Connor stopped them within three blocks, arrested them, and sent them to jail. The next day, Birmingham police, assisted by their canine corps, again quickly stopped the march from St. Paul United Methodist Church toward City Hall, containing the protesters in Kelly Ingram Park.\nOver the next few days, as the possibility of violence increased, some local African American leaders, including A.G. Gaston, questioned Project C. In response, King created a 25-person advisory committee to allow discussion of the leaders' different viewpoints. The advisory committee met daily at the Gaston Motel and reviewed each day's plan.\nOn April 10, the city obtained an injunction against the marches and other demonstrations from a State court, and served it on King, Abernathy, and Shuttlesworth in the Gaston Motel restaurant at 1:00 a.m. on April 11. During the Good Friday march on April 12, King, Abernathy, and others were arrested. King was placed in solitary confinement, drawing the attention of the Kennedy Administration, which began to monitor developments in Birmingham. While jailed, King wrote his famous \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\" His letter was a response to a statement published in the local newspaper by eight moderate white\nclergymen who supported integration but opposed the direct action campaign as \"unwise and untimely.\" They believed that negotiations and legal processes were the appropriate means to end segregation, and without directly naming him, portrayed King as an outsider trying to stir up civil unrest. In response, King wrote, \"I am in Birmingham because injustice is here.\"\nWhile King was in jail, the campaign lost momentum. Upon King's release, James Bevel, a young SCLC staffer, proposed what would become known as the \"Children's Crusade,\" a highly controversial strategy aimed at capturing the Nation's attention. On May 2—dubbed D-Day—hundreds of African American teenagers prepared to march from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to City Hall. With a crowd of bystanders present, police began arresting young protesters in Kelly Ingram Park. Overwhelmed by the number of protesters, estimated at 1,000, Commissioner Connor called for school buses to transport those arrested to jail. On May 3—Double-D Day—Connor readied his forces for another mass march by stationing police, canine units, and firemen at Kelly Ingram Park. As the young protesters entered the park, authorities ordered them to evacuate the area; when they did not leave, firemen trained their water cannons on them. The high-pressure jets of water knocked them to the ground and tore at their clothing. Connor next deployed the canine corps to disperse the crowd. Police directed six German shepherds towards the crowd and commanded them to attack. Reporters documented the violence, and the next day the country was confronted with dramatic scenes of brutal police aggression against civil rights protesters. These vivid examples of segregation and racial injustice shocked the conscience of the Nation and the world.\nThe marches and demonstrations continued. Fearing civil unrest and irreparable damage to the city's reputation, on May 8 the Birmingham business community and local leaders agreed to release the peaceful protesters, integrate lunch counters, and begin to hire African Americans. On May 10, 1963, the Gaston Motel served as the site to announce this compromise between local white leaders and civil rights advocates. The motel was bombed around midnight. The bomb blasted a door-sized hole into the reception area below King's second story suite and damaged the water main and electrical lines. King was not in Birmingham at the time. His brother, A.D. King, whose own home in Birmingham had been bombed earlier in the day, worked to calm outraged African Americans and avoid an escalation of violence.\nDespite the negotiated peace, African Americans in Birmingham continued to face hostile resistance to integration. That fall, Governor Wallace, in violation of a Federal court order, directed State troopers to prevent desegregation of Alabama public schools. When a Federal court issued injunctions against the troopers, the Governor called out the National Guard. To counter that action, President John F. Kennedy federalized and withdrew the National Guard, thereby allowing desegregation. In response, on September 15, 1963, white supremacists planted a bomb at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, all of whom were 14, and Denise McNair, 11, were killed. The explosion injured 22 others and left significant damage to the church. King traveled to Birmingham to deliver the eulogy for the little girls. This act of domestic terrorism again shocked the conscience of the Nation and the world.\nPublic outrage over the events in Birmingham produced political pressure that helped to ensure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which President Lyndon Johnson signed into law on July 2, 1964. Later that year, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the public accommodation provisions (Title II) of the Act. Several Southern politicians announced that laws must be respected, and across the South outward signs of segregation began to disappear.\nPartially as a result of the Federal legislation outlawing discrimination in public accommodations, business at the Gaston Motel suffered. African Americans had more choices in motels and dining. When King returned to Birmingham for an SCLC conference in 1964, he and three dozen colleagues checked into the Parliament House, then considered Birmingham's finest hotel. A.G. Gaston modernized and expanded his motel in 1968, adding a large supper club and other amenities, but business continued to fall through the 1970s. In 1982, Gaston announced that the motel would be converted into housing for the elderly and handicapped. The use of the property for this purpose ceased in 1996, and the former Gaston Motel has sat vacant ever since.\nAlthough some people continued to resist integration following the events of the early 1960s, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and its enforcement by the Department of Justice, had the effect of eliminating official segregation of public accommodations. Today, the Gaston Motel, the Birmingham Civil Rights Historic District in which the motel is located, the Bethel Baptist Church, and other associated resources all stand as a testament to the heroism of those who worked so hard to advance the cause of freedom.\nThus, the sites of these events contain objects of historic interest from a critical period in American history.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, the Birmingham Civil Rights Historic District (Historic District) was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2006, as a nationally significant property associated with the climax of the civil rights struggle during the 1956-63 period; and the Historic District contains three key areas and the streets that connect them, covering 36 acres throughout the city; and the Gaston Motel, located in the African American commercial and cultural area known as Northside, is deemed a \"major significant resource\" in the Historic District;\nWhereas, many other Birmingham places have been listed and recognized for their historic roles in the Birmingham civil rights story, including by designation as National Historic Landmarks;\nWhereas, the City of Birmingham has donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation fee and easement interests in the Gaston Motel, totaling approximately 0.23 acres in fee and 0.65 acres in a historic preservation easement;\nWhereas, the National Trust for Historic Preservation has relinquished and conveyed all of these lands and interests in lands associated with the Gaston Motel to the Federal Government for the purpose of establishing a unit of the National Park System;\nWhereas, the designation of a national monument to be administered by the National Park Service would recognize the historic significance of the Gaston Motel in the Birmingham civil rights story and provide a national platform for telling that story;\nWhereas, the City of Birmingham and the National Park Service intend to cooperate in the preservation, operation, and maintenance of the Gaston Motel, and interpretation and education related to the civil rights struggle in Birmingham;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the Gaston Motel in Birmingham, Alabama and the historic objects associated with it within a portion of the Historic District;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation.

In organizing the 1961 Freedom Rides, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) was building upon earlier efforts of other civil rights organizations, including the 1947 \"Journey of Reconciliation,\" an integrated bus ride through the segregated Upper South. The purpose of the 1961 Freedom Rides was to test if bus station facilities in the Deep South were complying with U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) had reversed the infamous \"separate but equal\" doctrine in public education, and Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960) had struck down Virginia laws compelling segregation in interstate travel.\nThese rulings were the result of successful litigation brought by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which laid the groundwork for direct action campaigns by civil rights organizations like CORE, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). These organizations had gathered strength, and by the 1950s had launched mass movements that demonstrated the power of nonviolent protest. At the same time, reaction to the decision in Brown v. Board of Education had heightened racial tensions in the country, especially in the Deep South. White Citizens' Councils, made up of politicians, businessmen, and civic leaders committed to resisting integration, formed throughout the South. In 1956, over 100 members of Congress signed the \"Southern Manifesto,\" which criticized the Brown decision and called for resistance to its implementation. This campaign of massive resistance launched by white segregationists reinforced their determination to assure continued separation of the races in public spaces.\nAgainst this background, on May 4, 1961, in Washington, D.C., eleven Freedom Riders split into two groups and boarded two buses, a Greyhound bus and a Trailways bus, bound for New Orleans. The Greyhound bus carrying the first of these groups left Atlanta, Georgia on Sunday, May 14, and pulled into a Greyhound bus station in Anniston, Alabama later that day. There, a segregationist mob, including members of the Ku Klux Klan, violently attacked the Freedom Riders. The attackers threw rocks at the bus, broke windows, and slashed tires. Belatedly, police officers arrived and cleared a path, allowing the bus to depart with a long line of vehicles in pursuit. Two cars pulled ahead of the bus and forced the bus to slow to a crawl. Six miles outside of town, the bus's slashed tires gave out and the driver stopped on the shoulder of Highway 202. There, with the Freedom Riders onboard, one member of the mob threw a flaming bundle of rags through one of the windows that caused an explosion seconds later. The Freedom Riders struggled to escape as members of the mob attempted to trap them inside the burning bus. When they finally broke free, they received little aid for their injuries. Later that day, deacons dispatched by Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth of Birmingham's Bethel Baptist Church rescued the Freedom Riders from the hostile mob at Anniston Hospital and drove them to Birmingham for shelter at the church. A freelance photojournalist captured the horrific scene of the attack in photographs, which appeared on the front pages of newspapers across America the next day. The brutal portrayal of segregation in the South shocked many Americans and forced the issue of racial segregation in interstate travel to the forefront of the American conscience.\nWhen the Trailways bus, which had departed Atlanta an hour after the Greyhound bus, arrived in Anniston, the Trailways station was mostly quiet. A group of Klansmen boarded the bus and forcibly segregated the Freedom Riders. With all aboard, the bus left on its two-hour trip to Birmingham during which the Klansmen continued to intimidate and harass the Freedom Riders. When the Trailways bus arrived in Birmingham, a mob of white men and women attacked the Freedom Riders, reporters, and bystanders with fists, iron pipes, baseball bats, and other weapons, while the police department under the charge of Commissioner of Public Safety T. Eugene \"Bull\" Connor was nowhere to be seen. After fifteen minutes of violence, the mob retreated and the police appeared.\nLeaders of the Nashville Student Movement, including members of SNCC, firmly believed that they could not let violence prevail over nonviolence. They organized an interracial group of volunteers to travel to Birmingham and resume the Freedom Rides. Under police protection negotiated with help from the Kennedy Administration, on May 20, these SNCC Freedom Riders departed Birmingham en route to Montgomery, Alabama, where an angry white mob viciously attacked them. The next night, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—who had not been involved in the planning of the Freedom Rides—joined Reverend Ralph David Abernathy and Reverend Shuttlesworth at a mass meeting in Abernathy's First Baptist Church in Montgomery. A white mob gathered outside the church, attacked African American onlookers, and held hostage the civil rights leaders and approximately 1,500 attendees inside the church. King remained in telephone communication with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy while U.S. marshals attempted to repel the siege. Finally, Governor John Patterson was forced to declare martial law and send in the National Guard.\nMedia coverage of the Freedom Rides inspired many people to take action and join the effort to end racial inequality. Over the summer of 1961, the number of Freedom Riders grew to over 400, many of whom were arrested and jailed for their activism. The Freedom Rides of 1961 focused national attention on Southern segregationists' disregard for U.S. Supreme Court rulings and the violence that they used to enforce unconstitutional State and local segregation laws and practices. The Freedom Rides forced the Federal Government to take steps to ban segregation in interstate bus travel. On May 29, 1961, Attorney General Kennedy petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to issue regulations banning segregation, and the ICC subsequently decreed that by November 1, 1961, bus carriers and terminals serving interstate travel had to be integrated.\nAs described above, the sites of these events contain objects of historic interest from a critical period of American history.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; Whereas, the City of Anniston has donated to The Conservation Fund fee title to the former Greyhound bus station building in downtown Anniston, Alabama, approximately 0.17 acres of land;\nWhereas, Calhoun County has donated to The Conservation Fund fee title to the site of the bus burning outside Anniston, Alabama, approximately 5.79 acres of land;\nWhereas, The Conservation Fund has relinquished and conveyed all of these lands to the United States of America;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the historic objects associated with the former Greyhound bus station in Anniston, Alabama, and the site of the bus burning outside Anniston in Calhoun County, Alabama;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Freedom Riders National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on January 19.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121406", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nThe Reconstruction Era, a period spanning the early Civil War years until the start of Jim Crow racial segregation in the 1890s, was a time of significant transformation in the United States, as the Nation grappled with the challenge of integrating millions of newly freed African Americans into its social, political, and economic life. It was in many ways the Nation's Second Founding, as Americans abolished slavery and struggled earnestly, if not always successfully, to build a nation of free and equal citizens. During Reconstruction, Congress passed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth constitutional amendments that abolished slavery, guaranteed due process and equal protection under the law, and gave all males the ability to vote by prohibiting voter discrimination based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Ultimately, the unmet promises of Reconstruction led to the modern civil rights movement a century later.\nThe Reconstruction Era began when the first United States soldiers arrived in slaveholding territories, and enslaved people on plantations and farms and in cities escaped from their owners and sought refuge with Union forces or in free states. This happened in November 1861 in the Sea Islands or \"Lowcountry\" of southeastern South Carolina, and Beaufort County in particular. Just seven months after the start of the Civil War, Admiral Samuel F. DuPont led a successful attack on Port Royal Sound and brought a swath of this South Carolina coast under Union control. The white residents (less than twenty percent of the population), including the wealthy owners of rice and cotton plantations, quickly abandoned their country plantations and their homes in the town of Beaufort as Union forces came ashore. More than 10,000 African Americans—about one-third of the enslaved population of the Sea Islands at the time—refused to flee the area with their owners.\nBeaufort County became one of the first places in the United States where formerly enslaved people could begin integrating themselves into free society. While the Civil War raged in the background, Beaufort County became the birthplace of Reconstruction, or what historian Willie Lee Rose called a \"rehearsal for Reconstruction.\" With Federal forces in charge of the Sea Islands, the Department of the Treasury, with the support of President Lincoln and the War Department, decided to turn the military occupation into a novel social experiment, known as the Port Royal Experiment, to help former slaves become self-sufficient. They enlisted antislavery and religious societies in the North to raise resources and recruit volunteers for the effort. Missionary organizations headquartered in the Northeast established outposts in Beaufort County.\nIn and around Beaufort County during Reconstruction, the first African Americans enlisted as soldiers, the first African American schools were founded, early efforts to distribute land to former slaves took place, and many of the Reconstruction Era's most significant African American politicians, including Robert Smalls, came to prominence. African American political influence and land ownership endured there long after setbacks in other regions. In short, events and people from Beaufort County illustrate the most important challenges of Reconstruction—crucial questions related to land, labor, education, and politics after the destruction of slavery—and some early hopeful efforts to address them. The significant historical events that transpired in Beaufort County make it an ideal place to tell stories of experimentation, potential transformation, hope, accomplishment, and disappointment. In Beaufort County, including St. Helena Island, the town of Port Royal, and the city of Beaufort, many existing historic objects demonstrate the transformative effect of emancipation and Reconstruction.\nFreed people hungered for education, as South Carolina had long forbidden teaching slaves to read and write. In 1862, Laura M. Towne and Ellen Murray from Pennsylvania were among the first northern teachers to arrive as part of the Port Royal Experiment. They established a partnership as educators at the Penn School on St. Helena Island that lasted for four decades. Charlotte Forten, a well-educated African American woman from a prominent abolitionist family in Philadelphia, joined the faculty later that year. The first classes for the former slaves were held at The Oaks plantation house, headquarters of the occupying U.S. military forces in the region. In 1863, Murray and Towne moved their school into Brick Church, a Baptist church near the center of the island. In the spring of 1864, supporters in Philadelphia purchased school buildings for Towne and Murray, and construction of Penn School began across the field from Brick Church on 50 acres of property donated by Hastings Gantt, an African American landowner.\nPenn School helped many African Americans gain self-respect and self-reliance and integrate into free society. Towne and Murray strove to provide an education comparable to that offered in the best northern schools. The faculty also provided other support, including medical care, social services, and employment assistance. Penn School would evolve into the Penn Center in the 20th century, and remain a crucial place for education, community, and political organizing for decades to come. As a meeting place in the 1950s and 60s for civil rights leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the staff of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, this historic place links the democratic aspirations of Reconstruction to those of the modern civil rights movement. Darrah Hall is the oldest standing structure on the site of the Penn School grounds. Students and community members built it around 1903, during the transition in the South from the Reconstruction Era to an era of racial segregation and political disenfranchisement.\nThe Brick Church where Towne and Murray held classes in 1863-64 is today the oldest church on St. Helena Island. Once freed from their owners, African Americans in Beaufort County wanted to worship in churches and join organizations they controlled. The Brick Church—also known as the Brick Baptist Church—was built by slaves in 1855 for the white planters on St. Helena Island. When the white population fled from the Sea Islands in 1861, the suddenly freed African Americans made the church their own. The Brick Church has been a place of worship and gathering ever since, and continues to serve the spiritual needs of the community to this day.\nCamp Saxton in Port Royal—formerly the site of a plantation owned by John Joyner Smith—is where the First South Carolina Regiment Volunteers mustered into the U.S. Army and trained from November 1862 to January 1863. In August 1862, U.S. Brigadier General Rufus Saxton, the military governor of the abandoned plantations in the Department of the South, received permission to recruit five thousand African Americans, mostly former slaves, into the Union Army. The former slaves assumed that military service would lead to rights of citizenship. Saxton selected Captain Thomas Wentworth Higginson of the 51st Massachusetts, a former Unitarian minister, abolitionist, and human rights activist, to command the regiment. An important ally of Higginson and the African American troops was Harriet Tubman, the famed conductor on the Underground Railroad, who in May of 1862 arrived in Beaufort as part of the Port Royal Experiment and who served skillfully as a nurse at Camp Saxton.\nCamp Saxton was also the location of elaborate and historic ceremonies on January 1, 1863, to announce and celebrate the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all slaves in states then \"in rebellion\" against the United States. General Saxton himself had attended church services at the Brick Church in the fall of 1862 to recruit troops and to invite everyone, African American and white, \"to come to the camp . . . on New Year's Day, and join in the grand celebration.\" This Emancipation Proclamation celebration was particularly significant because it occurred in Union-occupied territory in the South where the provisions of the Proclamation would actually take effect before the end of the war.\nOver five thousand people, including freed men, women, and children, Union military officials, guest speakers, and missionary teachers, gathered around the speakers' platform built in a grove of live oaks near the Smith plantation house. One of the majestic witness trees has become known as the Emancipation Oak. Of all the prayers, hymns, and speeches during the three-hour ceremony, one of the most moving was the spontaneous singing of \"My country, tis of thee; Sweet land of liberty\" when the American flag was presented to Higginson. As part of the celebration, the military had prepared a feast of roasted oxen for all to enjoy.\nThe town of Beaufort was the center of the County's social, political, cultural, and economic life during the Reconstruction Era. Before the Battle of Port Royal Sound in November 1861, Beaufort was where the planters spent the summer months in their grand homes. Beaufort served as the depot for plantation supplies transported there by steamship. The Old Beaufort Firehouse, built around 1912, stands near the heart of Reconstruction Era Beaufort, across the street from the Beaufort Arsenal, and within walking distance of over fifty historic places. The Beaufort Arsenal, the location today of the Beaufort History Museum, was built in 1799, rebuilt in 1852, and renovated by the Works Progress Administration in 1934, and served historically as the home of the Beaufort Volunteer Artillery Company that fought in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.\nSeveral historic Beaufort properties within walking distance of the Firehouse are associated with Robert Smalls, the most influential African American politician in South Carolina during the Reconstruction Era. Robert Smalls was born in Beaufort in 1839, the son of slaves of the Henry McKee family. When Smalls was twelve years old, his owner hired him out to work in Charleston, where he learned to sail, rig, and pilot ships. In May 1862, Smalls navigated the CSS Planter, a Confederate ship, through Charleston harbor, past the guns of Fort Sumter, and turned it over to Union forces. This courageous escape made him an instant hero for the Union, and he soon began working as a pilot for the U.S. Navy. Smalls and his family used prize money awarded for the Planter to purchase the house in Beaufort once owned by the family that had owned him.\nIn 1864, Smalls was named to a delegation of African American South Carolinians to the Republican National Convention in Baltimore, where the delegation unsuccessfully petitioned the party to make African American enfranchisement part of its platform. Elected to the Beaufort County School Board in 1867, Smalls began his advocacy for education as the key to African American success in the new political and economic order. In the years immediately following the end of the Civil War, the United States fiercely debated issues critical to Reconstruction. Southern Democrats tried to regain the power they held before the Civil War. The Republican majorities in the U.S. Congress rebuffed them, and proceeded to pass legislation and constitutional amendments to implement the principles of the Union victory. In 1867, Congress passed the Military Reconstruction Acts that called for military administration of southern states and new state constitutions. Voters elected Robert Smalls as a delegate to the South Carolina Constitutional Convention that met in Charleston in January 1868, where he successfully advocated for public education with compulsory attendance. The resulting constitution also provided for universal male suffrage and racial, political, and legal equality. In this new political order, Robert Smalls was elected to the South Carolina General Assembly from 1868 to 1874, first as a representative and then as a senator. In 1874, Smalls was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served five terms.\nThe success of Smalls and other African American lawmakers who had been enslaved only a handful of years before infuriated South Carolina's Democrats. Some of them turned to violence, carried out by the Ku Klux Klan and others. On more than one occasion, a homegrown vigilante group known as the Red Shirts terrorized Robert Smalls.\nAs a result of the contested Presidential and South Carolina gubernatorial elections of 1876, deals were made that effectively ended political and military Reconstruction in 1877. Smalls, however, continued to serve in Congress until 1886. He then returned to Beaufort, and served for many years as the Presidentially appointed customs collector for the Port of Beaufort.\nIn 1895, Smalls was elected a delegate to his second South Carolina Constitutional Convention. Twenty years after Democrats had regained control of the State government, they had figured out how to take back African Americans' rights as citizens. Smalls spoke eloquently at the Convention against this blow to democracy and representative government, but ultimately rights hard won three decades before were struck down. South Carolina voters ratified a new constitution that effectively eliminated African Americans from electoral politics and codified racial segregation in law for decades to come.\nEven as Jim Crow laws and customs limited political participation and access to public accommodations, African Americans maintained visions of freedom and built strong community institutions. Ownership of land, access to education, and churches and civic organizations that took root during the Reconstruction Era laid the foundation for the modern civil rights movement.\nThe many objects of historic interest described above stand testament to the formative role of the Reconstruction Era—and the enormous contributions of those who made it possible—in our shared history.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, the Beaufort National Historic Landmark District, which contains many objects of historic interest including the Old Beaufort Firehouse, was designated in 1973; and the\nPenn School National Historic Landmark District, which also contains many objects of historic interest including Darrah Hall and the Brick Baptist Church, was designated in 1974;\nWhereas, the Camp Saxton Site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1995;\nWhereas, portions of the former Camp Saxton Site are located today on lands administered by the U.S. Department of the Navy at Naval Support Facility Beaufort, South Carolina;\nWhereas, Penn Center, Inc., has donated to the United States fee title to Darrah Hall at Penn Center, St. Helena Island, South Carolina, with appurtenant easements, totaling approximately 3.78 acres of land and interests in land;\nWhereas, Brick Baptist Church has donated to the United States a historic preservation easement in the Brick Baptist Church and associated cemetery located on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, an interest in land of approximately 0.84 acres;\nWhereas, the Paul H. Keyserling Revocable Trust and Beaufort Works, LLC, have donated to the United States fee title to the Old Beaufort Firehouse at 706 Craven Street, Beaufort, South Carolina, approximately 0.08 acres of land;\nWhereas, the designation of a national monument to be administered by the National Park Service would recognize the historic significance of Brick Baptist Church, Darrah Hall, Camp Saxton, and the Old Beaufort Firehouse, and provide a national platform for telling the story of Reconstruction;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect these sites;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Reconstruction Era National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. The reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 15.56 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nAll Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries described on the accompanying map are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.\nThe establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights. If the Federal Government acquires any lands or interests in lands not owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, and objects identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests in lands shall be part of the monument, upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government.\nThe Secretary of the Interior shall manage the monument through the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent with the purposes and provisions of this proclamation. The Secretary of the Interior shall prepare a management plan within 3 years of the date of this proclamation, with full public involvement, and to include coordination with Penn Center, Inc., Brick Baptist Church, the Department of the Navy, Atlantic Marine Corps Communities, LLC, the City of Beaufort, and the Town of Port Royal. The management plan shall ensure that the monument fulfills the following purposes for the benefit of present and future generations: (1) to preserve and protect the objects of historic interest associated with the monument, and (2) to interpret the objects, resources, and values related to the Reconstruction Era. The management plan shall, among other things, set forth the desired relationship of the monument to other related resources, programs, and organizations, both within and outside the National Park System.\nThe Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Navy's designee, shall continue to have management authority over Department of the Navy lands within the monument boundary at the Camp Saxton site, including the authority to control access to these lands. The Secretaries of the Navy and the Interior shall enter into a memorandum of agreement that identifies and assigns the responsibilities of each agency related to such lands, the implementing actions required of each agency, and the processes for resolving interagency disputes.\nThe National Park Service is directed to use applicable authorities to seek to enter into agreements with others to address common interests and promote management efficiencies, including provision of visitor services, interpretation and education, establishment and care of museum collections, and preservation of historic objects.\nGiven the location of portions of the monument on an operating military facility, the following provisions concern U.S. Armed Forces actions by a Military Department, including those carried out by the United States Coast Guard:\n1. Nothing in this Proclamation precludes the activities and training of the Armed Forces; however, they shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the care and management of the objects to the extent practicable.\n2. In the event of threatened or actual destruction of, loss of, or injury to a monument resource or quality resulting from an incident caused by a component of the Department of Defense or any other Federal agency, the appropriate Secretary or agency head shall promptly coordinate with the Secretary of the Interior for the purpose of taking appropriate action to respond to and mitigate the harm and, if possible, restore or replace the monument resource or quality.\n3. Nothing in this proclamation or any regulation implementing it shall limit or otherwise affect the U.S. Armed Forces' discretion to use, maintain, improve, or manage any real property under the administrative control of a Military Department or otherwise limit the availability of such real property for military mission purposes.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to alter the authority or responsibility of any party with respect to emergency response activities within the monument.\nWarning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Proclamation 9567—Establishment of the Reconstruction Era National Monument"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This memorandum was published in the  Federal Register  on January 19.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121396", "text": "Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\nSubject: Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Our National Parks, National Forests, and Other Public Lands and Waters\nOur Federal lands and waters are among our Nation's greatest treasures—from our National Parks and National Forests, to our wild and scenic rivers, recreation areas, and other public lands and waters. These natural and historic sites give us fresh air and clean water, places for recreation and inspiration, and support for our local communities and economies. As a powerful sign of our democratic ideals, these lands belong to all Americans—rich and poor, urban and rural, young and old, from all backgrounds, genders, cultures, religious viewpoints, and walks of life.\nOur public lands and waters are treasured in part because they tell the story of our Nation. They preserve the history from our Nation's wars, protect cultural sites considered sacred to countless Americans, and honor the accomplishments of distinctly American leaders ranging from Harriet Tubman to Abraham Lincoln to Cesar Chavez. I am proud that my Administration has greatly expanded the stories that our protected public lands and waters tell about our Nation through designating a diverse collection of cultural and historic sites as new parks and monuments and by restoring the Koyukon Athabascan name of Denali to the tallest mountain in North America. I am proud, too, that my Administration has sought to expand access to our public lands and waters and to make them more welcoming to all Americans, especially those who have not regularly visited our Nation's great outdoors or had the means to do so easily. Initiatives like \"Every Kid in a Park\" complement additional, ongoing efforts by Federal agencies to improve accessibility, but more work must be done to honor the promise and opportunity of the idea that our public lands belong to every American. Over the last 8 years, Federal land and water management agencies have also shown a renewed commitment to promoting equal opportunity for all employees and in creating work environments where everyone is empowered to reach their full potential.\nThe purpose of this memorandum is to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to experience and enjoy our public lands and waters, that all segments of the population have the chance to engage in decisions about how our lands and waters are managed, and that our Federal workforce—not just the sites it manages—is drawn from the rich range of the diversity in our Nation. In this memorandum, \"diversity\" refers to a range of characteristics including national origin, language, race, color, disability, ethnicity, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity), socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structure. The term \"inclusion\" refers to a culture that connects each employee to the organization; encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness; and promotes diversity throughout the organization so that all individuals have opportunities to participate and contribute to their full potential. This memorandum is directed at the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Forest Service, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (covered agencies).\nPromoting diversity and inclusion is not the sole responsibility of one office within a Federal agency but a joint effort that requires engagement by senior leadership and the entire workforce. In implementing the guidance in this memorandum, each covered agency shall ensure its diversity and inclusion practices are fully integrated into broader planning efforts and supported by sufficient resource allocations and effective programs that promote a wide range of investments in personnel development, public engagement, and opportunities for inclusive access.\nTherefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce. The quality and integrity of our National Parks, National Forests, and other public lands and waters depend on the public servants who steward them for the benefit of current and future generations. To ensure we are managing these resources responsibly, we must have a diverse and inclusive Federal workforce practicing public land management that recognizes the challenges facing communities across the Nation. A more diverse and inclusive Federal workforce also creates a more welcoming experience for all Americans, no matter their background or where they live, and encourages engagement with Federal agencies on the management and future of our public lands and waters. Consistent with existing authorities, each covered agency shall prioritize building a more diverse and inclusive Federal workforce reflective of our Nation and its citizens.\nFederal agencies are subject to existing authorities aimed at addressing the leadership role and obligations of the Federal Government as an employer. For example, Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce), requires Federal agencies to take action to promote equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion in the Federal workforce. Federal agencies also are required by section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to take proactive steps to ensure equal opportunity for all Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment. This memorandum directs each of the covered agencies to pursue additional actions that create and maintain a diverse and inclusive Federal workforce. Toward that end, each covered agency shall integrate the following activities in its efforts to comply with related statutory mandates, Executive Orders, regulatory requirements, and individual agency policies:\n(a) Provide professional development opportunities and tools. A diverse and inclusive work environment enhances the ability of each covered agency to create, retain, and sustain a strong workforce by allowing all employees to perform to their full potential and talent. Professional development opportunities and tools are key to fostering that potential, and ensuring that all employees have access to them should be a priority for all agencies, consistent with merit system principles. Accordingly, each covered agency shall:\n(i) Develop a mechanism to conduct periodic interviews with a voluntary representative cross-section of its workforce to gain a more complete understanding of the reasons that employees choose to stay with their organizations, as well as to receive feedback on workplace policies, professional development opportunities, and other issues;\n(ii) Provide optional exit interviews or surveys for all departing personnel; (iii) Collect information as needed to identify methods for attracting applicants to Federal employment and retaining diverse workplace talent through existing workforce programs and initiatives;\n(iv) Prioritize resources, as appropriate, to expand professional development opportunities that support mission needs, such as academic and fellowship programs, private-public exchanges, and detail assignments to private or international organizations, State, local and tribal governments, or other branches of the Federal Government;\n(v) Offer, or sponsor employees to participate in, a Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program or other program that trains employees to gain the skills required for senior-level appointments. Each covered agency shall consider the number of expected senior-level vacancies as one factor in determining the number of candidates to select for such programs. In the selection process for these programs, each covered agency shall consider redacting personal information, including applicant names, from all materials provided for review to reduce the potential for unconscious bias. Each covered agency also shall evaluate on a retroactive basis the placement rate of program graduates into senior-level positions, including available demographic data, on an annual basis to look for ways to improve outreach and recruitment for these programs consistent with merit system principles. Each covered agency shall consult with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the development or enhancement of data-collection tools to conduct these evaluations; and\n(vi) Seek additional opportunities for the development and implementation of upward mobility programs.\n(b) Strengthen leadership engagement and accountability. Senior leadership and supervisors play an important role in fostering diversity and inclusion in the workforce they lead and setting an example for cultivating this and future generations of talent. Toward that end, each covered agency shall:\n(i) Reward and recognize efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce. Consistent with merit system principles, each covered agency is strongly encouraged to consider implementing performance and advancement requirements that reward and recognize senior leaders' and supervisors' success in fostering diverse and inclusive workplace environments and in cultivating talent, such as through participation in mentoring programs or sponsorship initiatives, recruitment events, and other opportunities. Each covered agency also is encouraged to identify opportunities for senior leadership and supervisors to participate in outreach events and discuss issues related to promoting diversity and inclusion in its workforce on a regular basis with support from any existing employee resource group, as appropriate; and\n(ii) Expand training on unconscious bias, diversity and inclusion, and flexible work policies. Each covered agency shall expand its provision of training on unconscious bias, diversity and inclusion, and flexible work policies and make unconscious bias training mandatory for senior leadership and management positions, including for employees responsible for outreach, recruitment, hiring, career development, promotion, and law enforcement. The provision of training may be implemented in a phased approach commensurate with agency resources. Each covered agency shall\nalso make available training on a 2-year cycle for bureaus, directorates, or divisions for which inclusion scores, such as those measured by the New IQ index, demonstrate no improvement since the previous training cycle. Special attention should be given to ensure the continuous incorporation of research-based best practices, including those to address the relationship between certain demographics and job positions.\n(c) Analyze existing data and identify opportunities for improvement. Each covered agency shall continue to evaluate and eliminate existing barriers to the successful growth of diversity and inclusion in the Federal workplace. The following actions shall be taken to ensure continued progress on this issue:\n(i) Each covered agency shall integrate the activities described under subsections (a) and (b) of this section in the priorities and actions outlined in Executive Order 13583 and the periodic agency self-assessments and barrier analyses required by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Management Directive 715, and shall make such assessments and analyses publicly available;\n(ii) Human resources and any appropriate diversity and leadership staff from each of the covered agencies shall meet at least twice each year with agency leadership to discuss actions pursued under sections 1(a) and 1(b) of this memorandum, including working to identify and eliminate barriers to promoting diversity and inclusion in agency workforces and to discuss potential actions to improve hiring programs, recruitment, and workforce training and development. Where data gaps are identified, each covered agency is encouraged to collect additional information as needed in order to identify methods for attracting and retaining talent from diverse populations, with particular attention to senior and management positions. Each covered agency shall consult with OPM on the development or enhancement of data-collection tools to collect this information; and\n(iii) OPM shall continue to review covered agency-specific diversity and inclusion plans and provide recommended modifications for agency consideration, including recommendations on strategies to promote diversity and inclusion in agency workforces and potential improvements to the use of existing agency hiring authorities.\nSec. 2. Enhancing Opportunities for all Americans to Experience Public Lands and Waters. (a) Recognizing that our public lands belong to all Americans, it is critical that all Americans can experience Federal lands and waters and the benefits they provide, and that diverse populations are able to provide input to inform the management and stewardship of these important resources. In order to achieve this goal, each covered agency shall:\n(i) Identify site-specific opportunities. As each covered agency periodically updates or develops new management plans for its lands and waters, it shall evaluate specific barriers and opportunities, as appropriate, to improve visitation, access, and recreational opportunities for diverse populations;\n(ii) Update policies to ensure engagement with diverse constituencies. As policy manuals and handbooks are updated, each covered agency shall ensure that these materials reflect the importance of engaging with diverse populations in resource protection, land and water management, and program planning and decisionmaking, as appropriate;\n(iii) Establish internal policies for recipients of Federal funding. Each covered agency shall ensure that State, local, tribal, and private sector recipients of Federal funding are taking action to improve visitation, access, and recreational opportunities for diverse populations;\n(iv) Identify public liaisons. Within 90 days of the issuance of this memorandum, each covered agency shall identify multiple public liaisons with a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to be charged with facilitating input from and engaging with diverse populations in land and water management processes;\n(v) Identify opportunities on advisory councils and stakeholder committees. Within 120 days of the issuance of this memorandum, each covered agency shall identify opportunities to promote participation by diverse populations in advisory councils and stakeholder committees established to support public land or water management; environmental, public health, or energy development planning; and other relevant decisionmaking; and\n(vi) Develop an action plan. Within 1 year of the issuance of this memorandum, each covered agency shall provide a publicly available action plan to the Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality identifying specific actions the agency will take to 1) improve access for diverse populations—particularly for minority, low-income, and disabled populations and tribal communities—to experience and enjoy our Federal lands and waters, and 2) address barriers to their participation in the protection and management of important historic, cultural, or natural areas. Each covered agency shall identify in its action plan any critical barriers to achieving both of these goals. This barrier evaluation should draw on internal staff input as well as external perspectives, including interviews, surveys, and engagement with non-governmental entities, as appropriate and as resources allow. Each action plan should include specific steps that the covered agency will take to address identified barriers, including national as well as regional strategies, and, where appropriate, site-specific initiatives. Each covered agency should work through the Federal Recreation Council (FRC) to assist with the development of this action plan and use the FRC to share best practices and recommendations regarding specific programs and initiatives.\n(b) In identifying actions to improve opportunities for all Americans to experience our Federal lands and waters, each covered agency should consider a range of actions including the following:\n(i) Conducting active outreach to diverse populations—particularly minority, low-income, and disabled populations and tribal communities—to increase awareness about specific programs and opportunities;\n(ii) Focusing on the mentoring of new environmental, outdoor recreation, and preservation leaders to increase diverse representation in these areas and on our public lands;\n(iii) Forging new partnerships with State, local, tribal, private, and non-profit partners to expand access for diverse populations, particularly those in the immediate vicinity of a protected area;\n(iv) Identifying and making improvements to existing programs to increase visitation and access by diverse populations—particularly minority, low-income, and disabled populations and tribal communities; (v) Creating new programs, especially those that could address certain gaps that are identified;\n(vi) Expanding the use of multilingual and culturally appropriate materials, including American Sign Language, in public communications and educational strategies, including through social media strategies, as appropriate, that target diverse populations;\n(vii) Continuing coordinated, interagency efforts to promote youth engagement and empowerment, including fostering new partnerships with diversity- and youth-serving organizations and new partnerships with urban areas and programs; and\n(viii) Identifying possible staff liaisons to diverse populations, particularly those in the immediate vicinity of a given protected area.\n(c) In identifying actions to improve opportunities for all Americans to participate in the protection and management of important historic, cultural, and natural areas, each covered agency shall consider a range of actions including the following:\n(i) Considering recommendations and proposals from diverse populations to protect at-risk historic, cultural, and natural sites;\n(ii) Improving the availability and distribution of relevant information about ongoing land and water management planning and policy revisions;\n(iii) Identifying agency staff charged with outreach to diverse populations;\n(iv) Identifying opportunities to facilitate public participation from interested diverse populations facing financial barriers, including through partnerships, where appropriate, with philanthropic organizations and tribal, State, and local governments; and\n(v) Taking other actions to increase opportunities for diverse populations to provide input and recommendations on protecting, improving access to, or otherwise managing important historic, cultural, or natural areas, with an emphasis on stakeholders facing significant barriers to participation.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law, and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-12", "title": "Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Our National Parks, National Forests, and Other Public Lands and Waters"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121379", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:50 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Friday. TGIF, for one last time.\nQ: Friday, the 13th.\nMR. EARNEST: That's good luck.\nLet me do one, quick announcement before we get to your questions. Today the White House is hosting a transition exercise with current and perspective Cabinet members, agency heads and senior White House officials. The exercise provides an opportunity to familiarize members identified by the President-elect to fill senior administration positions on the authorities, policies, and coordination structures that this administration has used to respond to major domestic incidents. Cabinet members, agency heads and advisors in the current administration will share experiences and lessons from incident responses that they have led as they discuss a number of response scenarios together.\nThis exercise, which we announced back in November, advances the President's goal of conducting the most professional, seamless transition possible. We'll be in a position to provide some additional details at the conclusion of the meeting. You'll recall that an exercise like this was held in early 2009 between -- it was hosted by senior officials from the Bush administration and they invited their counterparts from the Obama administration at the time. And this is the next step in the process of ensuring a smooth and effective transition to the incoming administration.\nSo, with that, Darlene, want to get us started with questions?\nQ: Thank you. Is this an all-day sort of exercise?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not an all-day exercise. I know it's a multi-hour exercise. So it's ongoing as we speak, and I suspect that it will encompass a significant portion of everyone's afternoon schedule.\nQ: Is there any more detail you can provide on exactly what they're doing and how they're doing it? Are they breaking up into little groups and doing exercises? Are they doing policy and all things domestic?\nMR. EARNEST: The way that it's been described to me is that this is primarily a large-group exercise and will be an opportunity to discuss a variety of different scenarios, some related to domestic emergency response -- response to a natural disaster or a significant weather event, for example. But it also will include some foreign policy and national security exercises as well. And it will include both a review of responses that this administration has led to specific incidents, as well as exercises to walk through the options that are available in the context of a hypothetical event.\nQ: And what senior administration officials from this administration are participating?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll get you some additional information about the participants in the meeting once the meeting is concluded.\nQ: On another subject, will the President signed the waiver that's moving through Congress to allow General Mattis to serve as Defense Secretary?\nMR. EARNEST: I think we've indicated in the past that that's not something that the President would prevent from passing. So, yes, I think you can anticipate that if it did make it to the President's desk the he would sign it.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thanks. I want to follow up on the actions on Cuba yesterday, on the ending of \"wet foot, dry foot.\" I wasn't clear -- is this a move that can be overturned by the next administration? Realizing that it is the ending of a policy, but is this something that could easily -- they could come in and decide they want to put that policy back in place?\nMR. EARNEST: This policy change was codified in an executive agreement between the U.S. government and the government in Cuba. As even some of the incoming administration's nominees have noted, there's a tradition of subsequent Presidents observing and adhering to the executive agreements that were put in place by the previous President unless, of course, a specific decision is made to change the policy.\nSo, obviously, President-elect Trump will assume the awesome responsibilities of the American presidency on January 20th, one week from today. And he'll be able to exercise all of the executive authority that are invested in the presidency at his discretion. We believe that there is a strong case to be made about normalizing relations between our two countries, and this is just the latest step in that process to ensure that we are treating Cuban migrants the same way that we treat migrants from other countries. And that has a variety of benefits, including not providing an incentive for Cubans to attempt the very dangerous journey across the 90 miles of ocean that separate our two countries.\nSo I think the response to this announcement I think is indicative of how public opinion is changing on these issues, including in the Cuban-American community. And I noted the supportive comments of someone like Jorge Mas, who is the chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, somebody who is a leader in that community, obviously an influential voice. And his indication of support for this step I think is an indication of a growing majority of Americans who agree about the direction that the President has moved the relationship between the United States and Cuba.\nQ: Does the White House have any message to those -- I mean, there were -- there have been a number of stories done on people who were just at, like, the Mexican border trying to get across who had come from Cuba, made a very long, treacherous trip and were just there and just missed getting over before this policy was ended. Does the White House have any message for those people that were just there? I mean, some of these stories sound pretty heartbreaking.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the first thing that's important for people to understand is that the migrants from Cuba will be treated in the same way that migrants from other countries are, which is to say legitimate claims for refugee status or for asylum will be subject to due process, which means that their claims will be evaluated. And if they have legitimate claims for asylum, then that will be granted. But that will be adjudicated through the regular process that every other -- that migrants from other countries go through as well.\nAnd as we've talked a lot about immigration policy over the last several years, obviously the President believes strongly that the United States live up to our values as a nation of laws and as a nation of immigrants. And that means abiding by the law, but it also means showing respect and recognizing the humanity in people who are fleeing their home country. So this is -- and the policy change that we have announced ensures that we are harmonizing and normalizing our immigration policy with regard to Cuban migrants.\nQ: On one other topic, the head of the House Oversight Committee has threatened to subpoena the Office of Government Ethics -- the head of the Office of Government Ethics for his comments about Trump's conflicts of interest. Does the White House think it's appropriate for Congress to be looking into those comments from the Office of Government Ethics? Do they think that -- I mean, I think the comment from Chaffetz was that he felt like the head of the Office of Government Ethics wasn't behaving ethically when he was discussing Trump's conflicts. Does the White House have any thoughts about this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is the completion of the congressional Republicans' swamp-filling hat trick. They were able to get it done in two short weeks. You will recall that before congressional Republicans were even sworn into office their first act was to vote in secret to repeal the ethical regulations that applied to them. And it was only after an outcry from the public and a tweet from the President-elect that they reversed course.\nA week later we learned that Senate Republicans were prepared to roll back the standards that they'd insisted on for eight years when it came to making sure that nominees for executive positions had been fully vetted and fully complied with ethical requirements before they were given a hearing before the United States Senate and considered for their nomination. And Senate Republicans have famously walked that back, such that they are moving through the process nominees that haven't been subjected to the kind of scrutiny that they, themselves -- that Mitch McConnell himself had said was necessary.\nAnd now, to complete the hat trick, we've got the Republican Chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, the individual who, as much as anyone else in the United States Congress, is charged with providing oversight of the executive branch, is now seeking to intimidate a senior executive branch official who's responsible for enforcing ethics rules. He's threatening to shut down the office of the guy who is doing the job that Jason Chaffetz himself is refusing to do.\nIt's outrageous -- and I will say, only the latest installment in the embarrassing series of episodes that have characterized Jason Chaffetz's tenure as chairman of that committee.\nYou'll recall this is the guy who was charged with investigating government employees who were using personal email for government purposes at the same time that he's handing out his government business card with his personal email address on it. You can't make it up. This is the guy who led the investigation into Benghazi that the House Republican leader admitted was focused solely on politics and hurting Hillary Clinton's poll ratings.\nSo this is not some -- a departure from the series of embarrassing episodes that have characterized his tenure as chairman of the committee. And it certainly, as I've said before, runs contradictory to the preferences of the millions of Americans who showed up at the polls on Election Day and voted for the guy who is vowing to drain the swamp. Certainly it's going to make for an interesting relationship between the members of that committee, I suspect. And I think it will be worth watching -- particularly we'll be counting on all of you to watch the relationship between that committee and the incoming administration.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Speaking of outrage, House Democrats --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- after meeting with James Comey, and they expressed all kinds of emotions -- anger, concern, lost confidence, yes, outrage --\nMR. EARNEST: I think Washington psychiatrists are going to be doing a brisk business in the years ahead. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- some of them are saying that they have no confidence in the Director of the FBI at this point and that they don't feel like he's fit to do the job. I mean, hearing these strong words coming from Democrats -- I mean, we knew, obviously, some of that sentiment was there -- but at this point, Americans have heard anger and doubts coming from both sides related to the FBI and the intelligence community over the past couple of weeks. What are your thoughts on hearing this and the indication of deep problems that the American public now sees laid bare?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it is really important to make sure that we don't draw too many parallels between these two different situations. With regard to the handling of the investigation into Secretary Clinton by the Department of Justice and the FBI, for better or worse, we've spent a lot of time in this room talking about that matter -- not just in October, but, frankly, for a lot of the last two years. But when this came to a head in October, you often heard me describe the merits of abiding by the longstanding norms and traditions about the way the FBI conducts investigations and traditionally doesn't talk about those investigations in public.\nNow, as I said back in October, and I'll repeat again, the President does not at all believe that Director Comey was motivated by a desire to influence the outcome of the election. But there are longstanding norms and traditions that have served senior Department of Justice officials well over the years.\nNow, there's also -- as was announced yesterday by the Inspector General, there's now an independent investigation into this matter. And that certainly is going to limit the degree to which I can discuss it. That investigation was initiated at the sole discretion of the independent Inspector General. That's the way the process should work. And presumably, when he's got some findings to release, presumably he'll be in a position to do that publicly.\nWith regard to the situation with the intelligence community, I think it's different, because I think what you've heard from the intelligence community, including from Director Clapper in the statement that he released just a couple of days ago, is the intelligence community feels a strong responsibility to communicate to senior officials as much as possible about what they know, and as much as possible about the information that is available to them.\nNow, what Director Clapper also said in that statement is he expressed confidence that the intelligence community was not the source of those leaks. I verified for you before that the White House is not the source of those leaks. And I think all of that is an indication that both the intelligence community with regard to this matter and the White House with regard to this matter is following longstanding precedent and tradition and norms and guidelines that have served generations of White House officials and intelligence officials well.\nSo I think that that's why I would caution against drawing too many parallels between these situations. There are obvious similarities between these two cases, but there are certainly some places, as I just described, where the handling of these matters was different.\nQ: I think Comey, in his explanations, talked about how he felt the need to share information. He was choosing between two bad options, but he felt getting that information out there was the right thing to do at the time.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, but by getting it out there, briefing it to the President-elect, making sure that the President-elect himself was aware of the information that had come to the attention of the intelligence community. He stated in his statement that he could not at this point confirm the accuracy of the report, but I'll leave it to him and other intelligence officials to describe how they described this information to the President-elect.\nQ: Okay. And does it bother the administration that retired General Flynn was in contact with the Russian ambassador several times on the day that President Obama was sanctioning Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I've read some of these reports and I think, to answer your question as bluntly as I can, it depends on what he said. And I know that some members of the President-elect's transition team have tried to describe those conversations. Obviously, I have zero insight into what may have been communicated back and forth, so I'd refer you to General Flynn himself or spokespeople for the transition who may be able to provide additional insight into the nature of those conversations and why those conversations were initiated.\nQ: Okay. And you, today, and often you sort of list a long string of problems you have with behavior of Republicans in Congress over the last couple of years. But I wonder if everyday, average Americans who aren't in this industry or yours really know or care. I think maybe a lot of that falls on deaf ears. I don't know how much of that translates. And we just heard President Obama, in his latest interview, say that he feels that on some issues that he and his team lost the PR battle. So why do you think that is? Why do you think these things that you and he have been stressing as being so important, in some cases so important to democracy itself, they don't seem to matter?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as a substantive matter, they do make a difference. They do have a bearing on the strength and success of our democracy. But you're asking I think an entirely relevant question, particularly in light of the election outcome. Given the sordid record that Republicans have on some of these ethical matters, and have continued since the election, it raises questions about why that didn't influence the vote of more people. And I don't know that I can give you a real direct answer on that.\nI think that in some ways, the President addressed this in his speech on Tuesday night pretty directly. He said that it's a problem in our democracy when we excuse the ethical shortcomings of people in our own party but are ready to question the motives of people in the other party. He said it more eloquently than that, but you know the passage I'm referring to.\nI think the concern that I'm raising is about one of the basic functions of the United States Congress, which is to provide oversight. There have been a bunch of ethical questions that have been raised about some members of Congress, about some of the conflicts of interest that loom in the background of some of the nominations that the incoming administration has put forward. There are some people who fit both those categories. And the responsibility lies with all of you and with the United States Congress to resolve those questions.\nAnd the real problem I have right now is that there seems to be zero appetite among Republicans who were voted into office by people literally chanting \"drain the swamp\" for enforcing not tougher ethical regulations -- they're not even doing the basics. They're not even enforcing the minimum standards. They're trying to roll back those standards. They're voting to reduce the standards that apply to them. They're not applying the standards to Cabinet nominees that they have been applying for the last eight years. And in this case, the most egregious case, you have the person in the House of Representatives, who is most responsible for oversight, suggesting he's going to shut down the office of the independent ethical watchdog of the executive branch.\nSo, again, they're moving in the wrong direction. And those are all facts. I think it would be hard to contest any of this. Is it going to make a difference at the polling place the next time that people have an opportunity to vote for their elected representatives in Congress? I don't know. We'll see. But it does seem like Republicans are taking a pretty big risk, considering the \"drain the swamp\" chants at their pre-election rallies. To roll back those ethical standards within their first couple of weeks back in Washington I think does pose an electoral risk to them. And the last time that Democrats won the majority back from Republicans in the House of Representatives was prompted in no small part by a series of ethical transgressions on the part of congressional Republicans.\nBut, again, I think it's far too early to be making particularly specific prognostications about the 2018 elections. But we'll see.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple questions and primarily on justice issues. With the announcement today, kind of makes me go back to something with justice. The Justice Department put new federal officials on the case for Eric Garner. Do you believe there's still enough time left in this administration for some action to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw news reports about that. But I do not have -- as we've discussed in here many times, the White House is not briefed on these kinds of criminal investigations. Those investigative decisions, including determining which investigators will take a look at a particular case -- those are decisions that are made entirely by the Department of Justice without any influence or input from the White House.\nQ: Okay, I understand that, but do you still have time left -- yes, we have next week, but do we still have time left? Is there still enough time for things to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know at what stage they are in the investigation, so it's hard for me to assess how much more time they need in order to complete their investigation.\nQ: Okay. And lastly, several of President Obama's friends have had to do some prison time or jail time. And there's one in particular, Congressman Chaka Fattah -- there's a letter that has been sent to President Obama for a pardon. What does President Obama feel about pardoning some friends like Chaka Fattah? Jesse Jackson Jr. has not asked for a pardon, but what does he feel about that issue, about his friends asking for pardons and the possibility of pardons for those people?\nMR. EARNEST: I assume you're using \"friend\" in the broadest possible context.\nQ: Well, no, they were friends -- no, no, no, when I said -- but when I -- no, no, no. When I say \"friend,\" Chaka Fattah was a friend to this administration. I'm not saying that he was involved. I'm saying there were friends of the administration he was supportive --\nMR. EARNEST: He was a political supporter of the administration.\nQ: Right, as what --\nMR. EARNEST: And the President certainly appreciated his political support. But I think describing him as a friend might be going a little too far here.\nQ: And what about Jesse Jr. who was part of the campaign, who was a big part of the --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure it's fruitful for us to assess the President's relationship on an individual basis with all these people. But let me just get to the root of your question, which is simply that there is a process in place at the Department of Justice to evaluate petitions for clemency that are filed by individuals who are currently incarcerated or people that have a record that they're looking to clear. And the President established this process and has asked the Department of Justice to take the lead in considering these applications, to help process these applications as efficiently as possible and make individual determinations on the merits. And that's what the President expects the Department of Justice to help him do, and that's a standard that we have lived up to.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple for you. One, can you -- you've already been asked for more details about the exercise today, but I'm wondering if you can say now whether this is actual incidents that they're being walked through, or whether they're modeled on incidents that -- like, is there an Ebola crisis model? What exactly are they responding to?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is it's a little bit of both. And I'm sort of -- there's a reference to it in here. It will be a combination of both walking through hypothetical scenarios so that the incoming administration can get a sense of what procedures and mechanisms are in place, what resources are available for responding to these kinds of hypothetical incidents so that when a real one comes up they can have a sense of how the process typically works.\nBut they also will review in some detail real-live incidents that this administration did respond to, to help the incoming officials understand what lessons learned, what best practices we were able to implement to benefit the American people. So I guess the point is, it will be a little bit of both.\nQ: Will you be able to say, like, they looked at a Deepwater Horizon, they looked at an Ebola crisis, they looked at --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know how detailed our readout will be afterwards, but --\nQ: If we could request as detailed a readout as possible.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Okay.\nQ: And then Rex Tillerson has been to the White House many, many, many times. On any of those occasions, as far as you're aware, did he take a position with administration officials on the merits of sanctions involving Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that question, but I can see if we can try to get you an answer. As the leader of one of the largest companies in the United States, it certainly shouldn't be surprising to most people that he did come to the White House on a number of occasions to discuss with senior officials important issues that have an impact on our economy and our national security. But let me see if I can get you some kind of an answer to that question. We'll let you know.\nSteven.\nQ: Josh, does the President have a reaction to the Department of Justice report on Chicago that there's a pattern of practices of discrimination and unjustified use of deadly force?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about the specific report. I know that this was an inquiry that was initiated at the discretion of the Attorney General. These kinds of investigations are conducted independently, and the conclusions were put forward based on their own independent analysis of what exactly has been happening in Chicago with regard to the local police force there.\nThe President does believe that the Department of Justice, as a matter of principle, can play a useful role in helping uncover facts that can then be used to begin to restore trust and faith and confidence in local law enforcement, particularly among those communities that feel as if they're -- the concerns that they have raised have gone unheard; that surfacing them in the context of these kinds of investigations can be useful in all sides designing the kinds of strategies that would rebuild trust in a way that makes these communities safer, but also makes these police officers more safe as they try to do their dangerous work, as well.\nThese are men and women, the vast majority of whom are doing this dangerous job for all the right reasons. These are men and women who are genuinely interested in fighting crime. They're interested in the public interest. They're focused on trying to keep people safe. And they've got an extraordinarily difficult job. And if there is something that we can do to make their job just a little bit safer, then we should be looking for ways to do that.\nAnd the President's hope is that the effective professional, genuinely independent investigations that get to the bottom of some of the root challenges that are facing some of these law enforcement agencies -- that does have the effect of restoring a little trust in making the work that police officers do every day just a little bit safer.\nQ: There are some police officers who have said -- high-ranking law enforcement officials who have said that the scrutiny that's applied on police agencies is leading to -- a Ferguson effect. Does the President share that concern? I guess particularly in Chicago.\nMR. EARNEST: The President, when he's been asked about this in the past, has indicated that he hasn't seen any evidence to support that hypothesis. And I think some of it goes to the argument that I was making, which is that the vast majority of men and women in uniform who put on the blue every day, who go out there to put their lives on the line to keep us safe, are motivated much more by their genuine interest in public safety than they are in covering their own behind, if you will. And to be totally blunt about it, I think it speaks to their character.\nI think there is a reason that people have put forward this hypothesis. And I think there is a reason that a number of law enforcement officers and leaders have taken some umbrage at that suggestion, because they see the men and women under their command at work every day, and they recognize that they're putting their lives on the line, intervening in dangerous situations to try to protect the public, try to protect public safety, to live up to their motto \"To serve and protect.\" And they do that even in the face of some of these other -- an environment in which their job is as complicated as it's ever been.\nAnd, again, I think that's a pretty powerful illustration of the character of the vast majority of the American men and women who serve our country as law enforcement officers.\nRon.\nQ: Does the President see a connection between the challenges, as you put it, that the department faces and the spike in murders, violent crime in Chicago?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this goes to the same question. I think it's difficult to assess exactly what that relationship is. I think the President's view is that if the local law enforcement agency has an effective working relationship with the diverse community of the city of Chicago -- I should say the diverse communities of the city of Chicago -- they'll be more effective in fighting crime. They'll also be safer as they do that important work.\nAnd so that's why the President believes it's a worthy goal for us to work in a direction that I know that Mayor Emanuel advocates. And I know that he's put in some reforms and structures to try to address this basic challenge, and I know that his administration has worked to cooperate with the Department of Justice to try to get to the root of some of these problems and try to design some solutions that would address them.\nQ: I ask because the bigger question is, to what extent are the problems in the police department contributing to the crime problem in the city? And I ask because obviously a lot of people in law enforcement would disagree with any notion that that is contributing to the problem. And the next step in their argument might be that this is another indication of the President not supporting law enforcement, as he has been accused of in the past and as you're well aware of.\nMR. EARNEST: Falsely and wrongly, but, yeah.\nQ: That's why I'm just trying to see if the President sees any connection between problems identified by this DOJ investigation and the spike in murders, specifically.\nMR. EARNEST: And, again, I think the President's view is that if we can get to the root of some of these challenges, we can certainly make law enforcement more effective at protecting the rights of every citizen in their community, even as they aggressively fight crime and keep all the citizens of that community safe.\nQ: The other thing is, the President talked to you about this losing the PR battle in the 60 Minutes interview, and he specifically mentioned his inability to get a hearing for Judge Garland. I'm wondering what other issues out there does he think it was largely a question of not PR but swaying public opinion, or bringing public opinion to bear on the Republicans or on the nation's psyche to get something done. For example, he talks about the inability to get common-sense gun laws passed. Is that another issue where he feels that his inability to get public opinion on his side was the determining factor? Or is there something else out there that was more -- caused it? But I know, again, it's hard to sort out what caused what, so on and so forth -- beyond Garland, what else was he referring to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's important to differentiate between public opinion and mobilizing the public. So, for example, when it comes to things like common-sense gun safety measures, closing a gun show loophole, closing the loophole that allows an individual who is on the no-fly list from walking into a gun store and buying a gun -- those are measures that have the strong support of a majority of Americans, a majority of Republicans, a majority of Democrats, a majority of gun owners. Those are common-sense measures. And the fact that they are common-sense measures is evidenced, at least in part, by the fact that there is common agreement around the country that these would be good things for the Congress to do.\nSo I don't know if people needed to be persuaded about the notion of common sense. But what clearly didn't happen is there was not a successful mobilization of the American people around that common sense to get Congress to act. And the President has been deeply frustrated by that.\nAnd I think that would -- and I think the Garland nomination would actually fall in that same category, because I think if you take a look at sort of the public view of that situation, the vast majority of Americans didn't have any objections to Chief Judge Garland, which is notable because Republicans didn't really have any substantive objections to him, either -- other than the fact that he was nominated by a Democratic President.\nQ: Okay. So the question is, to what extent is it the inability to mobilize public opinion as sort of a tactical thing, versus misreading public opinion and misreading what's really out there in terms of what people want in terms of gun safety or Judge Garland, or I don't know -- any other range of --\nMR. EARNEST: Immigration reform I think would be another --\nQ: Yes, exactly.\nMR. EARNEST: Right? Because again, there was strong -- there's a strong coalition of Democrats, Republicans, law enforcement, religious leaders, faith leaders, business community who support the kind of common-sense immigration reform that this administration pursued and that this administration worked effectively with Republicans in the Senate to pass. But it was House Republican leaders who got together to block it.\nSo I think the other element of all this, Ron, is the widespread and damaging dysfunction that Republicans have imposed on the United States Congress. That strategy of essentially political sabotage was something that did apparently work for them politically, but it was bad for the country. Some of these common-sense steps are things that would be good for the country, and everybody agrees that they would be. Immigration reform would have lots of obvious economic benefits.\nQ: Right, but on immigration reform, there's a lot of people who also want to build a wall. And it seems like there's more of them out there, based on the outcome of the election, than those who fall in the other category --\nMR. EARNEST: Not when you consider that Secretary Clinton got 3 million more votes. So, again -- and not when you consider that Democratic candidates for Congress got more votes than Republican candidates for Congress.\nSo I think what we're illustrating here is I do think that there is a risk of oversimplifying this and saying, well, you know, if you just convinced more people. That's not actually what it is. The solution to breaking through this dysfunction is more complicated than that. And this is a proposition we're going to test because I don't think -- we'll see -- I don't think, however, that it's possible to rely solely on dysfunction and sabotage as your organizing, governing principle when your party is in charge of both houses in Congress and the White House.\nQ: But what the President seems to be saying is that he believes that he is on the right side on so many of these issues --\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely.\nQ: -- and that the reason that he didn't prevail was more tactical than right or philosophical.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what's true about a number of the things --\nQ: Republicans would argue, well, no, you're not. You don't quite understand the country on immigration, or on guns, or on the inability of --\nMR. EARNEST: If there are people who are, indeed, saying that, I think those are people that don't -- that aren't familiar with some basic principles of math, because there is ample public opinion data to indicate at least on the handful of things that we've discussed here -- investments in infrastructure, investments in immigration -- or progress on immigration reform, common-sense gun safety -- there are strong majorities of Americans that agree with the President's position on this.\nBut, look, here's the other disconnect. Despite the fact that the administration was advocating for those policies that have the strong support of the American public, at least some of those Americans -- despite the fact that they agree with the President on all of those measures -- voted for somebody who doesn't. And that I think is more complicated than just public relations.\nI think there's an element of it that relates to a political strategy, a set of obstruction tactics that were implemented by Republicans. And I think some of it has to do with how effective the Democratic Party is in communicating with those who aren't regularly inclined to agree with Democrats.\nSo I think there's a lot to sift through here. And some of it actually goes back to the thing that Michelle raised, which is these are issues where people say that they agree with the administration, or the position that's been put forward by the President, but they don't appear to care. And does that raise questions about the way that some of these issues are covered in the media? It might. But I think that there's a lot of this that we're going to have to spend some time thinking about. And I think you can be assured that the President, in his post-presidential life, will be thinking about these issues and looking for ways to solve them.\nQ: And just last one. Are you going to do a week-ahead or almost week-ahead? Full week-ahead? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I will do a week-ahead.\nQ: And sort of on that, can you tell us anything about Friday and the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll have some additional details on that, and we'll do that at the end and look at the schedule.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, a quick follow-up on the tabletop exercise. I missed the beginning of it. I just want to clarify, the transition team -- not the actual incoming staff -- but the transition team witnessed a tabletop practice in December, right?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. So that was the December exercise. This January exercise that's taking place today -- it's ongoing as we speak -- includes some of the individuals who have already been named to senior White House positions. And in some cases, it includes individuals who have been nominated for Cabinet positions, even though they have not yet been confirmed.\nQ: And they're actually conducting it.\nMR. EARNEST: They're actually participating in the exercise, yes.\nQ: And just to use that for Inauguration Day -- because of the 2009 threat on Inauguration Day, and the importance of having the outgoing staff here until noon with the incoming, and the meetings that took place that morning, can you just tell us who will be here on the President's staff up until noon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that our staff will be structured in a way to ensure this continuity of government even through the day in which the handover takes place. So I can follow up with you with more details about how we'll be staffed here at the White House. I would not anticipate a significant presence of Obama White House staffers here on the 20th just because the incoming administration will be moving in. But there will be officials who will be available.\nQ: Will Denis wait until noon?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the individual plans of staffers. I'm not sure exactly what Denis has planned.\nShana, nice to see you.\nQ: Thanks for having me. I wanted to follow up on the question earlier about the call between the Russian ambassador and Flynn. So, first, could you let me know if the White House was informed of this call at all? And secondly, I'm just trying to get a sense of how usual or unusual it would be to have someone from the incoming administration, before they've been sworn in, contacting the Russian ambassador or any sort of officials. Did anything like that happen during the Obama transition period? Is this typical or unusual at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can say as a general matter, on principle, you can imagine why these kinds of interactions may take place, why the incoming national security advisor may have the need to contact the representative of a foreign government that's based here in Washington, D.C. But as I mentioned to Michelle, it depends on what they discussed. It depends on what he said, in terms of whether or not we would have significant objections about those conversations.\nYour previous question about whether or not the White House was informed in advance -- I'm not aware that we were informed in advance if he intended to make the call. I'll check on that. And if I'm wrong about that, we'll correct it. But I'm not aware that we were informed in advance of the call.\nQ: So something like, as the Trump administration characterized it, \"Merry Christmas, let's get in touch after the Inauguration, let's set up those logistics\" -- that would be normal transition business?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it sounds like it to me. But again, I can't pass judgment on the content of the conversation because I obviously wasn't privy to it.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, a follow on that. Has the White House had any contact or inquired about the nature of any of these conversations?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the conversations that have taken place between White House officials and General Flynn's office. And even if I were aware of the details of that, I probably wouldn't discuss them here.\nSo obviously what I can tell you is, with regard to White House communications with the Russian ambassador, other than a White House staffer reaching out to the Russian embassy here in Washington to offer condolences on the death of the Russian diplomat in Turkey a month or so ago, I'm not aware of any conversations, at least in this period of time, around the holidays and around the work to develop and issue the response to Russia's malicious cyber activity earlier this year -- or in 2016.\nQ: But I guess the reason all of this timing and the timeline becomes important is getting to the heart of what you're saying, is it depends on what they said during that conversation. Refresh my memory: Did the White House brief the Trump team about the sanctions before they were rolled out on the 29th?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that they were briefed on the sanctions. I don't know that they were necessarily briefed in advance.\nQ: So if there was a conversation on the 28th, that wouldn't necessarily raise a red flag to you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I guess I can't speak to everything that General Flynn may or may not have known. So again, I think I'll let him describe what he knew at the time that he engaged in a conversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\nQ: Do you find, I mean, the line of questioning, I guess the questions being raised generally fair, having gone through a transition yourself? I mean, technically speaking, there's nothing to prohibit contact for an incoming NSA and a sitting ambassador, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I think that's the point that I was trying to make with Shana, that as a general matter, I don't think there's anything wrong, on principle, of an incoming national security advisor having basic contact with the representative of a foreign country before taking office -- or at least the representative of that foreign country in Washington before taking office.\nBut the whole situation is rather unique, right? I'm not sure that we've ever had a transition in which the intelligence community concluded that a foreign country made a conscious effort to try to advantage one presidential candidate. So the fact that the designated national security advisor, who has his own rather remarkable relationship with the Russian government -- the fact that that official was in touch with the Russian ambassador to the United States, I can understand why that was the subject of a column in the newspaper today.\nQ: When you said it depends on what he said, you're leaving the door open that there was something to truly question in terms of the motivations, the content of their conversations.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm saying is that I don't know the content of their conversations and I can't raise an objection without knowing the content of their conversations. I'm also not prepared to say it was entirely appropriate without knowing the content of their conversations. I just don't know, and it just depends.\nQ: And when you said the last contact between the White House and the Russian diplomat here in Washington was around --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, let me try to be slightly more precise here. This was the only contact between the White House and the Russian ambassador during this period of time in which the response to Russia was being finalized and was rolled out the last week in December. What I do not know is whether or not there have been additional conversations between the White House and the Russian embassy after the first of the year, for example -- or at least since that report was -- since our response was announced.\nBut obviously, it was a sensitive time in this several-week period in which this response was being finalized. So obviously there were not a lot of conversations other than this expression of condolence to the Russian government and to the Russian people for the assassination of the Russian diplomat in Turkey. And that's not something that we talked about in this room because that's an event that took place when we were not doing regular briefings over the holidays, but that was the assassination of a diplomat on foreign soil. And despite our profound differences with Russia on a range of issues, that's a genuine tragedy. And the expression of condolence that was made through a staffer here at the White House was genuine, and certainly our heart goes out to the families of -- to the family of that diplomat that was killed in Turkey.\nQ: And when you're talking about contact, you're just talking about the White House. You're not talking about John Kerry and Sergei Lavrov speaking?\nMR. EARNEST: Correct. I can't speak to conversations --\nQ: Or other government contacts.\nMR. EARNEST: Correct. I can't speak to conversations that may have taken place between State Department officials, for example, and the Russian embassy or other Russian diplomats.\nJohn.\nQ: You talked about this process about presidential clemency. I just wanted to dive into that just a little bit. Today, WikiLeaks had a tweet that indicated that Julian Assange would agree to U.S. extradition if Chelsea Manning was granted a commutation of her sentence. There's also a petition out there that calls for the pardon of Edward Snowden; it has over a million signatures. I'm wondering if those sorts of extraneous factors have any sort of bearing at all on the President's decision when he ultimately decides on these cases.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that the Department of Justice and the President will consider individual clemency applications on their merits. And there are obviously a wide range of factors that the President and the Department of Justice will consider. And I think to illustrate one of them would be to illustrate the pretty stark difference between Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.\nChelsea Manning is somebody who went through the military criminal justice process, was exposed to due process, was found guilty, was sentenced for her crimes, and she acknowledged wrongdoing. Mr. Snowden fled into the arms of an adversary, and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our democracy.\nSo I think the situation of these two individuals is quite different. I can't speculate at this point about to what degree that will have an impact on the President's consideration of clemency requests. But I know that there's a temptation because the crimes were relatively similar to lump the two cases together. But there are some important differences, including the scale of the crimes that were committed and the consequences of their crimes.\nObviously, as Chelsea Manning has acknowledged, and as we have said many times, that the release of the information that she provided to WikiLeaks was damaging to national security. But the disclosures by Edward Snowden were far more serious and far more dangerous.\nQ: Just one quick question, a follow-up on that. Does the Department of Justice come forward with a recommendation on each case to recommend to the President? Or does he ultimately take that with heavy weight? Or how does it work?\nMR. EARNEST: The Department of Justice does administer a process where they will review factors about each case individually. They'll do so based on the merits, and they will provide a recommendation to the President. And I think you would expect the President would very carefully consider the recommendation that's made by the Department of Justice before making a final decision.\nQ: And then yesterday, at the end of the briefing, you were asked about these photographs that TMZ got ahold of where it was apparent that the First Dog, Sunny, bit a guest here at the White House. Were you able to follow up on that at all and find out if that was true?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a whole lot more to -- more light to shed on that particular situation. I think what I can say is both Bo and Sunny have been genuine ambassadors to the American people. (Laughter.) Thousands of people have had an opportunity to interact, play with those dogs, pet with those dogs -- as you have, my son has, I have.\nQ: I heard April say over my shoulder that this has happened before. Are you aware that the dogs have -- either of the dogs have bitten --\nQ: No, it was Barney. It was Barney.\nQ: Barney, okay.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that that's happened before. And I think that they have represented themselves and our country quite well in their status as the First Dogs. (Laughter.)\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Did the President by chance have an opportunity to watch to Speaker Ryan last night? He was part of an interesting public conversation about the Affordable Care Act. Did the President take in any of that, by chance?\nMR. EARNEST: The President did not watch that last night.\nQ: I ask because one of the suggestions that was made in the conversation was that rather than sort of hang on to a program that's apparently in a death spiral, as it has been described by some, with decreasing --\nMR. EARNEST: Not by economists, I'd point out.\nQ: By some. Decreasing choices and increasing premiums, rather than sort of hang on to that, why not repeal it -- even if the process of replacing it takes longer than perhaps they would like? What do you think about that notion?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's a dangerous proposition. As a Republican congressman said, that's them loading the gun without knowing where it's pointed. It's dangerous. It's going to have impact on lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans. If Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, they're going to take away health care from 30 million Americans. They're going to take away protections from 130 million Americans that, because of the Affordable Care Act, currently cannot be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. Those protections are removed if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nQ: What if they repeal it and expand Medicare and Medicaid in the process? Wouldn't that sort of, at least temporarily, cover those who might be impacted while they work on the sort of --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, let me compliment you for doing much more than any Republican on Capitol Hill has done. (Laughter.) You've actually put forward an idea. You've actually put forward a specific idea that we can evaluate and we can see what impact that would have on our health care system. Republicans have refused to do that. Republicans are saying that they'll get around to putting forward a replacement at some point in the future, despite the fact they've been saying that for seven years now. They haven't put forward a plan. There's no evidence that they can actually come together around a plan to replace it.\nWhat the President has said is that if Republicans actually are willing to put forward good ideas, including potentially expanding Medicaid or increasing tax credits for people to make the purchase of health insurance on the Marketplace even more affordable, those are good ideas and those are ideas that the President and Democrats in Congress would have been and will, I think in the future, be happy to work with Republicans to implement because it would have the effect of strengthening the Affordable Care Act, expanding further access to health care coverage, and reducing costs for middle-class families. Those are all good things. But that's not what Republicans have proposed. And that's not what Paul Ryan proposed.\nWhen Paul Ryan came face to face with one person who would be very negatively affected by the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the best he could do was reiterate chewed-over, debunked, politically motivated talking points that may have tested well in focus groups but were not at all satisfying to the millions of Americans whose lives will be put at risk if Republicans follow through on their promise.\nQ: Let me ask you about the AG's discovery and ultimately her decision about the situation in Chicago. Is it fair to say that, ultimately, the buck stops with the mayor -- in this case, the President's good friend -- and I use that expression because I know that's a friend.\nMR. EARNEST: That is true.\nQ: Rahm Emanuel.\nQ: They're really friends?\nQ: Yeah, they're really friends.\nMR. EARNEST: They are.\nQ: They are.\nQ: Would it be fair to say the buck stops with him? And how disappointing would that be, as someone who not only knows him well but has affinity for that city, that they were unable, at least at this point, to get a handle on what was obviously something that was happening within the police department?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Kevin, I haven't read the Department of Justice report, but I am confident that it will say that the challenges that were uncovered, the problems that were uncovered in the police department have been in place for a long time. And having heard Mayor Emanuel talk about these issues, it is clear that his interest in solving those problems is genuine. He's got an authentic interest in trying to address some of these very thorny challenges, because he recognizes -- in the same way that the President does -- that the men and women of the Chicago Police Department are safer and are going to be more effective at fighting crime, and the communities that they patrol will be safer if the breach in trust that has erupted in the last few years between some of the communities in Chicago and the Chicago Police Department can be repaired.\nThose repairs are not going to happen overnight. You don't build trust with somebody overnight. You build trust with somebody over time, particularly when you're talking about an institution as large as the Chicago Police Department and when you're talking about neighborhoods that are as large and as populated as some of the communities in Chicago.\nSo it's going to take some time. And what's going to be required is people like Mayor Emanuel stepping up and showing the kind of leadership that he has for the last several years in making these reforms a priority and making getting to the truth a priority, and genuinely engaging in the kind of work that is hard, is not glamorous, and, in some cases, may not be politically popular in order to get at the crux of these problems. And I think -- that's why I know that President Obama is proud of the leadership that Mayor Emanuel has shown and is counting on him to continue to show it so that the Chicago Police Department and the entire city can continue to make progress in the right direction.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two questions. First, you and the President have noted from this podium historic firsts. Does the administration have any comment at all about the news last night that Vice President-elect Mike Pence has selected Justice Clarence Thomas to administer the oath of office to him, and that that will make him the first black American ever to swear in one of the top two officials in U.S. history?\nMR. EARNEST: I was not aware of that announcement from Vice President-elect Pence, but obviously Justice Thomas, for all of our profound differences when it comes to some pretty important basic American values, he is somebody who has had a genuinely historic career. And I think this is just the latest evidence of the historic nature of the position that he holds, and I think it's also reflective of the political philosophy of Vice President-elect Pence that he would choose Justice Thomas to administer the oath. But obviously that was a decision that was left up to him.\nQ: Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy spoke yesterday, and he addressed some of the concerns about taking time to come up with an alternative to the Affordable Care Act. And what he said is that they, Republicans, would be criticized in the past if they rushed into a plan, and that by taking their time and considering things they were going to get it right this time. I'm paraphrasing the Majority Leader.\nMR. EARNEST: Right.\nQ: Do you have a response to that, or a comment?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll try to keep this one short. Seven years seems like a really long time to me.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Official Chinese media today warned U.S. if it is denied access to the artificial islands in the South China Sea. This follows after a few hearings on the Hill. What do you have to say on this?\nMR. EARNEST: I think this is an allusion to some comments that were made by Mr. Tillerson, the gentleman that President-elect Trump has designated to serve as -- or has nominated -- been nominated to serve as Secretary of State. I would refer you to Mr. Tillerson's team for an explanation of what exactly he was trying to convey in his remarks.\nI can tell you that the policy that's been in place in the Obama administration has been to not take sides in the competing land claims in the South China Sea. Certainly, the United States doesn't have any claims to any territory in that region of the world. And what we have suggested is that those with competing claims should seek to resolve those competing claims not through brute force or through intimidation or coercion, but rather through diplomacy and negotiation.\nAnd that is something that we have encouraged all parties to do. And I don't know whether or not that will be the policy of the incoming administration. I assume that will be one of the topics that will be covered in first briefing that you guys have in here with my successor. But that's the policy that's been in place in this administration.\nQ: The Asia Pacific pivot was one key aspects of the President's foreign policy. Do you feel that it might be dumped in the Pacific in the new administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Can you repeat the first part of your question one more time?\nQ: The Asia Pacific pivot was one of the key aspects of the President's foreign policy.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it was. Again, I can't speak to what foreign policy priorities will be pursued by the incoming administration.\nQ: Did it serve as value?\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, I think the interests of the United States of America were advanced in important ways with the commitment of this administration to strengthening our alliances in the Asia Pacific and looking for ways to expand economic opportunity for the American people in the Asia Pacific.\nOf course, this administration did complete the trade agreement with the Republic of Korea, something that does deepen our ties with our allies in South Korea. It also expands economic opportunity for American businesses that are looking to get access to South Korean markets.\nNow, what we advocated and what President Obama dedicated a significant portion of his presidency to doing was negotiating a Trans-Pacific Partnership. This would be a trade agreement with 11 other countries, where the United States would be able to work effectively to level the playing field and impose higher and enforceable labor and environmental standards, enforceable and higher human rights standards, protections for things like intellectual property that would give U.S. businesses access to some of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nThe benefits of the policy include slashing 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods and services. But unfortunately, Congress did not take action on the agreement that the Obama administration negotiated. And that's unfortunate because early indications are that other countries are prepared to move forward without the United States.\nThat's going to put U.S. businesses and the U.S. economy at a disadvantage. It means that other countries' products are going to be cheaper for some countries to import. And that's going to put U.S. businesses at even greater disadvantage. So it's a very difficult case for opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership to make that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have a negative impact on our economy.\nThe fact is this would have followed through on a number of the President's promises, including renegotiating NAFTA in a way that has positive benefits for the U.S. economy for American businesses and for American workers.\nSo the President believes that the interests of the United States were well served by our policy of rebalancing our attention to Asia, but there certainly is more that can and should be done. But we'll have to see what the incoming administration chooses to do.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, already at the start of this year, there are a number of proposals in state legislatures that seem to enable discrimination against LGBT people, including measures in Texas, Virginia, and Kentucky that would bar transgender people from using the restrooms consistent with their gender identity. You've spoken against measures along these lines at your time from the podium. Is it incumbent upon the Trump administration to speak out against these measures as well as they move forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the first observation I would make is I'd encourage the leaders of those states that you named to consult with outgoing North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory about whether or not that's a particularly smart political idea. I'm not sure that it is.\nI would also encourage them to contact the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce to determine whether or not the state of North Carolina benefitted economically from implementing these policies. They did not when you consider the business decisions that were made by not just high-profile organizations like the NCAA and the NBA, but also other businesses that were looking to expand their footprint, and expand their business in that state. They chose not to do so because they were concerned that their employees and their customers were at heightened risk of being discriminated against.\nSo obviously these states, because of our system of government, have an opportunity to pass and implement laws as they see fit. But they might consider the experience of the state of North Carolina before they do so.\nQ: I know what you think. But it is incumbent upon the person who --\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't really kept it a secret, have I?\nQ: Yes. (Laughter.) Is it incumbent upon the person who takes the podium after you to make a similar case?\nMR. EARNEST: The incoming administration is going to be responsible for what they choose to advocate for. I've always been proud to stand at this podium and advocate for fairness and justice and equal treatment of every single American. I think the incoming administration will have to determine if they're going to do the same thing.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I'm curious about this change in policy as it relates to Cubans that make it to U.S. shores. Was there any effort by the administration to consult with, reach out to, give a heads up to the Trump transition team or President-elect Trump as it relates to this policy?\nMR. EARNEST: There was an effort, a successful effort, to brief the incoming administration shortly before this policy change was made public.\nQ: And give me a sense, if you could, about the reaction coming from the Trump transition team once you gave them an effort to let them know about this policy change.\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let the incoming administration describe their reaction to this policy change.\nQ: Talk a little bit about the timing here. It comes eight days before a new administration takes over and will then be in charge of immigration policy. Was there any thought about, do we do this now? It's so soon before the next administration takes over and will be in charge of immigration policy.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, it takes time to negotiate these kinds of executive agreements, particularly with a country like Cuba that does not have a long history of negotiating these kinds of agreements with the United States. For more than 50 years, the United States pursued a policy of diplomatic isolation with Cuba. And so it's only over the course of the last year or so that we've had the kind of diplomatic opening that will allow us to have these kinds of conversations. So, negotiating these kinds of executive agreements takes time, but as soon as this agreement was completed, we announced it right away.\nQ: President-elect Trump, I think it was in late November, took to Twitter to talk about what he called the deal that has been reached between the U.S. government and the Cuban government. And essentially, he threatened that he may undo it once he becomes President. Is that a concern of this administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, if he wants to cancel this policy, he'll be cancelling $6 billion of increased exports and financial ties between the United States and Cuba.\nQ: It's all about the financial relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's relevant. He certainly seems to be motivated by financial interests in some pretty important ways; he has over his professional career. So I think he'll find that argument persuasive, particularly when you consider that there were reports that his company was negotiating with Cuba for exactly those kinds of agreements. So he obviously recognizes the economic opportunity that's there. There's more than a hundred flights every day between the United States and Cuba. That's cancelling a lot of flights if he wants to roll back this policy. And I can't imagine that the U.S. airline industry is going to be particularly pleased by that kind of development.\nThere are thousands of Americans that have an opportunity to travel to Cuba, and they've had an opportunity to enjoy their time there, learn a little bit more about the country, enhance ties between our two countries, and they've been able to return to the United States with all of the cigars and rum that they could pack into their suitcase if they choose to. I don't think those Americans are going to be particularly pleased to see that policy rolled back.\nQ: In that answer you failed to mention -- that long answer -- you failed to mention --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm happy to go on. (Laughter.) So I will.\nQ: Please do.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what we also know is that the Cuban people genuinely support this policy.\nQ: -- human rights. Can you talk about that issue as it relates to the Cuban people? Because you talk mainly about the economic benefits that will --\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned, I could go on.\nQ: -- the Cuban government.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm happy to go on. And I think what we have found is that for 50 years, more than 50 years, there was a policy of diplomatic isolation in place that had no material impact in improving the human rights situation in Cuba. If anything, it got worse. This policy has been in place for about a year. And is there more that we would like to see the Cuban government do with regard to protecting human rights? We absolutely would. But our view is that the ability of the United States to advocate for those kinds of improvements is enhanced when we deepen the ties between our two countries. When there are more Americans that are traveling to Cuba, when there is more communication going back and forth between Cuba and the United States, when there are more Cuban Americans that have an opportunity to visit family and send money to family in Cuba, all that is going to promote freedom. That's going to promote our values.\nAnd what we've also succeeded in doing is removing an impediment to our relationship with countries throughout Latin America that have important relationships with Cuba. For most of the last 50 years, those countries in Latin America didn't apply that much pressure to Cuba about their human rights situation, and were focused on the United States and our failed policy of trying to isolate them. Now that that impediment has been removed, it's not just the United States that's encouraging the Cuban government to improve their human rights situation, but you've got countries throughout the Western Hemisphere that are making the same argument. So all we have done is to increase pressure on the Cuban government to improve the human rights situation there, and, at the same time, the merican people have enjoyed a number of material benefits, including monetary benefits, that I do think will be persuasive to the incoming President as he determines what policy he believes is best with regard to the United States and Cuba.\nQ: Do you think there has been an improvement in human rights in Cuba since the policy change?\nMR. EARNEST: Not nearly as much as we would like to see. But the policy has been in place for a little over a year. So let's give it another 50 years and see where it ends up.\nGoyal.\nQ: Thank you, sir. Two questions. One, as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned, President Obama has been dealing with two Indian Prime Ministers -- Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and now Prime Minister Modi. And he became the first U.S. President to visit India twice during his administration. And many members of the Indian-American community will miss him, and of course, some of us will miss you. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Wow. Goyal is getting all sentimental here. It's not even my last day. Mark chooses not to associate himself with your remarks. (Laughter.) That's very kind of you, Goyal. Thank you.\nQ: Thank you. So the relations have been great between U.S. and India under this administration and of course, in relations to India. My question is that what is the future of -- can you highlight some of the policies during this administration and what you think the future will be between the two countries, and what you think the new President will have for the new administration.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama has recognized the opportunity that exists with India to deepen our security, economic and diplomatic relationship. And the President believes that doing that successfully allows the United States to advance our interest not just in Asia but around the world. And President Obama is proud of the success that we have had in doing exactly that.\nThere are important economic benefits for the American people. There obviously are important security benefits in that region of the world as two of the world's largest democracies get together and work together to advance the interests of peace-loving countries like our two countries.\nWith regard to the future, that's something that the incoming administration will have to speak to. But President Obama had an opportunity during his eight years in office to chart a course that he believes benefitted the citizens of the United States and India.\nQ: And second, as far as the press relations are concerned between President-elect Trump press relations and also you think -- what advice do you think the President will have -- President Obama for President-elect as far as press relations are concerned, or what President-elect believes or might be thinking that press who are not favoring him or was against him? And also, any advice for upcoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, who is not a new face in the White House or in this town?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I had an opportunity to meet with Mr. Spicer at the beginning of last week. We had a nice conversation. My colleague, Jen Psaki, who has got a lot of experience working here at the White House, spent a long time talking to him about the opportunity to work here and talked to him a little bit about the logistics of running a White House press office, but also some of the things that he can do to prepare himself to do the important work, standing behind this podium and representing the interests of not just the administration but of the country.\nAnd both of us, in private and as I've done publicly, I wish him well and will be hoping for his success as he manages the relationship between the White House and the White House Press Corps and as he seeks to advocate for the best interests of the United States.\nWith regard to advice that the President has given the President-elect, as we've discussed in here a few times, the President and President-elect had an opportunity to consult on the telephone a number of times since they met in person in the Oval Office back on November 10th. But I'm going to protect their ability to have a private conversation.\nQ: One on the new relations, please?\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, last one.\nQ: Yes, sir. Thank you. Still so many people are waiting and see that if there is a light in the dark tunnel for them under Obama administration. What is the future of -- because many of them are living under the prospect of working under -- so what do you think is for them, what is their future?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's hard for me to speak to the future because there's an incoming administration who will set their own agenda and pursue the priorities that they have identified. But President Obama certainly recognized that there is an important opportunity for us to reform our broken immigration system. And we did work to develop a proposal that was supported by a number of Republicans in the United States Senate that would bring people out of the shadows and prevent people from taking advantage of them because of their status, and also asking them, after undergoing a background check and paying taxes -- giving them a path to citizenship.\nThat is consistent with the United States of America being a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. That's a policy that reflects the views of a broad majority of the American public. But we'll have to see what this Congress and the next administration chooses to pursue.\nYes, sir.\nQ: My country, Canada, and yours, the United States, share common igloos in the Northern Arctic, and we've heard a word bandied about -- some very wonderful interviews by with Barack Obama -- \"hope.\" What kind of hope do you have for environmental and natural habitat issues in the Arctic?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau have been able to work quite effectively together to safeguard some of the most beautiful places in the world in the Arctic. Obviously both the United States and Canada are Arctic nations, and being able to work together to safeguard some of those areas is an important legacy of President Obama. And I know that President Obama is hopeful that Prime Minister Trudeau will continue to look for ways to make efforts to protect the Arctic and fight climate change a top priority. And I can't speak for the incoming administration, but I would expect that -- well, what I will say is that President Obama is hopeful that Prime Minister Trudeau will continue to make those issues a priority.\nQ: (inaudible) -- the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it remains to --\nQ: -- denying the issues of environmental changes and the things that are taking place there. Are you --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we have found and certainly what President Obama has found over his eight years in office is that we can make tangible, important progress in protecting the planet by working closely with other countries. And the United States has played a leading role in doing exactly that.\nThe United States brokered an agreement with China that really mobilized the international community and convinced individual countries to make their own commitments to reduce carbon pollution in a way that has had a tangible, positive impact on the diplomatic track, in terms of making commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nThat's good for the country. It's good for the planet. It's also good for our economy, because the United States does stand at the forefront of many of the technologies that other countries we'll have to invest in, in order to keep their promises. And so whether that's a company -- a U.S. company like Westinghouse that builds nuclear reactors, or if it's smaller American companies that are at the forefront of wind energy technology or at the forefront of solar technology or at the forefront of energy efficiency technology, countries now around the world will be turning to that kind of technology in order to meet the commitments that they have made.\nSo by enforcing these commitments and by continuing to lead the international community to make these commitments, President Obama has created a real economic opportunity. And hopefully those are the kinds of policies that will be continued and the full benefits will be enjoyed.\nI'll give you the last one, sir, and then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: It isn't your last day, but it is your last week. I'd love to hear your own self-criticism, what you think you could have done better on the job; what you think we could have done better. And finally, Chiefs and Steelers -- what's your --\nMR. EARNEST: I thought you would never ask. (Laughter.) With regard to -- we'll get to that. With regard to my own performance, I'm confident that we could spend a decent amount of time every day underscoring aspects of my presentation that could have been improved.\nThe one thing that I feel good about having done is I succeeded in being consistently honest. I succeeded in understanding the President's point of view and doing my best to accurately describe it to all of you and to the American public. And I've shown a genuine interest in and respect for the role that all of you play in holding people in power accountable. That's critical to the success of our democracy. You all have dedicated a significant portion of your lives to doing exactly that, and I certainly hope that it continues.\nWith regard to assessing your performance, it's not my first day here -- I'm not going to fall into that trap. (Laughter.) So there is a healthy separation between the United States government and the independent media that covers us, so I'll leave it to all of you to assess your own performance and to look for ways to play your important role in our democracy even better.\nWith regard to --\nQ: Gold, silver, or bronze -- you, Gibbs and Carney? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let you award the medals.\nWith regard to the football game this weekend, I'm really looking forward to it. The Chiefs have not won a home playoff game since 1994, so to say that the Chiefs are due is an understatement. But as I recall, that game that they won in January of 1994 was against the Steelers. Look, what I do think is if the defense can make some stops and even slow down that potent Pittsburgh offense, then I think the Chiefs stand a good chance.\nQ: -- on that regard?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't want to jinx it, but I will be watching with interest.\nQ: Week ahead?\nMR. EARNEST: Let's do the week ahead. Darlene seems as interested in the football game as I am. (Laughter.)\nOn Monday, Martin Luther King Day, the President will welcome the Chicago Cubs to the White House to honor that team and their 2016 World Series victory. Later that day, the President will participate in a service project to mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Wednesday, the President of the United States will host his final news conference as President of the United States here in the briefing room. It will be in the afternoon, but we'll get you a specific time next week.\nQ: East Room?\nMR. EARNEST: It will be in this room.\nOn Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Friday morning, President Obama and the First Lady will welcome President-elect Trump and Melania Trump to the White House for tea and a small reception. Then, per custom, President Obama and President-elect Trump will motorcade up to the United States Capitol together.\nThe President and First Lady will attend the inaugural swearing-in and inaugural address of President-elect Trump, and then depart the United States Capitol via helicopter, as other Presidents have done in recent years. At that point, President Obama and the First Lady will proceed to Joint Base Andrews, where he will deliver remarks to a group of staff that will be gathered there to bid farewell. And then he and Mrs. Obama will depart Joint Base Andrews on their last flight aboard the presidential aircraft to a destination to be announced.\nQ: Are those staff remarks open? Or pooled?\nMR. EARNEST: There will be some pool coverage of the President's remarks to staff at Joint Base Andrews.\nQ: White House staff?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it will be both the White House staff and staff from across the administration.\nQ: Are you briefing Tuesday?\nMR. EARNEST: Tuesday I will do a briefing and it will be, as you could tell from the schedule, my final briefing at the White House as well.\nQ: It better be great.\nMR. EARNEST: Bring your hankies. (Laughter.)\nQ: No, you need to bring your hanky. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I will not brief on Thursday. On Thursday, I anticipate that will be a quiet day of packing. (Laughter.)\nQ: Are you going to miss this?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. Can't you tell? (Laughter.)\nQ: You're going to miss us.\nMR. EARNEST: I will.\nQ: No, I'm serious.\nMR. EARNEST: I am -- we'll have an opportunity to talk about this on Tuesday.\nFrancesca, do you have the last one here?\nQ: Did you say what he's doing this weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has a public schedule this weekend.\nHave a good weekend, everybody.\nEND 2:23 P.M.

Mrs. DeVos has a real compassion for children and a proven record of championing reforms to improve literacy and learning in our nation. I am confident that she will provide the leadership we sorely need to raise the bar on education in America and provide better opportunities for our most vulnerable students.\n...\nBetsy DeVos has helped pass reforms to drive gains in literacy. The Great Lakes Education Project she founded in Michigan was instrumental in passing a comprehensive reading law last year that provides extra tutoring to struggling students and other intervention strategies to ensure that kids are leaving third grade with the literacy skills they will need to succeed in later grades. Reading is truly the building block of a successful education, and Mrs. DeVos has fought hard to ensure that elected officials in her home state and across the nation are giving literacy its proper attention.\n....\nI also believe Mrs. DeVos has the right priorities on important issues such as school choice, early childhood development and accountability in education. I have worked with Mrs. DeVos' advocacy organizations for years and I know that her commitment to children runs deep. She believes passionately that children should have access to high performing schools regardless of their race, income or zip code. That is why she has fought valiantly to give parents of at-risk children the right to send their kids to charter and private schools when the public school system is letting them down.\n...\nI believe Mrs. DeVos is an educator at heart. She is a woman who has dedicated much of her adult life to fighting some really tough battles on behalf of our nation's school children, including mentoring children for decades in her home state of Michigan. There are powerful forces in our education system that are resistant to change. Mrs. DeVos has the courage to do the thing for parents and their children.\nI know Betsy DeVos is the right woman to help usher in an era of education reforms that can drive significant improvement in student achievement. She has a big heart, a strong backbone and she wants to serve in Washington for only one reason: to make a difference in the lives of America's school children. We need more people like Mrs. DeVos in our nation's capital. She is the type of leader and reformer who can bring positive and lasting change to America's classrooms.", "timestamp": "2017-01-13", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Barbara Bush: DeVos Should be Confirmed Secretary of Education"}

And all of Trump's first week of nominees seem headed toward confirmation.\nSeven Trump picks — Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions, Homeland Security Secretary-designate John Kelly, Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson, Transportation Secretary-designate Elaine Chao, Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis, Housing and Urban Development Secretary-designate Ben Carson, and CIA Director-designate Mike Pompeo — faced Senate committees this week. The number included three of the so-called Big Four cabinet positions — Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense. (A hearing for the fourth of the Big Four, Treasury Secretary-designate Stephen Mnuchin, has not yet been scheduled.)\nSome of the hearings went so well that press accounts declared them a \"lovefest.\" Chao's hearing certainly qualified, as did Kelly's. Others, like Mattis's, were smooth and businesslike. Still others, like Sessions', ended up being far less adversarial than expected, either because Democratic attacks lacked energy and focus, or the nominee was able to deftly handle the situation, or both.\n...\nChao's hearing consisted largely of the nominee and Republican and Democratic senators all expressing high regard for each other.\n...\nMattis's hearing included much praise of his competence and qualifications, followed by a broadly bipartisan 24-3 committee vote approving a measure to give Mattis a waiver for a law that would have barred him, as a retired general, from serving now as Defense Secretary. The full Senate went on to approve the waiver 81 to 17.\n...\nAnd in its first week of tests on Capitol Hill, the new administration came out the winner.", "timestamp": "2017-01-13", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Washington Examiner's Byron York: \"On Capitol Hill, Trump Wins Week One\""}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on January 19.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121382", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nWhen the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shared his dream with the world atop the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he gave mighty voice to our founding ideals. Few could have imagined that nearly half a century later, his iconic profile would forever be memorialized in stone, standing tall and gazing outward, not far from where he stirred our collective conscience to action. In summoning a generation to recognize the universal threat of injustice anywhere, Dr. King's example has proven that those who love their country can change it.\nA foot soldier for justice and a giant of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King lifted the quiet hopes of our Nation with the powers of his voice and pen. Whether behind his pulpit in Montgomery, at a podium on the National Mall, or from his jail cell in Birmingham, he beckoned us toward justice through non-violent resistance and oratory skill. Dr. King fought not merely for the absence of oppression but for the presence of opportunity. His soaring rhetoric impelled others to take up his cause, and with struggle and discipline, persistence and faith, those who joined him on his journey began to march. America was watching, and so they kept marching; America was listening, and so they kept sounding the call for justice. Because they kept moving forward with unwavering resistance, they changed not only laws but also hearts and minds. And as change rippled across the land, it began to strengthen over time, building on the progress realized on buses, in schools, and at lunch counters so that eventually, it would reverberate in the halls of government and be felt in the lives of people across our country.\nThose who dismiss the magnitude of the progress that has been made dishonor the courage of all who marched and struggled to bring about this change—and those who suggest that the great task of extending our Nation's promise to every individual is somehow complete neglect the sacrifices that made it possible. Dr. King taught us that \"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of convenience and comfort, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\" Although we do not face the same challenges that spurred the Civil Rights Movement, the fierce urgency of now—and the need for persistence, determination, and constant vigilance—is still required for us to meet the complex demands and defeat the injustices of our time. With the same iron will and hope in our hearts, it is our duty to secure economic opportunity, access to education, and equal treatment under the law for all. The arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice, but it only bends because of the strength and sacrifice of those who reject complacency and drive us forward.\nAs we reflect on Dr. King's legacy, we celebrate a man and a movement that transformed our country, and we remember that our freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of others. Given the causes he championed—from civil rights and international peace to job creation and economic justice—it is right that today we honor his work by serving others. Now more than ever, we must heed his teachings by embracing our convictions. We must live our values, strive for righteousness, and bring goodness to others. And at a time when our politics are so sharply polarized and people are losing faith in our institutions, we must meet his call to stand in another person's shoes and see through their eyes. We must work to understand the pain of others, and we must assume the best in each other. Dr. King's life reminds us that unconditional love will have the final word—and that only love can drive out hate.\nOnly by drawing on the lessons of our past can we ensure the flame of justice continues to shine. By standing up for what we know to be right and speaking uncomfortable truths, we can align our reality closer with the ideal enshrined in our founding documents that all people are created equal. In remembering Dr. King, we also remember that change has always relied on the willingness of our people to keep marching forward. If we do, there is no mountaintop or promised land we cannot reach.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2017, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service projects in honor of Dr. King and to visit www.MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-13", "title": "Proclamation 9568—Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2017"}

This idea of religious liberty later became a foundation for the First Amendment, which begins by stating that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" On Religious Freedom Day, we rededicate ourselves to defending these fundamental principles, pay tribute to the many ways women and men of different religious and non-religious backgrounds have shaped America's narrative, and resolve to continue forging a future in which all people are able to practice their faiths freely or not practice at all.\nReligious freedom is a principle based not on shared ancestry, culture, ethnicity, or faith but on a shared commitment to liberty—and it lies at the very heart of who we are as Americans. As a Nation, our strength comes from our diversity, and we must be unified in our commitment to protecting the freedoms of conscience and religious belief and the freedom to live our lives according to them. Religious freedom safeguards religion, allowing us to flourish as one of the most religious countries on Earth, but it also strengthens our Nation as a whole. Brave men and women of faith have challenged our conscience and brought us closer to our founding ideals, from the abolition of slavery to the expansion of civil rights and workers' rights. And throughout our history, faith communities have helped uphold these values by joining in efforts to help those in need—rallying in the face of tragedy and providing care or shelter in times of disaster.\nAs they built this country, our Founders understood that religion helps strengthen our Nation when it is not an extension of the State. And because our Government does not sponsor a religion—nor pressure anyone to practice a particular faith or any faith at all—we have a culture that aims to ensure people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely and proudly worship without fear or coercion. Yet in 2015, nearly 20 percent of hate crime victims in America were targeted because of religious bias. That is unacceptable—and as Americans, we have an obligation to do better.\nIf we are to defend religious freedom, we must remember that when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up. At times when some try to divide us along religious lines, it is imperative that we recall the common humanity we share—and reject a politics that seeks to manipulate, prejudice, or bias, and that targets people because of religion. Part of being American means guarding against bigotry and speaking out on behalf of others, no matter their background or belief—whether they are wearing a hijab or a baseball cap, a yarmulke or a cowboy hat.\nToday, we must also remember those outside the United States who are persecuted for their faith or beliefs, including those who have lost their lives in attacks on sacred places. Religious liberty is more than a cornerstone of American life—it is a universal and inalienable right—and as members of a global community, we must strive to ensure that all people can enjoy that right in peace and security. That is why my Administration has worked with coalitions around the globe to end discrimination against religious minorities, protect vulnerable communities, and promote religious freedom for all. We have also worked to ensure that those who are persecuted for their religious beliefs can find safety and a new home in the United States and elsewhere.\nAmerica has changed a great deal since Thomas Jefferson first drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, but religious liberty is a right we must never stop striving to uphold. Today, let us work to protect that precious right and ensure all people are able to go about their day in safety and with dignity—without living in fear of violence or intimidation—in our time and for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2017, as Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that teach us about this critical foundation of our Nation's liberty, and that show us how we can protect it for future generations at home and around the world.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-13", "title": "Proclamation 9569—Religious Freedom Day, 2017"}

Biden, Jr., President of the Senate.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121364", "text": "Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)\nConsistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the \"order\") that revokes sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, and revokes Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, in its entirety. Both actions are effective 180 days from January 13, 2017, provided that certain further action is taken by the Secretary of State on or before that date. I have determined that the situation that gave rise to the actions taken in those orders related to the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan has been altered by Sudan's positive actions over the past 6 months. These actions include a marked reduction in offensive military activity, culminating in a pledge to maintain a cessation of hostilities in conflict areas in Sudan, and steps toward the improvement of humanitarian access throughout Sudan, as well as cooperation with the United States on addressing regional conflicts and the threat of terrorism.\nThe President issued Executive Order 13067 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, including support for international terrorism; efforts to destabilize neighboring governments; and the prevalence of human rights violations. Section 1 of Executive Order 13067 blocks the property and interests in property of the Government of Sudan, and section 2 prohibits a broad range of trade and investment-related transactions with Sudan, including imports from and exports to Sudan. The President expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006, which blocks the property and interests in property of certain persons in connection with the conflict in Darfur. The President took additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 in Executive Order 13412 due to policies and actions of the Government of Sudan that violated human rights, in particular with respect to the conflict in Darfur, and the pervasive role played by the Government of Sudan in the petroleum and petrochemical industries in Sudan. Executive Order 13412 continues the blocking of the Government of Sudan, specifies new prohibitions relating to Sudan's petroleum industry, and exempts certain specified areas in Sudan from the trade prohibitions found in Executive Order 13067.\nWith the positive steps taken by the Government of Sudan over the last 6 months, and provided that these positive actions are sustained over the next 180 days, there will be no further need for sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 or for Executive Order 13412. The 180-day delay period of the order's effective date with respect to removing these provisions is intended to encourage the Government of Sudan to sustain its efforts in these areas. The order directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and based on a consideration of relevant and credible information from available sources, including nongovernmental organizations, on or before July 12, 2017, to provide a report to the President on the Government of Sudan's progress in sustaining the positive actions taken by the Government of Sudan that gave rise to the order, including carrying out the Government of Sudan's pledge to maintain a cessation of hostilities in conflict areas in Sudan; continuing improvement of humanitarian access throughout Sudan; and maintaining its cooperation with the United States on addressing regional conflicts and the threat of terrorism. As much of the report as possible shall be unclassified and made public. Provided that the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, publishes on or before July 12, 2017, a notice in the Federal Register stating that the Government of Sudan has sustained the positive actions that gave rise to the order and has provided to the President the report described above, the revocation of sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the revocation of Executive Order 13412 will become effective. The national emergency the President declared in Executive Order 13067 will remain in place, as will Executive Order 13400.\nThe order further directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, to provide to the President an updated version of the report described above annually thereafter and, concurrent with those reports, to publish in the Federal Register a notice stating whether the Government of Sudan has sustained the positive actions that gave rise to the order. As much of the annual reports as possible shall be unclassified and made public. In addition, to the extent an annual report concludes that the Government of Sudan has or has not sustained the positive actions that gave rise to the order, the order directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, to provide to the President recommendations on appropriate U.S. Government responses.\nFor these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to revoke sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and to revoke Executive Order 13412 on July 12, 2017, provided that further action is taken by the Secretary of State, as set forth in the order. Consistent with this determination, I have waived in the order the application of section 908(a)(1) of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7201-7211) with respect to Sudan, and sections 6(a) and (b) of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004, as amended (Public Law 108-497).\nI am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. The order is effective on January 13, 2017, except for sections 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the order, which are effective on July 12, 2017, provided that further action is taken by the Secretary of State as set forth in the order.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-13", "title": "Letter to Congressional Leaders on Recognizing Positive Actions by the Government of Sudan and Providing for the Revocation of Certain Sudan-Related Sanctions"}

The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy.

On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 12959, imposing more comprehensive sanctions on Iran to further respond to this threat. On August 19, 1997, the President issued E.O. 13059, consolidating and clarifying the previous orders. I took additional steps pursuant to this national emergency in E.O. 13553 of September 28, 2010, E.O. 13574 of May 23, 2011, E.O. 13590 of November 20, 2011, E.O. 13599 of February 5, 2012, E.O. 13606 of April 22, 2012, E.O. 13608 of May 1, 2012, E.O. 13622 of July 30, 2012, E.O. 13628 of October 9, 2012, and E.O. 13645 of June 3, 2013.\nOn July 14, 2015, the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the European Union, and Iran reached a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful. January 16, 2016, marked Implementation Day under the JCPOA, when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued a report verifying that Iran had completed key nuclear-related steps as specified in the JCPOA, and the Secretary of State confirmed the report's findings. As a result, the United States lifted nuclear-related sanctions on Iran consistent with its commitments under the JCPOA, including the termination of a number of Executive Orders that were issued pursuant to this national emergency. While nuclear-related sanctions were lifted pursuant to our JCPOA commitments, a number of non-nuclear sanctions remain in place.\nSince Implementation Day, the IAEA has repeatedly verified, and the Secretary of State has confirmed, that Iran continues to meet its nuclear commitments pursuant to the JCPOA. However, irrespective of the JCPOA, which continues to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful, certain actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2017. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in E.O. 12957. The emergency declared by E.O. 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by E.O. 12170.

The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries caused a deterioration in the security of Libya, posed a serious risk to its stability, and led me to declare a national emergency to deal with this threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\nThe Government of National Accord (GNA), which was established through the Libyan-led and U.N.-facilitated Libyan Political Dialogue, has sought to bolster its support in Libya but continues to face obstacles from spoilers and hardliners. The House of Representatives in eastern Libya, which the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) stipulates should function as the GNA's legislature, continues its attempts to compete with, rather than work with, the GNA. GNA-aligned forces, backed by air strikes and intelligence support from the U.S. military, successfully ousted the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from Sirte; however, ISIL and other terrorist groups continue to pose a threat to Libyan stability as well as U.S. and allied interests outside Libya. Recent clashes between militias highlight the continued threat of violence in Libya and the potential for renewed fighting over the country's resources, and we run the risk of further destabilization if sanctions do not remain in effect.\nWe continue to encourage all Libyans to engage in dialogue and cease violence. Those that reject dialogue and obstruct and undermine Libya's democratic transition must be held accountable, which is why we worked with the U.N. Security Council to pass United Nations Security Council Resolution 2174 in August 2014 to address threats to Libya's peace, security, and stability. In December 2015, we also worked with the U.N. Security Council to pass United Nations Security Council Resolution 2259 in order to welcome the signing of the LPA and to demonstrate international support for Libya's political transition process. We will continue to work with the international community to identify those individuals that pose a threat to Libya's democratic transition and ensure that the appropriate sanctions remain in place.\nThe situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and we need to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuse by certain members of Qadhafi's family and other former regime officials.

It was an opportunity to say thank you. Whether we've seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people—in living rooms and schools, at farms and on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts—all these conversations are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.\nOver the course of these 8 years, I've seen the goodness, the resilience, and the hope of the American people. I've seen neighbors looking out for each other as we rescued our economy from the worst crisis of our lifetimes. I've hugged cancer survivors who finally know the security of affordable health care. I've seen communities like Joplin rebuild from disaster and cities like Boston show the world that no terrorist will ever break the American spirit.\nI've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I've mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and I found grace in a Charleston church. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch and our wounded warriors walk again. I've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. I've learned from students who are building robots and curing diseases and who will change the world in ways we can't even imagine. I've seen the youngest of children remind us of our obligations to care for our refugees, to work in peace, and above all, to look out for each other.\nThat's what's possible when we come together in the slow, hard, sometimes frustrating, but always vital work of self-government. But we can't take our democracy for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the work of citizenship. Not just when there's an election, not just when our own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life. If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, then grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.\nOur success depends on our participation, regardless of which way the pendulum of power swings. It falls on each of us to be guardians of our democracy, to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great Nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title: citizen.\nIt has been the honor of my life to serve you as President. Eight years later, I am even more optimistic about our country's promise. And I look forward to working along your side, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\nThanks, everybody. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-14", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

The United States and Cuba have reached more than a dozen arrangements to expand cooperation in areas such as health, medical research, agriculture, environmental cooperation, hydrography, marine protected areas, counternarcotics, civil aviation, and direct transportation of mail.\nThe goals of the President's Cuba policy have been simple: to help the Cuban people achieve a better future for themselves and to advance the interests of the United States.

[Laughter] Here is something none of my predecessors ever got a chance to say: Welcome to the White House the World Series Champion Chicago Cubs!\nNow, I know you guys would prefer to stand the whole time, but sit down. [Laughter]\nI will say to the Cubs: It took you long enough. I mean, I've only got 4 days left. You're just making it under the wire. [Laughter]\nNow, listen, I made a lot of promises in 2008. [Laughter] We've managed to fulfill a large number of them. But even I was not crazy enough to suggest that during these 8 years we would see the Cubs win the World Series. But I did say that there's never been anything false about hope. [Laughter] Hope, the audacity of hope.\nAudience member. Yes, we can!\nThe President. Yes, we can.\nAudience members. Yes, we did!\nAudience member. Yes, we will!\nThe President. Now, listen, for those of you from Chicago who have known me a long time, it is no secret that there's a certain South Side team that has my loyalty. [Laughter] For me, the drought hasn't been that—as long. We had the '85 Bears; we had the Bulls' run in the nineties. I've hosted the Blackhawks a number of times. The White Sox did win just 11 years ago with Ozzie and Konerko and Buehrle. So I can't claim that I have the same just visceral joy of some in this White House. [Laughter]\nBut FLOTUS is a lifelong Cubs fan. And I will tell you, she had to go to another event, but in the 8 years that I've been here—I told the team this—in the 8 years that I've been here, we've hosted at least 50 teams: football, basketball, baseball, soccer, you name it. Michelle has never come to a single event celebrating a champion until today. And she came and shook hands and met with every one of these members of the Cubs organization and told a story about what it meant for her to be able to see them win, because she remembers coming home from school, and her dad would be watching a Cubs game, and the bond and the family, the meaning that the Cubs had for her in terms of connecting with her father and why it meant so much for her. And I almost choked up listening to it. And it spoke, I think, to how people feel about this organization, and that it's been passed on generation after generation, and it's more than just sports.\nAnd that is not just true for FLOTUS. My longest serving aide, Anita, is a Cubs fan. [Laughter] \"Fan\" is not enough. When they won, the next day she said, this is the best day of my life. [Laughter] And I said, what about me winning the Presidency? What about your wedding day? She's, like, \"No, this is the best.\" My chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan—[applause]—Cubs fan. In fact, there were a lot of sick days during the playoffs. [Laughter] One of my staff members was caught being interviewed at a bar outside of Wrigley—[laughter]—and we're watching him being interviewed. You remember, Luke? And he's looking kind of sheepish about it. It's, like, why aren't you in the office? [Laughter]\nBut look, the truth is, there was a reason not just that people felt good about the Cubs winning. There was something about this particular Cubs team winning that people felt good about. For example, David Ross and I have something in common: We've both been on a \"year-long retirement party.\" [Laughter] But unlike \"Grandpa,\" my team has not yet bought me a scooter with a motorized golf caddy. But there are 4 days left. Maybe I'll get that. [Laughter]\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, Teddy Roosevelt was President. Albert Einstein and—or was it Thomas Edison—was still alive. The first Cubs radio broadcast wouldn't be for almost two decades. We've been through World Wars, cold war, a depression, space race, all manner of social and technological change. But during that time, those decades were also marked by Phil Cavarretta and Ernie Banks; Billy Williams, who's here today; Ron Santo, Ferg, Ryne Sandberg, Dawson, Maddux, Grace. Those decades were punctuated by Lee Elia's rants and Harry Caray's exuberance: \"Hey, Hey\" and \"Holy Cow\" and capped off by \"Go Cubs Go.\" [Laughter]\nSo the first thing that made this championship so special for so many is, is that the Cubs know what it's like to be loyal and to persevere and to hope and to suffer and then keep on hoping. And it's a generational thing. That's what you heard Michelle describing. People all across the city remember the first time a parent took them to Wrigley or memories of climbing in their dad's lap to watch games on WGN—and that's part of the reason, by the way, why Michelle had invited—made sure that José Cardenal was here, because that was her favorite player. And she was describing, back then, he had a big afro, and she was describing how she used to wear her hat over her afro the same way José did.\nYou could see all that love this season in the fans who traveled to their dads' gravesites to listen to games on the radio, who wore their moms' old jerseys to games, who covered the brick walls of Wrigley with love notes in chalk to departed fans whose lifelong faith was finally fulfilled.\nNone of this, of course, would have happened without the extraordinary contributions of the Ricketts family. Tom met his wife Cece in the bleachers of Wrigley about 30 years ago, which is about 30 years longer than most of relationships that begin there last. [Laughter] Just saying. [Laughter] Our dear friend Laura Ricketts met her wife Brooke in the ballpark as well.\nBrothers and sisters, they turned this team around by hiring what has to be one of the greatest, if not—I mean, he's still pretty young, so we'll see how long he keeps on going—the greatest general managers of all time, Theo Epstein—[applause]—and along with Jed Hoyer and Jason McLeod. They did just an unbelievable job. Theo, as you know—his job is to quench droughts: 86 years in Boston, 108 in Chicago. He takes the reins of an organization that's wandering in the wilderness, he delivers them to the Promised Land. [Laughter] I've talked to him about being DNC chair. [Laughter] But he's decided wisely to stick to baseball.\nThat brings me to the other thing that was so special about this championship, and that's just the guys behind me, the team. They steamrolled the majors this year with a 103-win record. All you had to know about this team was encapsulated in that one moment in Game 5, down three games to one, do or die, in front of the home fans, when David Ross and Jon Lester turned to each other and said, \"I love you, man.\" And he said, \"I love you too.\" [Laughter] It was sort of like an Obama-Biden moment right there. [Laughter] And then, you've got the manager, Joe Maddon, who—[applause]—let's face it, there are not a lot of coaches or managers who are as cool as this guy. Look how he looks right now. [Laughter] That's cool. That's cool. He used costume parties and his \"Shaggin' Wagon.\" [Laughter] So he's got—I'm just saying—he's got a lot of tricks to motivate. But he's also a master of tactics and makes the right move at the right time: when to pinch hit, when to pinch run, when to make it rain—[laughter]—in Game 7 of the World Series. That was—it was masterful. So he set the tone, but also some of the amazing players here set the tone.\nMy fellow \"44\"—Anthony Rizzo, who—the heart of this team. Five years ago, he was a part of the squad that lost 101 games. He stuck at it and led the National League in All-Star votes this year.\nHis business partner in the \"Bryzzo Souvenir Company,\" which delivers baseballs to fans in all parts of the bleachers: Kris Bryant. Now—where's Kris? This guy had a good year. [Laughter] You go from Rookie of the Year to being the MVP. You win the World Series. And then, like me, he marries up and comes to the White House. And he did all this just in 10 days. [Laughter] I mean, it took me a long time. So congratulations to the newlyweds, Jessica and Kris Bryant.\nAnd then, you've got these young guys like Bàez and Russell: Bàez turning tagging into an art form; Russell becoming the youngest player to hit a World Series Grand Slam since Mickey Mantle. And you mix these amazing young talents with somebody like David Ross who, for example, helped Anthony out of his \"glass case of emotions\" in Game 7. [Laughter] But think about what Rossie did in his final season: caught a no-hitter, surpassed a hundred home runs for his career, including one in his last game ever. If there was ever a way to go out, this was it.\nAnd then, you've got Ben Zobrist, who didn't get to come to the White House last year after winning it all with the Royals, but then hits .357 in the World Series, go-ahead RBI in the 10th inning of the Game 7, World Series MVP. I think he's earned his way here. So—[applause]. Hey! And is apparently a good guy, because I asked his wife—she was in line before he was—and I said, has he gotten a big head since he got the whole MVP thing? \"No, he's so sweet, he's so humble.\" [Inaudible] You owe her dinner tonight. [Laughter]\nExtraordinary pitching staff, including Kyle Hendricks, the first Cub to lead the majors in ERA since 1938. Kyle, in turn, was the only pitcher this year with a better ERA than Jon Lester, who racked up 19 wins. Good job. Jake Arrieta, 2015 Cy Young Award winner, stretched a 20-game win streak featuring two no-hitters across the past two seasons, then hit a home run in the NLDS, and won two games in the World Series. So apparently Pilates works. [Laughter] Michelle says it does.\nSo—and then, finally, the game itself and the series itself. To come back from a 3-1 deficit against a great Cleveland Indians team forced what is widely considered the Game 7 of all time. Dexter Fowler becomes the first player to hit a leadoff home run in Game 7. Javy Bàez hits another leadoff the fifth. David Ross becomes the older player—oldest player to knock one out in a Game 7 as well. Kyle Schwarber, who's been hurt and hobbled, then suddenly, he comes in and gets seven hits in the Series, three in Game 7 alone.\nAnd then, you've got the 10th inning, you've got the rain. [Laughter] God finally feeling mercy on Cubs fans. [Laughter] An entire game, an entire season, an entire century of hope and heartbreak all coming down to a one-inning sprint. And then, Zobrist knocked in one, Montero knocked in another. Carl Edwards, Jr., and Mike Montgomery teamed up to shut the Indians down. And then, at 12:47 a.m. Eastern Time, Bryant—it looks like he's going to slip; everybody is getting a little stressed—tosses a grounder to Rizzo. Rizzo gets the ball, slips it in his back pocket—[laughter]—which shows excellent situational awareness. [Laughter] That was impressive. And suddenly, everything is changed. No more black cats, billy goats, ghosts, flubbed grounders. The Chicago Cubs are the champs. And on ESPN, you've got Van Pelt saying, \"One of the alltime great nights.\" You've got Tim Kurkjian calling it \"the greatest night of baseball in the history of the game.\" Two days later, millions of people—the largest gathering of Americans that I know of—in Chicago. And for a moment, our hometown becomes the very definition of joy. So, in Chicago, I think it's fair to say, you guys will be popular for a while. [Laughter]\nBut, in addition, they're also doing a lot of good work. Anthony Rizzo and Jon Lester raised money to help others beat cancer like they did. Under the Ricketts family's leadership, last year alone, Cubs Charities supported charitable grants and donations of nearly $4 million that reached nearly 120,000 children and young adults across Chicagoland. Under their \"Let's Give\" initiative, Cubs staff, coaches, players, and spouses donated more than 1,500 hours of service last year to the community. And after their visit here today, they will head to Walter Reed to visit with some of our brave wounded warriors.\nSo just to wrap up, today is, I think, our last official event—isn't it?—at the White House under my Presidency. And it also happens to be a day that we celebrate one of the great Americans of all time, Martin Luther King, Jr. And later, as soon as we're done here, Michelle and I are going to go over and do a service project, which is what we do every year to honor Dr. King. And it is worth remembering—because sometimes, people wonder, well why are you spending time on sports; there's other stuff going on—that throughout our history, sports has had this power to bring us together, even when the country is divided. Sports has changed attitudes and culture in ways that seem subtle, but that ultimately made us think differently about ourselves and who we were. It is a game, and it is celebration, but there's a direct line between Jackie Robinson and me standing here. There's a direct line between people loving Ernie Banks and then the city being able to come together and work together in one spirit.\nAnd I was in my hometown of Chicago on Tuesday, for my Farewell Address, and I said, sometimes, it's not enough just to change the laws, you've got to change hearts. And sports has a way, sometimes, of changing hearts in a way that politics or business doesn't. And sometimes, it's just a matter of us being able to escape and relax from the difficulties of our days, but sometimes, it also speaks to something better in us. And when you see this group of folks of different shades and different backgrounds and coming from different communities and neighborhoods all across the country and then playing as one team and playing the right way and celebrating each other and being joyous in that, that tells us a little something about what America is and what America can be.\nSo it is entirely appropriate that we celebrate the Cubs today, here in this White House, on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday because it helps direct us in terms of what this country has been and what it can be in the future.\nWith that, one more time, let's congratulate the 2016 World Championship Chicago Cubs! Good job! [Applause] Good job!\nPresident of Baseball Operations Theo N. Epstein. Talk about a tough act to follow. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for inviting us. We're all honored to be here today, and we appreciate you taking the time on such an important day, Martin Luther King Day, and during such an historic week, the last week of your distinguished Presidency. I was told on my way in here—actually, by our club historian—it's actually not the first time this franchise has visited the White House. It was 1888. [Laughter] And we were known as the Chicago White Stockings, and we stopped in here to visit President Grover Cleveland. And apparently, the team demanded to—for a proclamation to be named the best baseball team in the country. The President refused, and the team went on their way. [Laughter] And so here we are; we're going to make no such demands today. [Laughter] But we appreciate those kind words.\nThe President was so kind to recognize our three Hall-of-Famers here with us today who are so synonymous with what it means to be a Cub: Billy Williams, Fergie Jenkins, Ryne Sandberg. [Applause] Thank you for being here. And of course, José Cardenal, who got the longest hug from the First Lady we've ever seen, her favorite player of all time, you're the MVP today. [Laughter]\nAnd I want to, one more time, recognize all of the Ricketts family who are here today. Tom, who's been such an ideal leader for our organization. Laura, who's been such a strong supporter of this President. And, Todd, who will embark on his journey in public service with a significant role in the new administration next week. And, Pete, who's busy governing Nebraska, couldn't be here, but sends his best. [Laughter]\nFinally, we'd like to recognize all of our wives and significant others who do so much to support us behind the scenes, our great front office, who have worked so hard—[inaudible].\nSo, Mr. President, as you alluded to in Cleveland on November 2, and into the early morning of November 3, this special group of players behind me, in one of the greatest World Series games in history, ended the longest championship drought in American sports. And when Kris Bryant's throw settled into Anthony Rizzo's glove for the final out of Game 7, the victory brought pride, joy, relief, and redemption to Cub fans everywhere, including many in the White House. [Applause] Thank you.\nSo, many of you were there, but the city of Chicago erupted, unified into celebration that continues to this day. It was a thrilling, emotional time, and we think we even saw some White Sox fans smiling—[laughter]—which, Mr. President, brings us to you.\nThe President. Yes.\nMr. Epstein. We know you may have a certain allegiances to another team on the other side of town, but we know you're a very proud Chicagoan, and we know your better, wiser half, the First Lady—[laughter]—has been a lifelong and very loyal Cub fan, which we appreciate very much. And of course, we have great faith in your intelligence, your common sense, your pragmatism, your ability to recognize a good thing when you see one. [Laughter]\nSo, Mr. President, with only a few days remaining in your tremendous Presidency, we have taken the liberty here today of offering you a midnight pardon—[laughter]—for all your indiscretions as a baseball fan. And so we welcome you with open arms today into the Cubs family.\nTo recognize this terrific conversion and this great day, we have some gifts for you and your family. First, Anthony. Anthony Rizzo has graciously agreed to share his number 44 with \"the 44.\"\nThe President. There we go! Mr. Epstein. And if you're still not comfortable putting a Cubs jersey on, this one just says Chicago, so you're good with that one.\nThe President. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nMr. Epstein. Second, we have—at historic Wrigley Field, we have a centerfield scoreboard that's actually a historic landmark, and so we hope the National Park Service won't mind, but we took down a tile for you, number 44, which—[applause].\nThe President. That I like.\nMr. Epstein. Very few people have one of those.\nThe President. I know. That's very cool.\nMr. Epstein. We also wanted you to know that, as a new fan, you have a lot—you have some catching up to do. [Laughter] And you've been busy the last 8 years, and your family as well, so Laura Ricketts is here to present you with a lifetime pass to Wrigley Field for you and your family.\nThe President. Nice! I love how it says, \"Nontransferrable.\" [Laughter]\nMr. Epstein. Yes. It's strictly—it's just an emolument.\nThe President. Can you imagine if somebody walks up and is, like—[laughter].\nCo-owner and member of the Board of Directors Laura Ricketts. You don't have to bring it with you.\nMr. Epstein. And finally, every time we win a game in Chicago, we fly the \"W\" flag, as you know. So we brought one for you, signed by the entire team, and we'd love for you to fly it at your new library, which we plan to do our very best to support.\nThe President. We will do so. Thank you so much. Look at that. This is some nice swag. I'm telling you. Thank you so much. This is great.\nFormer pitcher Ferguson Jenkins. You've got to get him to put the uniform on. [Laughter]\nMr. Epstein. It's just day one. It's just day one.\nThe President. Fergie, we're doing okay so far. [Laughter] Let's not get carried away.\nMr. Epstein. So, Mr. President, thank you for the dignity and integrity with which you've served this country for the last 8 years, for your tremendous service to Chicago and Illinois before that and for hosting us here today. We wish you all the best and look forward to seeing you on Wrigley Field.\nThe President. Thank you. Well, everybody, the—thank you so much. Let me say, first of all, best swag I've gotten as President represented right here. [Laughter] And let me also say on behalf of a lot of folks here in the White House, you've brought a lot of joy to a lot of people here, and we're grateful. I know my former Chief of Staff, now mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel; folks like Dick Durbin, and we got a whole congressional delegation here; I see Lisa Madigan, my dear friend—just a lot of people have been rooting for you for a long time.\nSo even though it will be hard for me, Fergie, to wear a jersey—[laughter]—do know that among Sox fans, I'm the Cubs number-one fan.

This historic understanding reached between the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Russia, the European Union, and Iran has rolled back the Iranian nuclear program and verifiably prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nOne year ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified that Iran had fulfilled key commitments spelled out under the JCPOA. Instead of steadily expanding, Iran's nuclear program faces strict limitations and is subject to the most intrusive inspection and verification program ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. Iran reduced its uranium stockpile by 98 percent and removed two-thirds of its centrifuges. Meanwhile, Iran has not enriched any uranium at the Fordow facility nor used advanced centrifuges to enrich. In short, Iran is upholding its commitments, demonstrating the success of diplomacy.\nWhile this deal was intended to address Iran's nuclear program, we have remained steadfast in opposing Iran's threats against Israel and our Gulf partners and its support for violent proxies in places like Syria and Yemen. We continue to be deeply concerned about U.S. citizens unjustly imprisoned in Iran. And our sanctions on Iran for its human rights abuses, its support for terrorist groups, and its ballistic missile program will remain until Iran pursues a new path on those issues. There is no question, however, that the challenges we face with Iran would be much worse if Iran were also on the threshold of building a nuclear weapon.\nThe United States must remember that this agreement was the result of years of work and represents an agreement between the world's major powers, not simply the United States and Iran. Moreover, the Iran deal must be measured against the alternatives. A diplomatic resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is far preferable to an unconstrained Iranian nuclear program or another war in the Middle East.", "timestamp": "2017-01-16", "title": "Statement on the First Anniversary of the Implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action To Prevent Iran From Obtaining a Nuclear Weapon"}

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=49058", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Madam Ambassador, thanks for putting together a crowd for us. (Laughter.)\nFolks, I'm delighted to be here and happy to be back with so many distinguished people. And I mean that sincerely. Many of you know as much or more about the subjects I'm going to speak to than I do, including -- is Elizabeth Blackburn here? Elizabeth, a Nobel Laureate, who found the BRCA gene. As that old saying goes, she's forgotten more about this than I'm going to know.\nBut, folks, I'm happy to be back here at the World Economic Forum at Davos to talk about the fight against cancer. And I'm accompanied by Greg Simon, who is Executive Director of administration's Cancer Moonshot and who will lead my Biden Cancer Initiative that I'll launch after we leave office, which is in about 48 hours. (Laughter.) I hope I have a ride home. (Laughter.) I'll talk about in a few moments.\nBut, Greg, where are you? Greg has had a great deal of experience in this area and he's led the initiative the last year for the President and me.\nLast year, I arrived at the forum a few days after President Obama delivered his final State of the Union Address, where he announced, quite frankly to my surprise, that he was putting me in charge of a national Cancer Moonshot to double the rate of progress in preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer.\nAnd I was not only genuinely surprised by the announcement, I was genuinely surprised by the response that I got both at home and abroad. Here at Davos I was scheduled -- Klaus had asked me to deliver the keynote address on the promise and perils of the\nFourth Industrial Revolution, and to participate in a few bilateral meetings over the remaining days.\nBut given the overwhelming interest in the Cancer Moonshot, the forum asked me if I could quickly convene a roundtable of cancer experts, among whom Elizabeth was one of them, to discuss where we are and where we need to go in the fight against cancer.\nAnd so I did on a few days notice -- we put together such a roundtable -- and it kicked off what for me was a year-long journey that's taken me literally around the world meeting with the best cancer researchers, doctors, nurses, and patients, as well as philanthropists, heads of state -- they've all been part of it.\nBut I'm back here today to outline how far we've come and what -- at least from our perspective -- what path we should chart moving forward.\nAnd let me start with where we believe we are. When we announced the Cancer Moonshot, I knew there would be a lot of skeptics out there who'd say, \"well, here we go again. Haven't we done this before?\"\nPresident Nixon, when he declared War on Cancer in 1971, he was earnest and sincere and very committed. But what makes the difference between then and now is -- the single big difference is that he had no army. He had no resources. He had no weapons. He had no strategy to win.\nBut after 45 years with many of you in this room doing incredible work, 45 years of progress, after decades of funding research, training scientists and physicians, treating millions of patients, we now have an army. We now have powerful new technologies and tools, like: Immunotherapy that -- by the way, even six, eight, 10 years ago was viewed kind of as a voodoo science out there. It wasn't really an integral part of this fight -- that makes cancer cells visible to the immune system so our natural defenses can destroy the cancer.\nSurgeons are using cutting-edge robotics to allow for more precise imaging to find the cancer and more precisely surgically remove the cancer in hard-to-reach areas.\nLiquid biopsies that find early signs of cancer in the blood and tell you whether or not you have a particular cancer.\nThese advances and many others provide hope that more precise medicines and diagnostics might greatly improve and detect and defeat cancer.\nBut on so many levels, we've now reached an inflection point. When the system was set up before, we thought there was basically only one cancer in different parts of the body. We've now learned there are over 200 specific kinds of cancers.\nAfter decades we thought we could tackle cancer one discipline at a time. But that's not how cancer operates. Cancer uses every tool at its disposal -- it hides from the immune system, it builds it own blood supply system, it uses viruses to spread, it engineers a friendlier environment, a cellular environment in which to survive.\nAnd it knows how to spread through the body using pathways and mutations we don't understand fully yet. And cancer never gives up, it never surrenders. That's why we have to use every discipline cancer does, and that's what we're starting to in a way that's only really begun in the last five or six, seven years.\nFive years ago as I said, oncologists weren't routinely working closely with immunologists, virologists, geneticists, chemical and biological engineers. And now they are.\nImmunotherapies are finding the keys to making cancer cells visible and targeting them. Virologist are now working on vaccines to prevent and treat cancers. Geneticists are cataloging mutations that drive cancers. And chemical and biological engineers are helping engineer environments hostile to cancer. And they're all working together.\nLike many of you, I decided to become acquainted with this after someone close to me in my family was diagnosed. You tend to try to learn everything you possibly can once that occurs. And I knew little about the discipline. And like I said, what impressed me was that so much of this is really very brand new in terms of the collaboration.\nAlso, there's a recognition that by aggregating and sharing millions of patients' data, like genomics, family history, lifestyles, treatment outcomes and by using supercomputing power that we can do now a million billion calculations a second, we can understand why one therapy or treatment works for one person and not for another for the same exact cancer.\nAnd today, it was just announced that two major data sharing organizations, who were part of the roundtable. Five of them were here when we had the roundtable last year, two of them -- Cancer LinQ and another that focuses on genomic information called Project Genie -- are joining forces to accelerate data sharing of real-world clinical data that will improve cancers.\nAfter the meeting we had here, I asked the five groups that we're focusing on data sharing -- on aggregating data, I asked them whether they'd meet with me in Washington privately. And they came to my office, and we sat for an hour and a half. And I asked each of them to explain to me -- help educate me as to what they were doing. And I remember when we finished saying something that will not surprise you all, but you said, didn't you know that, Joe? I looked and said, but it sounds like you're all doing the same thing. No, I'm not being facetious. I said, you've all just made the case to me the more data you can aggregate across a spectrum, the more likely you are to find patterns, the most likely you are to find cures and/or treatments. Why aren't you talking to one another?\nAnd I remember afterwards several of them walking up to me as we were having coffee and pulling me aside and say, keep this up. Keep this up. But I didn't -- I had nothing to do with this sharing and collaboration. But the point is the mood is changing as I feel it just in the last year.\nI also learned from the best minds in the world that the strategy we've been following is equivalent to fighting the last war. The model of scientific breakthroughs for most of the history was one of individual achievement, Jonas Salk in the laboratory finding the -- creating the polio vaccine. There was little -- if any -- sharing among hospitals and researchers, and little ability to share even if they wanted to share.\nAnd across the world, our funding processes and systems of academic research primarily follow that old model. So the Moonshot has fundamentally been about two things since I began it. And the first objective I've had was to inject the urgency of now into this fight and double the rate of progress and do in five years instead of 10.\nAnd when I say urgency of now, the brightest minds I've met in the world -- and I've been doing my job and mostly working on strategic doctrine and foreign policy my career -- the brightest people I've met, I've met now and spoken with over 13,000 cancer researchers in the two major organizations. I've met with scores and scores of leaders in the field. I've met with seven or eight Nobel Laureates in the field. And the amazing thing to me is that they're all working so hard. But with a few changes, even without learning more information, we could probably extend the life of a lot of people.\nThe one thing that the clinicians can tell you is -- and those of you who are clinicians -- how many times have you had a patient say to you, Doctor, can you just -- I know you can't save me, but can you just give me two more weeks so I can watch her get married, doc? Doc, can you just keep me around for another month so I can see my first grandchild born, doc? Doc, I'm not asking for anything except can you just extend a little bit? I might be able to get my finances in order.\nYou hear that all the time. I heard that at my son's beside. He wasn't afraid of dying, but he wanted to settle a few things. Greater collaboration with no new breakthroughs can have the possibility of being able to say to one in four or five of those patients, yes, I can figure a way, just a little longer.\nThe second thing, objective I had was changing the culture, coming up with a new strategy for this fight. Not for the strategy for the last fight.\nWe have four primary structures for organizing the Moonshot. One, we established the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force to reimagine the federal government's fight and role in this fight to break down silos in the federal government. I went all over the world literally asking for suggestions: What should we be doing better?\nUnder this task force, which I engaged and Greg met with members of each of the departments at least once every two weeks for updates on progress that was being made on things we were trying to do, we engaged everyone from the National Institutes of Health, to the Defense Department and to Veterans Affairs -- but to some agencies never been involved. NASA -- everybody would go why in the hell are they bringing NASA into this, or the Patent Office, or the Environmental Protection Agency, or the White House policy councils, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, they all have a role to play.\nSecondly, we hosted a Cancer Moonshot Summit in June. Some of you participated in that summit. We held it in D.C., over 400 of you came. We had roundtables on various aspects of dealing with cancer. Some of you were there, made significant contributions. But interestingly enough, we simulcast, in effect, these roundtables where 7,000 people around the country gathered in 300 local summits held in every single state, including Guam and Puerto Rico to try to again inject this notion of the urgency of now.\nAnd the summit workshops launched a torrent of new collaborations and innovative initiatives across all sectors, and they continue to this day.\nFor example, we got a call from IBM. How would you like to borrow Watson? They came to us and offered Watson, their supercomputer, to partner with the largest hospital in the world, the Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs. So now a veteran can get her genome or tumor sequenced at Walter Reed, and they're very good at it and they can do it quickly, and then Watson will search all specific therapies that would target that particular cancer and provide recommendations to the physicians and tumor boards to use in choosing the right therapy. So you increase the prospect that the first time out will be the best shot out.\nIn June, I was at the University of Chicago, where we launched the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons. The purpose was to bring together cancer sequencing data and related patient information from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Well, that atlas comprised roughly 14,000 individuals with that data. Now the database has grown now to over 30,000 individuals. And our international agreements are going to add tens of thousands of more patients' data.\nAnd Amazon came along and says, look, we'll agree to make their cloud computing available to help us store these enormous amounts of data that this project is going to generate.\nBut the important thing is, that it's a totally open-access database, able to be accessed by any researcher in the world, eliminating the silos. It did not exist a year ago. And this data has already been accessed and used more than 5 million times, and this was in the spring of last year -- increasing chances exponentially that we may find some answers.\nWe've also transformed access to cancer clinical trials. In the United States only 4 percent of the people diagnosed with cancer ever become part of a clinical trial, which is how research advances and may be the only possibility of saving the patient's life. Maybe.\nSo we engaged the President's Innovation Fellows, some of the top, young technology minds in the world, mostly from Silicon Valley, who have dedicated a year to come in. These are trying to modernize the whole government. So I went to them and said, look, there's no way anyone can rationally go and figure out that that oncologist from Bemidji, Minnesota, who has come up with an accurate diagnosis doesn't know where to turn. He's not near one of the great cancer centers in the United States. So where do they go?\nThere was a site that said you could click on and find out where there were cancer trials. But it was useless. So these brilliant, young -- they range in age from 25 to 40 thereabouts -- within three weeks put together a site. They can go now. It's trials.cancer.gov. Type in real words like breast cancer, leukemia, and ZIP codes, age, and then find a list of clinical trials near you or your loved one that previously you could not have easily found. And find the people equally excited about this are the pharmaceutical companies. They have trouble finding enough people for their trials.\nYou and your doctor can now find out what trials are available for your types of cancer near you.\nAnother example is NASA I mentioned earlier, working with the National Cancer Institute, establishing a new collaboration to study the biological effects of particle beam radiotherapy, a novel technology that may deliver a more targeted dose of radiation to tumor cells.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advancing the effort to promote cancer vaccines like the HPV vaccine that are safe and effective strategies for combatting viruses -- for various types of cancer.\nThe Moonshot also initiated the Blood Profiling Atlas Pilot. Representatives from the government, academia, and pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies are launching partnerships to create an open database for liquid biopsies to accelerate the development of safe and effective blood profiling diagnostic technologies and our patient will benefit from this.\nStanford Medicine and the VA in Palo Alto are collaborating to establish the Hadron Center in Palo Alto, California, for the potential benefit of both Veteran and non-Veteran cancer patients.\nThe Hadron Center will utilize particle-beam radiotherapy using beams of charged particles such as proton and helium, carbon, or other ions to allow more precise targeting everywhere inside the patient's body, potentially -- we don't know yet -- resulting in less damage to healthy cells.\nThe reason NASA got in the game is they know more about radiation than anybody in the world, so they're participating.\nEarlier this year we announced what we call the NCI -- the National Cancer Institute Formulary. This is a public-private partnership with more than two dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which allows researchers to test existing drugs for new combinations that could be effective against different types of cancer.\nThis is how it works. When you go into a bar and you listen to a song and you put money in a jukebox, you don't have to negotiate a licensing agreement with each song from the record company you're about to play. That licensing agreement has already been worked out.\nBut until recently, if you waited to use -- you've wanted to use a combination of drug, you had to go through each company, get permission to use each different drug. It literally could take years. And a lot of people got lost in the meantime that might have been saved.\nNow, the NCI has already worked out the details of intellectual property, access, and licensing so researchers and companies know there is an agreement on licensing if the drug is successful and how the intellectual property will be shared.\nThis new system just launched. And I urge as many of you as possible to join it, participate, and share. It will make an enormous difference potentially.\nCombination drugs have the potential to do for cancers what many of you have done for HIV. There was total collaboration in HIV.\nThere are dozens of other actions that you can read about in WhiteHouse.gov/CancerMoonshot.\nThe third thing we did was we created a Cancer Moonshot blue ribbon panel at our national institute to recommend research that holds the most promise for additional investments. Some of you were named to that panel. My dad used to have an expression. He said, Joey, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is important to you. What do the best minds in the world think are the best therapies or technologies we should be pursuing as rapidly as we can, in what order?\nThat blue ribbon panel delivered a report with transformative recommendations to change the research blueprint for the National Cancer Institute.\nFor example: Launching a 3-D Cancer Atlas. Oncologists today rely on past experience, consultation with multidisciplinary teams, published studies, and other sources to make diagnosis and treatment decisions.\nBut providing a web-based catalog of the genetic lesions and cellular interactions in a tumor, immune and other cells in the tumor, the microenvironment -- one that maps the evolution of tumor -- from development to metastasis, it's going to enable researchers to develop predictive models for tumor progression and response to treatment that will ultimately help oncologists make informed treatment decisions for each patient\nNow none of this is a guaranteed promise. But it all holds significant potential. Establishing a national network of cancer patients that, with appropriate privacy safeguards, will provide them with a genetic profile of their own cancer and let them \"pre-register\" for clinical trials, so they can be contacted when a trial in which they may be eligible opens; establishing clinical trials networks devoted exclusively to immunotherapies for pediatric and adult cancers would advance research in this area and could lead to new vaccines to prevent cancers of all types in children, as well as adults; expanding the use of proven cancer prevention and early detection strategies.\nSeveral cancer prevention and risk reduction strategies have proven to be highly effective, including tobacco control, colorectal cancer screening, HPV vaccine.\nBoosting prevention research to identify ways to increase the uptake of these strategies, especially in medically underserved populations could greatly reduce the incidence and death from lung and other tobacco-related cancers, colorectal cancer, cervical and other HPV-related cancers, respectively.\nHere's why it matters. By some estimates, at least 50 percent of the cancers can be prevented, and that prevention falls into three major categories:\nOne: Personal actions on the part of the individual, such as living a healthier lifestyle, avoiding cancer risk behaviors, like smoking.\nThe second way of prevention is the responsibilities of government and industry to reduce carcinogens and toxins in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we grow our food in.\nAnd the third is to make available existing diagnostic tools to all communities -- because we know the earlier cancer is detected, the better prospect for an outcome that's good.\nBut there is a fourth outcome, an entirely new set of diagnostic tools that can detect cancers earlier, new technologies like hereditary markers. Instead of waiting until you're 48 years old to get your first colonoscopy, if they have the marker, get it when you're 16 years old.\nAnd by continuing to keep an eye on it, prevent you from being the victim of dying of cancer -- of that cancer.\nThe fourth -- and in addition to the task force report, I was asked to deliver a report to the President in October that included the progress made '16 and my assessment -- and it's only mine of what the road ahead looks like. Obviously, I would like you all to look at that and critique it.\nThe report lays out the changes we need in our view to implement -- to implement at our research institutions and universities to align our research system with the realities and opportunities of the 21st century.\nAnd all this has helped us make progress on the international fight against cancer.\nLast April I delivered remarks at conference on Regenerative Medicine hosted by the Vatican and that the Pope addressed as well. I laid out what I thought to be the guideposts for international collaboration through the Moonshot.\nOne: Focus on prevention, access, and affordability around the world.\nTwo: Raise the urgency of international response to cancer, reflecting the same urgency we bring to infectious disease threats. There are 16 Million people who will die from cancer this year. And according to many of the experts in the audience, if we don't do anything about it, there will be 26 million dying by 2020.\nIncrease research and patient data sharing among researchers, institutions, foundations, nations. Support standardization of data and biorepositories. Increase government investment and cancer research -- we should increase it to capitalize on this moment, of this inflection point.\nSince then, the United States has signed 10 memoranda of understanding in nine countries. I'm supposedly an expert on foreign policy. An expert is anyone from out of town with a briefcase. (Laughter.) I have traveled over 1.3 million miles for the President, meeting with heads of state, most of whom I've known most of my career. I was recently in the Gulf, the Persian Gulf recently, seven months ago, talking about the fight against ISIS with a head of state, sitting on the Gulf, the Persian Gulf, talking about -- he had his people lined up on one side of a table outside and I had mine for a dinner. And before we began, he said, Mr. Vice President, before we talk about ISIS -- they call it Daesh -- before we talk about Daesh, can we talk about cancer? We want to help.\nIn that tour through the Middle East in Jordan and Israel, can we talk about cancer?\nThe President put together and 50 heads of state came in the East Room with rectangular tables lined up around the entire room with 50 heads of state on how to deal with the nuclear proliferation. The President sat in front of the fireplace. And I was directly across from him, my back to that famous hallway. Before he began he said, I know a lot of you want to talk to Joe about cancer, but let's deal with the nuclear issue first. (Laughter.) He wasn't being facetious. The result -- whether I was in Melbourne, Japan, the UAE, we've signed -- we were sought after and signed 10 detailed memorandum of understanding as to how we should jointly proceed.\nThese have focused on data sharing and advanced research.\nLast month, we saw the United States Congress come together. I know I'm supposedly the guy that Republicans and Democrats like in the Congress. I actually respect the Congress. That's part of the problem that people think I have. But I genuinely do. And we could get anything through the Congress.\nBut through the leadership of some Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate, they put together what they call the 21st Century Cures Act, and no one thought we could pass it. At the very waning hours, we were able to go up and get them jointly to appropriate and commit to 6.3 billion in biomedical and health-related research, including $1.8 billion for the National Cancer Institute to invest in additional research as part of the Moonshot. This is the one bipartisan thing that exists, and I pray will continue to exist in the new administration.\nBut it also is an international consensus. So we have enormous opportunities I believe with greater collaboration, but organizing a different pathway than we've been following.\nThis investment, in my view, should be matched by other nations who agree that now is the time to double-down in our fight against cancer. And it's my hope, as I've already spoken to the Vice President-elect, who is a good man, about to come in to be Vice President in four days or three days, about my willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration to be committed and enthusiastic as we are to the goal of ending cancer as we know it. And my prayer is they will do that, as well.\nBut I know those in the private sector, philanthropy, at academic institutions and non-profit organizations, will continue the work regardless of what the next administration does. There's too much momentum here. And this will include me as a private citizen.\nI do not have -- I hope I'm well informed, but I don't have the expertise most of you have, but I've found I have the power to convene and thus far I've been viewed as a fair dealer. I have no interest in any one institution or another. And I maybe even have the ability to occasionally shame so people move in directions that up to now there's been unwillingness to move because of the culture that's developed.\nAfter I leave office, after meeting with some very significant people who many of you know -- a coupe in this room as well -- who have encouraged me to set up the Biden Cancer Initiative with similar goals of the Moonshot, changing the way we do business in cancer research and development and providing cancer care.\nThe initiative will focus on, one, improving data standards and giving patients a mechanism to share their data, so they can help many other patients going through the same fight; and so researchers can use the data to find new patients and new cures. Most people are not experts like you. They think that already exists, that patients actually own their own data; that people -- they actually have access to their own data. I was with one particular researcher, and he said, well, we're having trouble getting patients. And I said, I tell you what, I'll make you a bet -- the press was with me, like here -- I said, I bet if I ask them, their networks will give me 15 minutes of primetime to talk about this. I said, if I pick one single repository, I'll bet you I get minimum between 2 million and 10 million patients who the next morning will give you their data, say they'll send it there. And this researcher said, well, yes, maybe you have a point.\nGuys, this is not -- this is within our wheelhouse. That's the easy part. The hard part is what you all do.\nWorking with community care organizations to help improve access to care and quality of care is another focus that we'll have. So outcomes aren't wholly dictated by your ZIP code.\nAnd convening a national conversation with pharmaceutical companies, insurers, biotech companies, and others to ensure patients can afford treatments. Too many Americans are forced to sell their homes, go into bankruptcy, just so a loved one can get the care and hope for the cure. That needs to change.\nAnd these companies need to have serious remuneration. They're taking real risks. But there's got to be a way we can figure this out.\nAnd also calling for greater transparency and access to clinical trials, so more patients can get access to treatments that might work for their cancer.\nAnd continuing to work for cultural change and improvements in our cancer research system, so we can make the best use of today's opportunities to generate, share and knowledge from patients and researchers to help patients everywhere around the world.\nThese are the reasons why I plan on staying involved -- because for the first time in 45 years, there is some real movement toward collaboration. Not because people are selfish, but because it wasn't the model. It's not the way it worked for good reason. But the collaboration between cancer centers, drug companies, the insurance industry, and government is where the solution lies -- and how we'll end cancer as we know it.\nSo let me conclude by saying, which will not shock you: I am optimistic. (Laughter.) I know I'm always optimistic. But I am optimistic because of the absolute commitment and sheer brilliance I have been exposed to from so many researchers and scientists and these great institutions.\nI see the day when patients get the right therapy the first time for their cancer, where prevention is more effective, and\nwhere care is personalized and more effective with less harmful side effects.\nI see the day when those younger people of you in this room, when you take your children and grandchildren later for their school physical, that they will -- at the time they get their vaccination against measles and mumps, they'll be vaccinated against certain types of cancer -- like you can be vaccinated against HPV virus.\nI see the day when we'll be able to identify through markers in the blood, cancers that haven't even developed yet.\nAnd the one thing I can tell you: There is hope.\nI'm willing to bet everyone in this room who has had cancer, or has a loved one who has had cancer, you understand that feeling when the doctor says, it's cancer.\nYou all know, at that moment, the one thing you most need is some reason to hope.\nWhen President Kennedy discussed sending humankind to the moon, he talked about the commitment the nation -- and this is the phrase he used -- the commitment the nation was \"unwilling to postpone.\"\nA very famous speech, and some of you can probably recite the speech, but the part of the speech since I've been a kid that got me the most about my notion about governance, my notion about exploration, my notion about science was when a nation or a people \"unwilling to postpone.\" We should be unwilling to postpone finding the answer to how to end cancer as we know it.\nAnd I'm confident we can do it. You're already doing it. But let's double down. It is about the urgency of now.\nI thank you all for your graciousness in listening and thank you for having me.

(Laughter.) This has been going on a long time.\nGood afternoon, everyone. It's a great, pleasure to be once more here in Kyiv to reaffirm the depth of the partnership between our two peoples. This is my sixth visit to Ukraine as Vice President and my fifth in the year since the Revolution of Dignity on the Maidan, which was an astounding thing to witness when so many Ukrainian patriots stood up and demanded a future that this country has been too long denied.\nAnd I wanted to come here one more time on my last trip as Vice President to honor how much progress the people of Ukraine have achieved. This year marks the 25th year since Ukraine gained its independence. And the United States has been there to support and help you at every step of the way. Our partnership has spanned four different American Presidents from across our political spectrum. It has deep roots in both the Republican and Democratic parties.\nAs you saw a few weeks ago when two of my good friends from \"the other side\" -- former Senate colleagues John McCain and Lindsey Graham and Amy Klobuchar, of my party -- visited with Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the east.\nAnd that's because Americans and Ukrainians are united by deep bonds -- our shared values and our common hopes for the future. And the American people, including nearly 1 million proud Ukrainian Americans, understand that so much depends on your success, not just for Ukrainians, but for Europe and for the United States.\nIf you continue carrying your progress forward, then not only will you continue to build a more open, more democratic, more prosperous future that the Ukrainian people deserve, you will keep the international community united behind you in that effort.\nAnd I hope the next administration will also want to be a supporter and a partner in your continued progress. But as you know, no one else can do the hard work but the Ukrainian people. It's up to Ukrainian leaders and people to put the needs of the country above narrow personal interest, to place the general good above point scoring and local prejudices. And that goes for everyone -- members of Ukraine's government; representatives of the Rada, who took an oath to serve the Ukrainian people as a whole; judges who undertake the responsibility to dispense justice equally; members of the media and civil society and ordinary citizens whose job it is to hold those in power responsible.\nAs I said last year when I had the great honor to address the Rada, \"Each of you has an obligation to answer the call of history and finally build a united, democratic Ukrainian nation that can stand the test of time.\"\nYou're well underway to do that, Mr. President. So I wanted to thank you, Petro, not only for your leadership but for your friendship. I shared the same sentiment earlier this morning when I met Prime Minister Groysman earlier today. As a nation you've made a lot of very difficult decisions. And many more difficult political choices remain ahead. But there is no denying the progress that Ukraine has made since the Maidan. Together with a dynamic generation of Ukrainians committed to reform, you've begun to overhaul your government, your economy, your entire political system.\nIn the year since my last visit, you continue to meet the reform requirements in the IMF assistance package. You've strengthened the country's banking sector. You protected Ukrainian depositors by nationalizing Privatbank. You implemented a groundbreaking, new electronic-asset-declaration system to fight corruption, which will help ensure that officials cannot leverage their political positions for personal gain.\nYour national anti-corruption bureau and the special anti-corruption prosecutor are providing and proving their impact when they have the resources. And it's imperative that you continue to strengthen all of your anti-corruption institutions to root out those who would return Ukraine to rule by cronyism and kleptocracy.\nThanks to the vital steps you've taken, your economy is now growing again. But there remains much work to be done to ensure Ukraine finally realizes its potential as a vibrant, modern economy. Keep working with the IMF to implement the tough reforms that will make Ukraine's economy sustainable. Continue cleaning up the banking system. Press forward with energy reforms that are eliminating Ukraine's dependence on Russian gas. Work to privatize state-owned enterprises transparently. Create a business environment with responsible, legal, and regulatory systems that make Ukraine a destination for investment. None of this will be easy. None of what you've done so far has been easy, but you've done it. And we know it's going to be hard to continue to finish the job.\nYou're fighting both against the cancer of corruption, which continues to eat away at Ukraine's democracy within, and the unrelenting aggression of the Kremlin.\nRussia's continued attempts to undermine your success, your security, your sovereignty, and your territorial integrity are manifold. False propaganda attacks. Attempts to destabilize your economy. Ukraine, like every country in Europe, has a right to determine its own path. Yet Russia seeks to deny that choice. And the international community must continue to stand as one against Russian aggression and coercion.\nThere are over 1.7 million internally displaced people Oppression of Crimean Tatars continues. More than 9,600 Ukrainians have been killed in the fighting in the east and more than 22,000 wounded in the conflict. And fully one-fifth of those victims have been civilians.\nThat's why in addition to the $3 billion in loan guarantees and the $750 million in assistance to fortify your economic resilience, the United States has provided $600 million in security assistance. We've trained your national guard, conventional military forces, as well as special forces; helped you increase your readiness and make your force interoperable with NATO; provided armor, radars, night-vision devices, medical equipment -- all of which has saved lives and bolstered your defenses.\nTogether with our EU and G7 partners, we've made it clear that sanctions should remain in place until Russia fully -- I emphasize fully -- implements its commitments under the Minsk Agreement; and that the Crimea-related sanctions against Russia must remain in place until Russia returns full control to the people of Ukraine.\nAlthough I know how -- you find this difficult to keep faith with the Minsk process when the Russians refuse to meet their security commitments, it remains the only viable framework for resolving the conflict in the Donbas, restoring Ukrainian governance in the east, and returning control of the international border to Ukraine. It's Ukraine's best hope to move forward as a united country.\nBut let me be perfectly clear, the political agreement cannot be implemented until Russian violence stops. Only after Russia and its proxies in the east fulfill their obligation to end the fighting and let the Donbas again enjoy peace and security can Ukraine be expected to fulfill its political commitments.\nIt's no secret that Russia does not want you to succeed, Mr. President. It's not just about Ukraine. It's about the future we have long sought of a Europe whole, free, and at peace -- whole, free, and at peace -- something that is in the vital national interest of both the United States and all Europeans.\nYour self-determination, your freedom from coercion, your success as a liberal democracy are all essential in realizing this objective.\nSo I strongly urge the people of Ukraine: Keep demonstrating your commitment to the rule of law; keep fighting corruption; insist on transparency; investigate and prosecute government officials who siphon off public funds for their own enrichment. Russia over the last decade or so has used another foreign policy weapon. It uses corruption as a tool of coercion to keep Ukraine vulnerable and dependent. So pursue those reforms to root out corruption.\nIt's not just about good governance. It's about self-preservation. It's about your very national security. It's not just about good governance. As I said at the beginning, this year our nations celebrate 25 years of diplomatic relations. Over that time progress has come in fits and starts. Sometimes we move forward, sometimes backwards.\nBut the Ukrainian people are like the American people, they never give up. And one of the things that gives me the most hope for the future is the incredible energy and passion of Ukraine's young people. I've met with them on each of my previous visits here. And I have no doubt that they will inspire, demand, and ultimately succeed in attaining the Ukraine that has been sought for for so long.\nOn a personal note, Mr. President, I want say what a privilege it has been to support and stand with Ukraine over these past 25 years -- first as a senator and of late as Vice President.\nI've been inspired by your people, their courage, their resilience, brave Ukrainians who never gave up hope for a future of something better, who get up and go to work every day for a democratic and united Ukraine.\nAnd if you can continue to make progress, Mr. President, if you keep doing the hard work and making the difficult choices to put Ukraine first, I promise you the American people will stand with you. This next year is going to be a very, very telling year -- a very telling year.\nThere is a line that John Kennedy used in deciding to go to the moon. He said, America is doing it because we can no longer -- we're no longer willing to postpone. I believe the Ukrainian people are no longer willing to postpone a free, open, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine. So seize it.\nI'm looking forward to seeing what our nations can build together, Mr. President, over the next 25 years and beyond because as my grandfather would say, with the grace of the God, and the good will of the neighbors, which we can't count on very much in this neighborhood, we can get this done. But it all depends on the willingness of your people to continue to insist on what they deserve because they deserve it.", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kyiv, Ukraine"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=49433", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:15 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I don't actually have any announcements at the top, but --\nQ: Thank you. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: But because today marks my last briefing, I hope you'll indulge me a couple of personal thoughts before I go to your questions.\nAs I prepared to stand here at this podium for the last time, I thought a lot about the first time. It was 16 years ago this week. It was January, 2001. I had just moved to Washington, D.C., and I got on a West Wing tour with a friend of a friend. We walked through the halls of the West Wing on that tour. We saw tired White House staffers lugging boxes of their personal belongings out of the building, much the way that people who are on West Wing tours today see. And on the tour, I smiled for a photo that a friend took of me standing behind this very podium.\nI had been in D.C. for a grand total of two weeks. I had no contacts. I had no job prospects. I had no relevant Washington experience. I was sleeping on the floor of a college buddy's apartment that had a spare bedroom -- and by spare, I don't just mean it was an extra bedroom; it was an empty bedroom containing only the items that I had managed to load into my car when I moved here from Texas.\nSo it's fair to say that there weren't too many other people on the tour that night who thought I would stand here in front of you as something other than a tourist. So it's been an extraordinary journey, and this has been an extraordinary chapter.\nThis is the 354th White House daily briefing that I have led as the Press Secretary -- Mark can check me on that number. (Laughter.) Not every briefing started exactly on time. (Laughter.) There might have been a briefing or two that went a little longer than you would have preferred. But you had to admit there was a lot to discuss. We had plenty of shameless plugs for the Kansas City Royals to squeeze in. (Laughter.) There was, of course, the Freedom Caucus's infamous Tortilla Coast gambit. There was Congressman Steve Scalise who reportedly compared himself favorably to David Duke. There was the reintroduction of the word \"snafu\" into the political lexicon as we were working to pass TPA.\nWe discussed at length the various ways you can catch Zika, the various ways you can catch Ebola, and the various reasons scientists recommend you vaccinate your kids so that you don't catch the measles. Jon Stewart lit me up as I struggled to explain to Jon Karl why a couple of our political ambassadors for some reason had no idea what they were doing. (Laughter.) At least the Stewart segment made some of my friends laugh.\nPresident-elect Trump, of course, took advantage of the opportunity to light me up as a \"foolish guy\" who makes even the good news sound bad. (Laughter.) And I have to admit that even that one made me laugh. (Laughter.)\nBut it wasn't always fun and games around here. There was the time that I tangled with Senator Schumer about DHS funding for New York City, and the time that I tangled with Senator Schumer over the Iran deal -- (laughter) -- and the time that I tangled with Senator Schumer over the JASTA legislation, and the time I tangled with Senator Schumer over the wisdom of passing Obamacare, and the time I tangled with Senator Schumer over Trade Promotion Authority legislation. And to think, we actually spent most of the last two and a half years complaining about how unreasonable Republicans in Congress are. (Laughter.)\nThe daily briefing, of course, is the most high-profile part of the press secretary's job, but it's not the only part that matters. The more important part, in many ways, is working with all of you and ensuring the freedom of the press that keeps this democracy vital.\nWhen I first entered this role, I worked closely with the White House Travel Office and the Department of Defense to reform the billing process for your flights on military aircraft, including Air Force One, making those bills more transparent and smaller. In the last two and a half years, we've cajoled governments in China, Ethiopia, and Cuba to host news conferences on their soil, allowing the leaders of those countries and their citizens to see firsthand what it means for independent journalists to hold those in power accountable.\nOf course, it was the end-of-the-year news conference that the President convened in this room in 2014 that got as much attention as any other because President Obama called on eight journalists, all women.\nAnd finally, everything about this final week makes me think of all the incredible people whom I've been blessed to work with these past eight years. I only have this opportunity because Robert Gibbs pulled me aside on Election Night 2008 in Chicago as the returns were coming in to tell me that he wanted me to come work with him at the White House. I'm only here because Jay Carney, Jennifer Palmieri and Dan Pfeiffer supported and encouraged me when I was the deputy, and advocated for me when Jay stepped down.\nI've also benefitted from a kitchen cabinet of senior White House officials, who've got a lot of other important responsibilities that are part of their formal job description, but stepped in to help me out every time I asked for it. And that's people like Denis McDonough and Susan Rice and Jennifer Psaki, Liz Allen, Jesse Lee, Cody Keenan, and, of course, Ben Rhodes. And I've only been able to do this job because I have an incredible team around me.\nMy assistants over the years, Jeff Tiller, Antoinette Rangel, and now Desiree Barnes all patiently supported a guy who, let's face it, sometimes isn't so easy to assist. The White House stenographers -- Dominique Dansky Bari, Beck Dorey-Stein, Amy Sands, Mike McCormick, Caitlin Young, and their tireless leader, Peggy Suntum -- they work as hard as anybody at the White House and complain about it less than anybody at the White House. (Applause.)\nApplause is appropriate at that point. (Applause.) I think the only team that may contend with them might be the research department here at the White House that's led by Alex Platkin and Kristen Bartoloni. But I hope you'll get a chance over the course of the next week to thank the stenographers for their important work, because I know they make your lives a lot easier, too.\nThe same goes for Peter Velz, Brian Gabriel and Sarah Rutherford, who are stretched as thin, and who are at least as effective as any team of press wranglers we've ever had here at the White House. My colleagues at the NSC, including Ned Price, Emily Horne, Mark Stroh, Carl Woog, and Dew Tiantawach patiently explained to me things that I didn't know so that I could, in turn, explain them to you.\nMy team in lower press -- Patrick Rodenbush, Katie Hill and Brandi Hoffine -- is as talented and as dedicated as any press team in this town. I begged Brandi to join this team when I first got this job, and her performance has far exceeded the sky-high recommendations I got from people all over town after I interviewed her. They are all -- Katie, Brandi and Patrick -- as they say, going places.\nEric Schultz is simply the best deputy that anyone in any field could ask for. He shows up early, he stays late. He's deft -- that's an inside joke. (Laughter.) He's always prepared. He's unfailingly loyal. His judgment is sought after throughout the halls of the White House, not just by me, but by various members of the senior staff and I'm sure will be sought after in his bright post-White House future, too. Including by me.\nWhen you're President of the United States and widely regarded as among the most thoughtful and eloquent speakers on the planet, it must be hard to watch someone go on TV and speak for you. I suspect that's why, when the President offered me this job, he said he wouldn't watch my briefings. (Laughter.) But I know that he saw parts of them on those very rare occasions that he watched cable TV. And he never second-guessed me. Not once. He didn't just give me the opportunity of a lifetime, he had my back every single day. And I'm grateful for it.\nBut there is one person who contributed to my success more than anyone else, and she doesn't even work at the White House. My wife, Natalie, was six months pregnant with our first child when I got this job. She was home with the air-conditioning repairman when the President of the United States called me into the Oval Office to offer me the job. When I got back to my desk, I saw that I had several missed calls on my cellphone from her. I quickly called her back. I told her that I was sorry that I missed her calls, but that I had the best possible excuse for missing them.\nSince then she has extended to me more support and understanding than I could ever ask for, even as she was becoming the best mom any two-year-old kid could hope for. When I missed the mark up here, she didn't hesitate to tell me about it. And when I got it right the next day, it was usually because I followed her advice.\nSo, thank you, sweetheart, for your patience, your loyalty, your counsel, and your love. Without it, I would not be standing here. And I will never be able to make it up to you, but I look forward to spending some more time with you and Walker so I can give it a shot.\nServing as the White House Press Secretary under President Obama has been an incredible honor. I've had the opportunity to advocate for his vision of the country, the same vision that deeply resonated with me when I signed up to work for him in Iowa in March 2007.\nAnd while those of us who have been fortunate enough to serve him here will go on to make a difference in new ways, I take heart in knowing that all of you will still be here. I draw confidence in knowing that you are driven by the same spirit that prompted those young kids that I mentioned at the top of my briefing a couple of weeks ago to move to an Iowa town that they'd never heard of to organize support for the Obama campaign.\nYou have the same determination as the young people who are moving to Washington, D.C. today, with no job, with no contacts and no prospects, who are hoping to work in the Trump administration. You're motivated in the same way as the career civil servants, like the one as the Department of Education, who's trying to stretch her agency's budget to ensure as many Hispanic kids as possible can get a decent education. You have so much in common with these people because each of you and what you do every day is critical to the success of our democracy.\nThere will be days when you'll show up to work tired. I know the same was true of those Obama organizers in Iowa. There will be days where you will feel disrespected. And I know many of the young Republican staffers who move to Washington looking for a job will feel that way at times. It's hard to pound the pavement in this town when you don't know anybody. There will be days where you will wonder if what you're doing even makes a difference. And I know that our civil servants sometimes wonder the same thing.\nBut I assure you, if you -- the most talented, experienced, effective press corps in the world -- didn't play your part in our democracy, we would all notice. Your passion for your work and its centrality to the success of our democracy is a uniquely American feature of our government. It's made President Obama a better President and a better public servant. And it's because you persevere and you never go easy on us.\nSo even though it's my last day, you better not let up now. So in that spirit, let me say for the last time standing up here -- Josh, you want to get us started with questions.\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Oh! (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm not interrupting because he was saying nice things about you guys -- (laughter) -- because I largely concur.\nWhen I first met Josh Earnest, he was in Iowa. I think he was wearing jeans. He looked even younger than he was. And since my entire campaign depended on communications in Iowa, I gave him a pretty good once-over. And there are a couple things I learned about him right away. Number one, he's just got that all-American, matinee, good-looking thing going. (Laughter.) That's helpful. Let's face it -- a face made for television. Then the guy's name is Josh Earnest -- (laughter) -- which if somebody is speaking on your behalf is a pretty good name to have. (Laughter.)\nBut what struck me most, in addition to his smarts and his maturity and his actual interest in the issues, was his integrity. There are people you meet who you have a pretty good inkling right off the bat are straight-shooters and were raised to be fundamentally honest and to treat people with respect. And there are times when that first impression turns out to be wrong, and you're a little disappointed. And you see behind the curtain that there's spin and some hype and posturing going on. But then there's others who, the longer you know them, the better you know them, the more time you spend with them, the more you're tested under tough situations, the more that initial impression is confirmed.\nAnd I have now known this guy for 10 years, almost, and I've watched him grow and I've watched him advance, and I've watched him marry, and I've watched him be a father, and I've watched him manage younger people coming up behind him. And he's never disappointed. He has always been the guy you wanted him to be.\nAnd I think that if you're the President of the United States and you find out that this is the guy who has been voted the most popular Press Secretary ever by the White House Press Corps, that may make you a little nervous, thinking well, maybe the guy's going -- being too solicitous towards the press. But the fact is, is that he was worthy of that admiration.\nHe was tough, and he didn't always give you guys everything you wanted. But he was always prepared. He was always courteous. He always tried to make sure he could share with you as much of our thinking and our policy and our vision as possible, and tried to be as responsive as possible. And that's how he trained the rest of his team to be.\nSo, of the folks that I've had the great joy and pleasure of working with over the last 10 years on this incredible journey, this guy ranks as high as just about anybody I've worked with. He is not only a great Press Secretary, but more importantly, he is a really, really good man. And I'm really, really proud of him.\nSo, Josh, congratulations. (Applause.)\nAnd, Natalie and Walker, thanks for putting up with all of this -- because they've made sacrifices, too.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, sir.\nQ: Before you go, respond to Vladimir Putin?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm going to be here (laughter) --\nQ: Where are you going on Friday? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that was awfully generous. So the President will be back tomorrow. He'll be standing here and he'll be answering your questions. Today you're going to settle for me.\nSo, Josh, you want to get us started?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh, and I want to thank you and your team for your hard work and service in your roles. We've all tussled aggressively with you over the last many years, but that was as it should be, and you all have continued to always engage with us and we appreciate that.\nFollowing up on the question that was just asked, have the Obamas decided where they will be heading when they board the Presidential aircraft for the final time on Friday?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. Josh, I can tell you that the First Family is looking forward to flying to Palms Spring, California on Friday. The President vowed to take his family to a destination that is warmer than Washington, D.C. on Friday, and Palm Springs fits the bill. This is a community that the President has visited on a number of occasions as President of the United States. He and his family have enjoyed the time they have spent there in the past and they're looking forward to traveling there on Friday.\nQ: And President Putin today was accusing the Obama administration of spreading false information about the President-elect in an attempt to delegitimize his presidency and said that those in this administration who did that were worse than prostitutes. Does the Obama administration have any comment on that?\nMR. EARNEST: That's an interesting metaphor that he chose there. Listen, as I've said on a number of occasions, the men and women of the United States intelligence community are patriots. They are experts in their field. They do their work not because of the glory associated with it -- because most of the time they have to keep their names secret. They don't do it for the big pay -- because in many situations they could make a whole lot more money in the private sector. They do their important work to keep our country safe because they love this country, and they have served us incredibly well in keeping us safe.\nThey have served President Obama enormously well. And this is not the first time that the intelligence community has had some uncomfortable things to say about Russia. These are the kinds of the things that I'm sure the Russians would rather not hear. But ultimately -- and this is something that the next administration is going to have to decide -- there's a pretty stark divide here.\nOn one side, you've got the men and women of the United States intelligence community. You've got Democrats in Congress -- you've got Republicans in Congress -- who are concerned, deeply, about the way that the Russian apparatus sought to call into question the legitimacy and stability of our democracy. On the other side, you've got Wikileaks and the Russians. And the incoming administration is going to have to decide which side they're going to come down on. And it will be among the very interesting things that all of you will be closely watching in the next week.\nQ: I was wondering as you were reflecting over the last eight years whether you can identify the greatest achievement that you felt you were able to accomplish, and also the biggest regret that you have as you're leaving this part of your life.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are two things that come to mind. The first is that, over the course of the eight years that I've worked here in the White House, the President's communication team walked in this building at a time of dramatic change in the media environment, in the news business, thanks largely to advancements in technology, and updating and modernizing and capitalizing on those new opportunities was an important part of President Obama's success in the White House.\nI cite this example because I think it's a good one as you all consider the relationship that you're going to build with the incoming administration. It's a good example because some of the things that we've heard from the incoming administration has raised some concerns, at least based on what I've read publically.\nSome of the things that we tried to do -- capitalizing on new technology, breaking news on Twitter, having the President film videos that we released on Facebook, having the President engage in conversations that were released to the public with people who aren't journalists but people who have a strong following nonetheless, whether that's somebody like Marc Maron or any of the YouTube personalities that President Obama has an opportunity to visit with. Bear Grylls would fit in this category -- all of that was disconcerting to people in this room and was the source of some friction between our operations. But those changes were beneficial to the American people, and to this President, and to this White House. Because in a changing environment, we need to capitalize on every available opportunity to make sure that the President's voice and his message is heard, and those were good opportunities to do that.\nSo my hope is that, as you all navigate this new relationship, that you'll protect the things that are worth protecting -- protecting this daily briefing, and the regular exchange that senior officials have at the White House with all of you to answer tough questions, to be held accountable, to respond for calls for greater transparency.\nIt's uncomfortable to be in a position of authority, certainly a position of responsibility, and to be subjected to those kinds of questions. That's true even when you're doing the right thing for the right reasons. But it's a necessary part of our democracy. And so my hope is that the essence of this relationship between the White House Press Corps and the White House Press Office will be preserved and it will be maintained for future generations to benefit from.\nBut there also was a good reason not just to -- there's also a good reason to not just raise objections because proposed changes depart from the way we've been doing things for a long time. The fact that we've been doing something the same way for a long time is not, in and of itself, a good reason to keep doing things the same way.\nSo this is going to require a lot of hard work, probably going to require building some trust. But I'm optimistic that the White House Press Corps and the White House Press Office can continue to adapt to the modern environment even as some of the basics and this important principle continues to be protected. And I feel like we've navigated that pretty well, and that certainly was an important part of my responsibilities here, both in my first five and half years as the Deputy White House Press Secretary and certainly in the last two-and-a-half as the Press Secretary.\nAnd with regard to things that I could have done better, you can probably point to an exchange in every briefing transcript and find a place where I could have said it more cleanly or more effectively or more clearly, so I'm sure there are many of them.\nThe one example that always comes to mind when I'm asked about this is in early September, the first week in September of 2015, we were in the midst of negotiating -- or working with Congress to protect the Iran deal. You'll recall that there was an opportunity for Congress to vote to pass a resolution of disapproval of the agreement, and we were working hard to build a veto-proof minority in Congress to protect the President's veto of that resolution of disapproval. And quickly, our attention turned to actually building a substantial support in the Senate to allow that agreement to survive a filibuster.\nAnd I inadvertently announced Senator Warner's support for the Iran deal before he has announced it. So our leg staff wasn't too happy with me. Senator Warner wasn't too happy with me. But when I called Senator Warner shortly after the briefing to apologize, I explained to him that it was an honest mistake, and I avoided, with one exception, doing briefings after a red-eye flight, which I suspect contributed to that error back in September of 2015.\nBut the one thing that I do feel good about, and the thing that I'm proud of, and this is a lot -- a lot of credit goes to some of the people that I mentioned at the beginning -- I always felt well-prepared when I was standing up here, and I always felt prepared to tell the truth and to give you as clear a sense as possible the President's thinking on a particular issue. And in some ways, that's the most important mandate of the person that's standing up here. And I'm proud of the way that we fulfilled that.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, first of all, on behalf of the White House Correspondents Association, we want to thank you for your commitment to regular briefings with us. We haven't always agreed on everything, and there has always been some tension, which is normal between a White House and the press corps that covers it, but we are grateful to you and your team for working with the Correspondents Association and for your commitment to dealing with us on a daily basis. So, thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nQ: That hat off, I would ask you a question today about Iran.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: The Iranian President said today that President-elect Trump cannot unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and has said it was meaningless what the President-elect has said about that. Has the Obama administration offered any assurances to the Iranian government about that? And, logistically, is it true, or is it not true, that President-elect Trump could, in fact, nullify the deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are not any -- you've heard the President say this on a number of occasions -- there are not any assurances that this administration has made to foreign leaders about what the incoming administration would do. The incoming President will determine what he believes is the best course for the country, and he'll make that decision accordingly.\nWith regard to the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, this is not just an agreement between the United States and Iran. This is an agreement between Iran and some of our closest allies, and some countries with whom we don't regularly get along on every issue but serve on the United Nations Security Council, and all of those other countries are committed to this agreement because it does prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nYou'll recall that this was one of the foremost foreign policy challenges facing this President when he took office. The world was deeply concerned about the rapid progress that Iran was making toward building a nuclear bomb. And that progress was halted and rolled back because of the tough, principled diplomacy that we initiated and implemented over years to reach this point.\nAnd, in fact, just yesterday, the General Director of the IAEA, Mr. Amano, issued a statement, and I'm just going to read a couple sentences. \"Iran has removed excess centrifuges and infrastructure from the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, in line with its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\" That's the international agreement.\nThe JCPOA required Iran, within one year from implementation day, to complete the removal of all excess centrifuges and infrastructure from the Fordow fuel enrichment plant and to transfer them to storage at the Natanz fuel enrichment plant, under continuous Agency monitoring. That's a remarkable step. You will recall the dramatic moment in September of 2009 when President Obama, with other world leaders, announced to the world this secret nuclear facility that Iran had constructed and was using to advance toward a nuclear weapon.\nSo this is an agreement that's worked. It's an agreement that's going to require conscientious implementation; it's going to require continued diplomacy. We're going to need to work with the rest of the international community to make sure that Iran is adhering to the commitments that they've made. But after doing that for a year, we've gotten proof of concept. This has worked.\nAnd as the incoming President considers the best path forward, we're hopeful, and even optimistic, that he'll consider the success of the last year as he designs a policy for the years ahead.\nQ: The President has made a slew of appointments this week in his last few days in office to places like the Kennedy Center Honors -- the Kennedy Center Board, and others. Why is this happening now? And do you have any ethical concerns about doing this sort of on the way out?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. I think the list of people that the President has put forward for these important positions speaks for themselves. These are outstanding members of the community, some of whom have served this President and this White House, and have done so with extraordinary distinction. And these are new and different ways for them to serve that appeal to their own personal interests. So I think this is -- I know this is entirely consistent with what previous Presidents have done. This is entirely consistent with the executive authority that's vested in the White House. And President Obama is executing that authority consistent with the best interests of the American people.\nQ: Lastly, do you have any reaction to British Prime Minister May's announcement today that Britain will exit the single market when it leaves the European Union?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, what we've been saying from the beginning is that the United States was going to be encouraging both the leaders of the EU and the leaders in the UK to work effectively together to design a relationship among these critically important American allies. And we've urged them to engage in that process in a way that is as transparent as possible to prevent any sort of economic disruptions from misunderstandings or from surprises. And both sides have worked to do that.\nBut ultimately, it's going to be up to them to design a relationship that is supported by their constituents. That certainly is going to make these kinds of conversations more complicated. But this reflects the will of the people as the British people voted in a referendum last summer. And there's a lot of hard work that their elected representatives need to do to design a relationship with the EU that serves them best. And it's firmly in the interest of the United States for them to do that effectively, and we certainly have supported them as they've done that over the last several months, and I anticipate the incoming administration will do the same.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just two for you. Piggybacking on Jeff's question, one of the posts you guys announced is an ambassadorial nominee to the Republic of Congo. I can't imagine you think that is going to get confirmed. What's the rationale behind that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I think it's a couple of things. The first is, you never know. Second is -- so you're saying there's a chance? (Laughter.) That's a fun movie. I probably should have spent more time quoting from \"Dumb and Dumber.\" (Laughter.) I guess that would have been a regret of my two-and-a-half-year tenure here.\nI think the other thing, in some cases, this is also sending a clear signal to Congress about who are people who are qualified for these jobs. And so this can send a clear signal both in terms of their career trajectory, even if they're not confirmed for these positions, but that the President has got a lot of confidence in their ability to handle significant responsibilities. And so even if they are not confirmed for the position that they've been nominated for, there may be future opportunities in a similar area where they could continue to serve the United States.\nBut we've obviously talked a lot about how there are many deserving, worthy, talented Americans who have been put forward by this administration and who have been treated in breathtakingly unfair ways by Republicans in Congress. And that is a source of deep disappointment that we continue to feel even in our last days in office here.\nQ: And the second one -- on this President's watch, North Korea has moved ahead with its missile program and its nuclear program. Does that weigh on the President's mind? Has he discussed it with the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: I have refrained from getting into the content of the conversations between the two men. What I can say is I know that the President's National Security Council and his national security team has been engaged with the incoming President's team on a range of issues, including on North Korea. So I am confident that this challenge is on the radar screen of the incoming President and his team.\nWith regard to President Obama's work in this area, we have not made as much progress as we would have liked in halting North Korea's nuclear activities that are in violation of a range of international agreements. What we have succeeded in doing, however, is building a rock-solid international consensus, including with countries like Russia and China, about the need to apply further pressure to North Korea to refrain from those kinds of destabilizing, provocative actions. And that's an important step and will serve the incoming administration well as they work on this challenge.\nWhat President Obama has also done is work closely with the civilian and uniformed leadership at the Department of Defense to ensure that our defense posture in the Asia Pacific is able to protect the American people from this threat. So that has involved the deployment of additional ships with anti-ballistic missile capabilities. It has involved the construction of sensitive and sophisticated radar that can be used in conjunction with those systems to protect the American people. And we've worked closely with allies like Japan and South Korea to construct those defenses.\nSo the American people, because of the decisions that have been made by the Commander-in-Chief, are safe from North Korea's current capabilities. But we continue to be concerned about their actions, and we're going to need to work effectively with the international community to address that situation.\nPaul.\nQ: Josh, thanks for your efforts these last few years, first of all --\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nQ: This is sort of a history question. When historians look at Presidents, they often cite, well, they did X, Y and Z. But it's also fair to look at perhaps mistakes, quagmires that Presidents avoided getting into. What did the President sort of avoid, in your judgment, that might have done a lot of harm?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, well, certainly, as you know, with regard to our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, the President has been mindful of the recent lessons of U.S. military entanglements in the Middle East. And the President does not believe that our interests were advanced by the strategy that was employed by the previous administration, and, in fact, he ran for this job in part on his opposition to some of the strategies that had been put in place before.\nAnd the President does believe that the strategy that we've put in place against ISIL is working. We've made important progress in rolling back more than half the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq. We've rolled back a substantial quantity of territory that they previously controlled in Syria. And we did that without a large-scale offensive ground combat operation involving American troops on the ground.\nWhat we have done is we have -- the President has dispatched a much smaller number of U.S. forces, some of whom are in a very -- working in a very dangerous situation, to offer advice and assistance to local forces and regional forces that are fighting for their own region, and fighting for their own country.\nAnd that is a strategy that the President believes is much more likely to lead to long-term success. It's going to build the capacity of these local forces to police their own country and secure their own country.\nThose forces are, of course, augmented by U.S. forces with a range of capabilities -- whether that's U.S. military pilots who can take strikes on ISIL targets or other extremist targets in that region of the world. There are U.S. forces with remarkable capabilities that can carry out raids against high-value targets and can capitalize on troves of intelligence that they may be able to acquire. And it also involves U.S. trainers who are building up the capacity of those forces -- other forces, local forces -- and then supporting them, advising them, and assisting them on the battlefield.\nSo that's the strategy that President Obama has put in place. He believes that has served the country well, both because of how it has been effective in taking the fight to ISIL, and because of the likely long-term success that the President believes that we are on track to enjoy. And all that was done without the kind of large-scale ground combat operation that characterized previous entanglements in the Middle East.\nQ: So the footnotes answer is you avoid a foreign quagmire, is what you're saying.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I think that's true -- even as we engage in a robust defense of the American people. That's what has to come first. And, in fact, the President believes that our national security does benefit from a strategy that avoids quagmires, but does apply intense pressure to those extremist organizations that would do us harm. That's the crux of the strategy, and it's worked.\nQ: The second question is, if you look at, say, Gallup polling for every President from Truman up to your boss, he is leaving with actually the fourth highest approval of all of them. John F. Kennedy is exempted. Clinton, then Reagan, then Eisenhower with 59 -- and then your boss. And he's ahead of everybody else. How does that -- does that strike you as about -- how do you react to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that obviously I think is -- I know that President Obama is proud of that and I think it is an indication of -- certainly of the success that we've had in just the last couple of years.\nQ: I mean, his critics say, well, he doesn't deserve that. Others say -- you know how it is. People say it's --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there will be people on both sides who will do their own analysis of the polls. Look, it's not just the Gallup Poll that indicates the uniquely high standing that's enjoyed by the President right now. So we're obviously proud of that. I do think it's a testament to a lot of work that we've done here over the last 12 to 18 months. But it's also a reflection of the kind of early investments that President Obama made in the first couple of years of his presidency that have taken root and are now flowering -- at the risk of torturing that analogy.\nThere are remarkable benefits that -- just one example. President Obama, in his first couple of months in office, made a politically unpopular decision to rescue the American auto industry. That was a decision -- a policy decision that did not poll well in the state of Michigan, a state that had more to benefit from that rescue than any other state in the country when it comes to their economy. But since the President made that important decision, the manufacturing sector has created 800,000 jobs. And the American auto industry is manufacturing and selling as many cars as they ever have.\nSo that's I think a good example of how a tough decision that the President made early on was not one that was going to show immediate benefits, butb looking back, eight years later, it was clearly the right decision. And the fact that it wasn't politically popular at the time, I think only gives people more confidence that the President was making the right decisions for the right reasons.\nMichelle.\nQ: Josh, we've heard one member of Congress call Donald Trump not a legitimate President. Now the number of Democrats who aren't attending the inauguration is up over 40, and they're sort of framing this as a boycott. What do you think of those words and actions? And is this just contributing to the division right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think it's contributing to the division, but I do think it's a reflection of the division in the country right now.\nTo be clear about the President's point of view, since the day after the election, some eight hours after the final results were called, President Obama spoke in the Rose Garden and he spoke forcefully, with conviction, about the determination that he and his team would show in trying to facilitate a smooth and effective transition with the incoming team. And we've lived up to that promise that the President made on November 9th. And in many ways, I think actions speak louder than words, particularly with regard to the way this administration has worked closely with the incoming administration to ensure -- or at least give them the best opportunity at a running start.\nBut all of that was rooted in the institutional responsibilities that the President and his team have to serve the American people, is to make sure that the person that they've elected President of the United States has an opportunity to succeed and hit the ground running. And we have been challenged to do that in spite of our in some cases profound concerns with some of the rhetoric and policy positions that are being articulated by the other side.\nSo I think most of this, Michelle, is just a function of the different roles. Members of Congress have a different responsibility. They are freer to express their opinion in a way that they chose. They don't have the same kind of institutional responsibility that the administration has. And I'm proud of the fact that we've fulfilled it.\nQ: You're saying that the administration would say similar things and do similar things if they could?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't speculate on what people around here would say. I think I'm just pointing to what we have done. And that's a reflection of keeping the President's promise.\nQ: You've spoken a lot about the efforts, like the strong efforts that the administration has put out for this smooth transition. So do you think that these -- do you think it's important what these -- some of these Democrats are saying and doing? Do you think it's important for that to be said at this point? Or do you think that what they're doing is just sort of harming the smooth transition?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't think that what they're doing is harming the smooth transition, primarily because when we're talking about a smooth transition, we're talking about making sure that the incoming administration is aware of what we've been doing over the last eight years and of the looming decisions that they'll have to make when they enter office. We want to make sure that they can benefit from all of the lessons that we've learned over the last eight years about building and running an effective team that's in charge of the federal government.\nThose are the kinds of things that are critical to a smooth and effective transition, and I don't think that there's anything that members of Congress have said that's going to derail that effort.\nQ: Okay. And there's been plenty that has been said about certain posts that will possibly be open for a long time, certain structures just not seeming ready at all. I mean, we hear things on our end about concerns within the administration as to the next administration's readiness. So you've had a unique look at that smooth transition that you mentioned. Do you think that there's readiness there? I mean, do you feel confident that the next administration is ready to pick up the reins?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly am not in a position to be able to assess across the board what the level of readiness is of the incoming team. I'll let them describe what efforts they have taken to ensure that they're ready to assume this awesome responsibility. And we certainly have tried to be there at every turn as they're making those decisions to support them and to give them the best possible information so that they can make the best possible decision. But when it comes to assessing where things stand, I'll leave that to the incoming team.\nQ: And do you feel like this is the last briefing of this kind that we might see for a very long time?\nMR. EARNEST: I hope not, but I don't know. I'll let the incoming team speak to that.\nJustin.\nQ: The President-elect said on Friday that U.S. companies can't compete because our currency was too strong and that that was \"killing us.\" I'm wondering if that's a concern that the White House shares.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have, over the last eight years, abided by the longstanding tradition of allowing the United States Secretary of the Treasury to speak about the value of the dollar. Of course, those policy decisions when it relates to currency are made by the Federal Reserve, so that's not something I've spoken on at great length here.\nI did happen to see the President-elect's comments. I believe there is one factual point that is worth referencing, which is that we have seen with regard to China's currency that it is appreciating in value over the last 18 months. That's just a fact. With regard to what sort of policy they've implemented to do that or what their aim may be, I'd refer you to the Chinese. I wouldn't speculate on that. But just as a factual matter, the Chinese currency has appreciated over the last year to 18 months.\nQ: Are you concerned that an aide to the President-elect reportedly was in discussions about joint investments -- (inaudible)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen those specific reports. I think what I can say is that given the intelligence community's conclusion about the efforts of the Russians to intervene in our democracy, questions about the ties between senior government officials and the Russian government are worthy of careful examination.\nAnd that will obviously be the responsibility of Congress, and it may end up being the responsibility of some law enforcement officials if they choose to initiate those kinds of investigations. If they choose to do that, that would be a decision that they would make entirely on their own based on their own discretion and not something that this administration would try to influence even in our last few days here.\nBut there are structures in place where people have the authority that they need to conduct those kinds of investigations. And with regard to Congress, they'll face a decision about whether or not they choose to exercise that authority. And with regard to law enforcement officials, they'll have to decide on their own if this is worthy of an inquiry.\nQ: Last one. Your friend, Senator Schumer -- (laughter) -- suggested --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm really hoping that he accepted that opening in the spirit in which it was offered. We'll see, I guess. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- suggested today that Representative Price might have broken the law on this stock transaction of a medical device -- and he later introduced legislation that could have governed. Acknowledging what you said before that the President-elect should have some flexibility to pick his own team, do you find this report to be disqualifying for the President-elect's choice as head of HHS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this report is indicative of a couple of things. The first is, given the incoming administration's priority that is placed on draining the swamp, I think they have the unique obligation to explain exactly what happened. Because the facts of the report don't appear to be that complicated -- you have a member of Congress buying a stock in a company, and within a week sponsoring legislation that would benefit that company and its stock price, only to see the introduction of that legislation followed shortly thereafter by a political donation from that company to the campaign account of the member of Congress in question.\nSo this doesn't seem like a complicated scheme. It seems like exactly the kind of financial entanglement that's left a lot of people feeling alienated from Washington, D.C., that's left a lot of people questioning the motives of members of Congress. Was he sponsoring that legislation because of his own personal motive -- personal financial interest? Was he sponsoring that legislation because he knew it was likely to lead to a political contribution? Or was he sponsoring that bill because he thought it was good policy? It's hard to know. It's an open question.\nSo this is why Congress has a responsibility to offer advice and consent for the President's Cabinet nominations. And I suspect this is going to be an issue that's going to receive careful scrutiny -- hopefully not just on the part of Democrats, but also on the part of Republicans who are interested in making sure that the incoming President's Cabinet nominees are looking to do the job for the right reasons.\nJon.\nQ: So are you suggesting he may have broken the law?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm saying that I don't know whether or not\n-- I certainly can't make a statement that definitive. If law enforcement officials choose to investigate the situation, that's something that they will do based on their own knowledge of the law and based on their own discretion. I think I'm just commenting on the fact that reports do raise a lot of questions. And again, this isn't some sort of complicated financial scheme. We don't need to have Michael Lewis explain it to us in a 300-page book. This one seems pretty concerning just based on a couple paragraphs of a news report from CNN.\nQ: Okay. I've got a couple questions. First, I just want to say thank you, Josh, for being accessible during your time here as Press Secretary and Deputy Press Secretary, and thank you for working as hard as you have to answer our questions, including, but not exclusively, those questions that you didn't like. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: There were more than a few of those. (Laughter.) Thank you for your kind words, Jon. I appreciate it.\nQ: Back to the question Josh asked about Vladimir Putin, putting aside the intelligence community. Putin made a specific allegation, pretty explosive one, coming from another global leader. He's accusing the Obama administration of trying to delegitimize the incoming Trump administration. What's your response to Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: First of all, it sounds like he got his copy of the talking points. Second --\nQ: From whom?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know. But it certainly sounds a lot like what the incoming administration's team is saying. But it is not the first time that the Russian President has called into question the veracity of the United States government. Right?\nThis is a Russian government that recently said that they were focused entirely on ISIL inside of Syria, and raising questions about what the United States and our allies were doing to fight those extremists. That wasn't true. In fact, what we know is that the one place that Russia can point to where they've made progress against ISIL is in Palmyra; ISIL has since taken it back and is now using some of the equipment that the Syrian regime, with the support of the Russians, moved to Palmyra. And that's going to put the United States and our coalition partners who are going after ISIL at even greater risk.\nSo it's not the first time that the President of Russia has said things about the U.S. government that just don't withstand any scrutiny.\nQ: So it's not true?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course, it's not true. And the suggestion -- the reason that I answered Josh's question the way that I did was that the suggestion all along -- and this is a suggestion that was repeated just yesterday by the President-elect -- was raising doubts about the integrity and intentions of the men and women of the intelligence community. And that is deeply misguided, as I've said before.\nAnd particularly to call into question the integrity of somebody like John Brennan, somebody who has served at the CIA for three decades, somebody who served this country in dangerous locations around the world to try to keep us safe -- I'm offended by it.\nQ: Josh, on the question of the next administration and its communication strategy, looking back, was there ever any consideration by anybody in this White House of shutting this briefing room down, of taking reporters and moving them out of the West Wing?\nMR. EARNEST: No, there was not.\nQ: What would it say, symbolically and practically -- what message would it send to the country if this briefing room, if this workspace were shut down and reporters were banished to another part of the White House grounds?\nMR. EARNEST: I lead this in my long comments at the beginning about how the United States has a rather unique arrangement between our government and the independent media. The fact that all of you represent independent news organizations and have regular access to the White House, have regular access to workspace where you can do your job, have a venue where you can enter the room -- the Briefing Room -- at almost any hour, and can hold people in power accountable is really important.\nYou also have access to senior White House officials right through that door. Right up the ramp outside that door, you can come into my office at a moment's notice to ask question and demand answers and demand transparency. And as I mentioned earlier, sometimes that's a little inconvenient; sometimes it's uncomfortable; sometimes it's frustrating because you're dissatisfied with the answer that was given, but it's necessary for the success of our democracy.\nAnd I think there are some people who might say, Jon, that, well, this is -- it's just symbolic that you have the White House Press Corps in the White House. And I would say it's a really important symbol. It's more than just symbolism. But even taking that argument at face value, there is something symbolically important about all of you gathering here every single day to hold people in power accountable, to demand answers, to demand transparency, to demand facts. And your ability to do that is going to be affected if you don't have regular access to the White House, if you're not able to do your job from the White House, and if there's not a natural, readily available venue for you to hold senior officials accountable.\nSo this is, again, a relationship that President Obama believed was important to invest in. He made this a priority, and it doesn't mean because he liked all your coverage.\nQ: He could have had more press conferences --\nMR. EARNEST: He probably could have. And again, I think this is exactly a good illustration -- you should be asking for more, and you should say that we appreciate President Obama's investment, but there is more that he could have done. That's the nature of this relationship. And it means that you're doing your job, but it also means the President of the United States is doing his job. And I don't know if the incoming administration is going to see it that way, but I hope they do.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, one of your, I guess, mentees -- mentors, Mike McCurry said the press had a friendly, adversarial relationship with the White House. And with that, understanding your very interesting position between the press and the President, have you taken any kind of advocacy role positives about what you just said to Sean Spicer, the incoming press secretary, or has anyone in this administration talked to the incoming administration about exactly what you just said?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is, as you know, my colleague, Jen Psaki and I had an opportunity to visit with Mr. Spicer in what will soon be his new office a couple of weeks ago. And we had a nice conversation. And we talked about everything from the rather peculiar logistics of getting things done around the White House, but also the work to prepare for the briefing and to ensure that government agencies are coordinated in their messaging efforts with the White House. It was a good conversation. But one of the pieces of advice that I had for him was to engage with the White House Correspondents Association.\nI remember vividly when we started here. I was the deputy press secretary during President Obama's earliest days in office. And we worked very closely at the time with Jennifer Loven, who was an AP correspondent and then was president of the White House's Correspondents Association. And she did an excellent job of helping to educate us about what your expectations were and she helped us avoid inadvertent conflicts. There are certainly situations where we might be tempted to do something that we didn't think was that big of a deal that you all would view with deep suspicion as an effort to make your job harder.\nAnd so what I encouraged Sean to do is to engage with the gentlemen that all of you have elected to represent you as the President of the White House Correspondents Association. So Jeff is somebody who knows this place well, and Jeff is somebody who can be an honest broker. And so he's got a -- Jeff and I actually had this conversation before the election about how valuable our relationship with Jennifer Loven was in 2009, and how his relationship with the incoming administration -- whether it was the Clinton administration or the Trump administration -- was going to be critically important.\nAnd, look, Jeff knows his stuff and he's got exactly the right temperament for managing these kinds of things. And I do think that if Jeff, as your elected representative, and Sean, as the person designated as the top spokesperson in the government by the President-elect, can work effectively together, that I think a lot of the concerns that have been expressed in the last couple of weeks can certainly be managed.\nAnd it doesn't mean that everything he does is going to be satisfying to you; it shouldn't be that way. But I am optimistic that because of Sean's genuine desire to represent his boss well and Jeff's leadership in representing all of your interests, that these difficult things can get worked out.\nQ: Did you specifically say we should stay in this building, stay here?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into a detailed readout of our conversation. So I'm going to defer to him and let him announce what they choose to do.\nQ: I have a couple of other questions really fast. Being here all these years and being with the President since Iowa, meeting him since Iowa, what is the biggest takeaway as people are trying to rewrite his history now and trying to look at his legacy when you're supposed to look, like, 10 years out? What's the biggest takeaway that we should know about this administration, and particularly this President?\nMR. EARNEST: I alluded to this at the top, too. In 2007, when I first heard President Obama speak as a candidate for President of the United States, I actually wasn't working for him. I moved to Iowa in December of 2006 to work on Tom Vilsack's presidential campaign. And so I joined President Obama's team, then-Senator Obama's team, only a month or so after Governor Vilsack dropped out of the race.\nAnd the reason that I was drawn to Senator Obama's campaign was simply that he was giving voice to a vision of the country that deeply resonated with me. He was articulating a vision for America that was inclusive, where everybody got a fair shot and a fair shake, and where we tried to transcend a politics that seemed too small, that it was not well-equipped to take on the difficult challenges that our country faced. And he was willing to articulate that vision and those set of values, and defend them forcefully.\nThere was a sense among many Democrats, particularly throughout much of the Bush administration, that Democrats were a little on the back foot in trying to make our argument. And to see this young and young-looking man, a newcomer on the scene, step up to the stage and almost defiantly articulate a vision of the country where everybody has got a shot, regardless of what you look like or where you come from, that there's a whole lot more that unites us than drives us apart in this country because of our commitment to some of the basic founding principles of our country -- that resonated with me.\nAnd so to answer your question, my takeaway is that for all that we've been through, for all that we've seen over the last decade, President Obama is as optimistic about the country and as committed to that vision as he has ever been. And he is as resolute in advocating for and defending those values as he's ever been. And I find that genuinely inspiring, at the risk of laying it on a little thick. I genuinely do.\nOn those days when I thought it was -- when I was tired, knowing that I was going to have to get up early in the morning and prepare to come and speak to all of you, I drew a lot of inspiration from knowing what a unique opportunity it was for me to have the opportunity to stand up here and to give voice to those values that I deeply believe in, and to know that my boss would support me in making that argument forcefully, without reservation, with deep conviction.\nIt's been an honor to do that. But mostly I admire and respect the President's fidelity to those values even through all the twists and turns of the last 10 years.\nQ: And lastly, you talk about laying it on thick. I guess I want to say thank you for making sure that issues that were not necessarily the mainstream issues -- urban America, LGBT community, all sorts of communities out there that were not necessarily at the top of the fold or on the A block of the news -- for making sure we have answers for that. How important is that for this White House to make sure those issues were addressed as well as the overarching issues of the day from the first two rows?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is actually a principle that the incoming administration has given some voice to -- that I know that Mr. Spicer has indicated a desire to be as inclusive as possible and to give as many different kinds of journalists and outlets and commentators the opportunity to participate in this session. I think that's a really good thing. That's exactly what we have done. There's never been a time that we've turned anybody away from participating in this briefing. People who show up here on a regular basis with their hand in the air, regardless of which row they sit in -- they get called on. Not every day -- (laughter.) In part because it's not unusual for me to get complaints about the length of the briefing. But it's fair to say that people who show up here regularly get called on regularly.\nThat's a good thing. And if that's something that Mr. Spicer is committed to, and he wants to bring even more people into that process, people from the left and the right, we've certainly succeeded in doing that, and I hope he does, too.\nAnita.\nQ: Thank you. A couple questions about Friday. So I know a few of the -- several -- three former Presidents are going to be in town, and Secretary Clinton, obviously. Is there any opportunity for the President to visit with the former Presidents there or at the Capitol or at the White House, or does that not happen?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any sort of formal get-together that the President will have with the former Presidents. I wouldn't be surprised if there is an opportunity when they're at the Capitol for the President to see them, but it would just be pretty informal. And we'll do our best to keep you posted about how that shakes out.\nQ: -- in my colleague's profile of you, which came out today, that your last day is actually Thursday. Does that mean most staff -- I know some people, it's staggered that people are leaving, but does most of the staff leave on Thursday if they don't -- aren't involved in the actual --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. The vast majority of the White House staff will have their last day here at the White House on Thursday. There is a small number of people that will continue to work through noon on Friday for the actual transition.\nBut it's a pretty remarkable exercise that we're undergoing here at the White House, and I give a lot of credit to my colleagues at the GSA and other people who are responsible for ensuring that I have an opportunity to work from my desk until 4 or 5 o'clock at night in the evening on Thursday, and they're going to have that office up and running and prepared for Sean to sit down behind that desk at noon the next day. So that's no small undertaking, but it certainly requires that many of us get out of the way on Thursday afternoon so they can do their important work.\nQ: You mentioned the President was going to California after the inauguration -- or the family is going. When they return -- so they fly aboard the presidential aircraft, which we don't call Air Force One then. Does it wait for them, or are they on their own after that -- they can take commercial back?\nMR. EARNEST: They're on their own after that. I don't know what their travel plans are, but that will be the President's final trip aboard the presidential aircraft, so it will be to --\nQ: Do you know how long they're going to be there?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any details about their time in Palm Springs and I don't anticipate that that will be released.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, you said you didn't think that boycotting the inauguration was really going to harm the peaceful transition, but is the President actively discouraging Democrats from boycotting, or would he discourage Democrats from boycotting the inauguration?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that he has had a conversation discouraging people from participating in the inauguration. And I'm not sure what he would say if he was asked if he would encourage people to do that. Maybe you'll get a chance to ask him that tomorrow.\nQ: On two things actually, related to Russia. Ambassador Power gave a speech today talking about U.S.-Russia. She repeatedly used the phrase, \"a willingness to lie\" on behalf of Russia and that it's actually a strategic deny-and-lie strategy they have. Does President Obama feel that Vladimir Putin consistently lied to him? I mean, is that how the President would characterize his relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what Ambassador Power is making reference to are the public pronouncements that we've seen from the Russian government that routinely fly in the face of the facts on the ground. I laid out the example to John with the situation in Syrian. The example of Russian activity in Ukraine also applies. Russia has steadfastly denied the presence of Russians in Ukraine who are actively working with separatists to try to undermine the central government in Ukraine.\nSo this is a tactic that we have seen form the Russians with regard to their public communications. When the President has discussed his personal communications with Vladimir Putin, the President has indicated that President Putin is pretty blunt and businesslike. And I think there's only one time that I participated in one of those meetings and that was my observation as well.\nQ: You agree he was blunt?\nMR. EARNEST: I would. I would.\nQ: But you would not say that he feels that in those conversations Putin has ever lied?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think I can account for all of the conversations between President Obama and President Putin. I would just say that President Obama has often said that public perception about his behind-the-scenes interactions with President Putin aren't usually correct, that they do have pretty businesslike interactions and President Putin is pretty blunt in those conversations.\nAnd what Ambassador Power was obviously referring were some of the public communications that we've seen from the Russians to say things about their activities that just aren't true.\nQ: There have been reports last week about the Israelis, this week about British intelligence, suggesting that their conversations with the CIA asking for reassurance that known assets in Russia would not be shared by the incoming administration with Moscow. In other words, asking the U.S. to keep its secrets secret. Is that something that the White House has been aware of? Are those reports in any way accurate? And is that kind of request appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any of the conversations that our intelligence community has had with some of our closest allies. I'll let them describe those conversations.\nThe United States has worked hard to deepen our cooperation with the United Kingdom and the rest of our NATO allies for that matter, certainly as it relates to intelligence gathering. Our ability to collect that intelligence and share it widely among our partners does make our alliance stronger. And it makes our collective defense more effective. But I can't speak to any specific instructions or requests that the British intelligence services may have made to American intelligence services.\nQ: And lastly, you said you wouldn't characterize the readiness of the incoming administration. Secretary Kerry did publicly suggest that he was -- the contact had been minimal with at least the incoming Secretary of State, should he be confirmed. Would you say that the incoming administration has taken up the Obama administration in all of its offering to fully brief and fully read in the nominees?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, I think the thing that was evident to all of you in the earliest days of the transition is that the Trump administration had a pretty steep hill to climb with regard to their learning curve. Is some of that related to the fact that they weren't anticipating winning the election? Probably. But I think what we have seen over that time is conscientious, painstaking work on the part of the incoming administration to try to get up to speed. And there has been substantial improvement in those efforts since the days immediately following the election.\nI obviously can't speak to all of the conversations across the federal government. But it's certainly fair for you to conclude that the capacity and capability of the incoming team has improved markedly since the first days after the election.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh, for the final time. I wanted to ask you about a report in The Washington Post yesterday that said the President plans to make several hundred commutations before his final day. Can you confirm that's the plan?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw that report. I don't have any news to announce from here with regard to any commutations. But if there are any clemency requests that are granted, we'll make sure you're among the first to hear about them.\nQ: Yet last week you made an interesting argument about the differences between Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. Can you at this point rule out that the President will give a pardon to Edward Snowden?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't rule anything in or out. I think the one thing that the Department of Justice has said -- I'm looking at Brandi, and she's giving me the poker face. (Laughter.) I believe what the Department of Justice has said is that -- there you go. What they have said and what Brandi has told me is that -- (laughter) -- Mr. Snowden has not filed paperwork to seek clemency from the administration. But I don't have any specific comments about whether or not that would impact any sort of presidential-level decision.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the note of pardons, the administration has been very proud of its ethical record. And as we've seen in the past, some of these last-minute pardons can kind of trip some people up. And so will -- the clemency initiative, there's sort of a structure for those. But with the pardons, will the President issue all his pardons at a point where we're still able to ask for an explanation about them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I would say is simply that we're aware of the history that you've alluded to. The President has been judicious about using this authority in a way that he believes is consistent with American interests and the pursuit of justice. And if we feel it is ever necessary for us to make that case, we'll want to make sure that we have ample opportunity to make it.\nI think I'll leave it there.\nQ: And can you just offer any more details about the President's last day, his last hours in office? Will he still get the presidential daily briefing? Can you tell us who specifically is actually going to be showing up here on the 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: You mean in terms of staff?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have that in front of me, but we will provide you with some contact information for the morning of the 20th should you need it.\nQ: I'm just mean in terms of what he's doing. Like is Chief of Staff McDonough going to be here? NSC Advisor?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll work to see if we can compile some of those details. I don't have a lot of detailed information about that right now, but we'll see if can get you something in advance of Friday.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. And despite our differences, thank you for being fair.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Kevin. I appreciate that.\nQ: And your staff is great, too, as well.\nMR. EARNEST: I appreciate it.\nQ: Regardless of the clemency issue, is it fair to say that the process is still ongoing at this stage? The review, is that still happening even today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, this is a process that largely lives at the Department of Justice, and they've been very focused on this important work. They're working closely with the President's attorneys here in the White House. And, yes, it is fair to say that that work continues.\nQ: I want to ask specifically about Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, in particular. As it relates to Chelsea Manning, does the White House agree that Manning is being subjected to unfair treatment by the Army amid her daily fight to have her right to be identified as a woman? Does the White House agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware that the Commander-in-Chief has weighed in on this. This is obviously complicated by the fact that Chelsea Manning is in the military criminal justice process and, of course, the Commander-in-Chief is at the top of the chain of command, which limits our ability to discuss her case in all that much detail. But I'll look and see if we have ever weighed on this specific question. I know that it certainly is a question and a concern that's been raised by some of Chelsea Manning's advocates.\nQ: And for the record, she was sentenced to 35 years. Does the White House believe that that was a just sentence?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard the President weigh in on that either, again for the same kind of chain-of-command reasons that I just cited.\nQ: But he may tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, if he chooses to -- you and Jordan will be among the first to know. (Laughter.)\nQ: Fair enough. Jordan, I got first dibs. (Laughter.) Let me ask you about Edward Snowden. Does his offer to turn himself in if Manning is, in fact, offered clemency weigh at all in the consideration for how the President might consider a pardon for Manning, or even for Snowden, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: It does not, primarily because we believe that under any circumstances, Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the serious crimes with which he's been charged. He will, of course, be afforded the kind of due process that's available to every American citizen who's going through the criminal justice process. But the crimes that he's accused of committing are serious, and we believe that he should return to the United States and face them rather than seeking refuge in the arms of an adversary of the United States that has their own strategic interests in disseminating harmful -- or disseminating information in a harmful way.\nQ: So for clarity's sake, it seems apparent that there's little doubt that Edward Snowden will not be offered a pardon by this President.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not something that -- I can't rule out any offer of clemency, or rule it in, frankly, from here.\nQ: Based on what you just said, though -- I mean, the President has been pretty clear, he hasn't availed himself to even a conversation about prosecution or facing the charges that he may in fact be forced to face were he even here. So based on that, it seems clear he's not going to get a pardon, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you've heard me note that that is one of the many differences between Mr. Snowden's case and Chelsea Manning's case. But I can't rule anything in or out at this point.\nQ: Last one. I want to ask you about Julian Assange. Did the White House ask Britain or even Ecuador, perhaps, to take action against Julian Assange and/or shut down WikiLeaks at any point? Did that come from this White House?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific request like that that was made. You know that the U.S. intelligence community, and even the President, have expressed some deep concerns about the ties between Russian intelligence and WikiLeaks and other organizations like it that were created to disseminate either classified information or previously private information. And we know that much of those efforts to disseminate that information was rooted in a Republican -- Russian strategy to undermine confidence in American democracy.\nSo we have profound concerns about the way that that organization, WikiLeaks, has operated, and we have expressed profound concerns about the way that some of the things that they have done and some of the information that they have released has harmed our national security, has put our military and our intelligence officers in harm's way and made their dangerous work even more dangerous. But I can't speak to any specific requests that may have been made of the Brits or the Ecuadoreans.\nRon.\nQ: Just to follow up on this -- the appointments of Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice and others to these boards. Are these appointments that cannot be reversed by the President -- the incoming President? And were they made for that reason or with that in mind?\nMR. EARNEST: They weren't made with that in mind. I believe that these are the -- that the appointments on these kinds of boards are part of the President's executive authority and part of his responsibility. And he chose to fill a couple of those positions with two of his most trusted aides.\nQ: So they're probably -- are there terms? Are there -- I guess it would vary depending upon the --\nMR. EARNEST: There are terms, but we can get you the details.\nQ: There's also -- there's an education regulation that's making its way -- I believe it's before the White House Budget Office. You're looking at me like you don't know what I'm talking about.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I do.\nQ: It's a regulation that would essentially change the funding mechanism within school districts and apportion more money to lower-income areas as compared to higher-income areas. The question is where is that, is it going to make it, so on and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me have my colleagues at the Office of Management and Budget circle back with you to give you an update on where that stands.\nQ: And just a last thing -- can you give us any indication of what the President is really doing and focused on these last number of days? I know you were asked about staffing and all that, but --\nMR. EARNEST: Other than saying really nice things about me -- (laughter) -- which I deeply appreciate, by the way?.\nQ: It's a -- I mean, I know he's concerned about national security, I know he's concerned about the transition. But just -- I just wonder, what do you do when you have, like, a few days left after all this?\nMR. EARNEST: There's a lot to be done. Let me tell you at least one thing. This morning, the President assembled senior members of his counterterrorism and homeland security team to review ongoing security planning for the 58th inauguration. The President commended the comprehensive preparations across the law enforcement and intelligence community, and directed that all agencies maintain their high state of vigilance to ensure we are best postured to protect the homeland against individuals radicalized to violence.\nThe President was also briefed on counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Syria that are putting simultaneous pressure on ISIL inside Mosul and around Raqqa. Over the weekend, as you may know, Iraqi security forces made significant gains in Mosul as ISIL defenses are collapsing in key parts of the city. And in northern Syria, local partners continue to constrict ISIL's movement in the vicinity of Raqqa.\nThe President noted the impact our strategy is having on the ground is the result of a deliberate effort to accelerate our campaign against ISIL, and that the coalition is well-postured to put ISIL on a path to lasting defeat.\nI think the fact that the President held this meeting today is an indication that the President continues to be focused first and foremost on the safety and security of the United States and the American people. And this is consistent with the kind of briefing that he has held with his national security team and with intelligence officials before major events. The President typically does this before the holidays; he'll often do this before the Fourth of July. And obviously, with the upcoming inauguration, we want to make sure -- the President wanted to make sure that our security posture was in place to protect the American people.\nQ: That's a Situation Room meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know exactly where this meeting took place, but we can confirm that for you.\nQ: Anything else? Is he -- we've talked about pardons and commutations, and talked about appointments. Is there anything else that we can expect over the next number of hours that are work product, if you will, that the President is trying to get done before he leaves? Even if you can identify some areas. We know he's concerned about immigration. We know he's concerned about social justice. We know he's concerned about a lot of things.\nMR. EARNEST: Right.\nQ: Can you point us to anything that he is, in the final hours, really trying to focus on and get done?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any announcements to preview, but the President has still got a lot of work to do. And even in just the last couple of days here, he's focused on the task at hand, even as he also does some of the other things around the White House, like bidding a fond farewell to members of his staff and other people from across the administration, and also I think spending some time thinking about his own time and his own tenure here. But stay tuned. If there's more, we'll let you know.\nCarol.\nQ: Thank you. I guess I'll follow on that note. Can you give us an update on the President's efforts to close Guantanamo? And are you prepared at this time to just -- say it will remain open Friday afternoon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can confirm -- and I think this is something that you've already reported -- that there was a transfer of 10 detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the government of Oman. With that transfer being completed, there are now 45 detainees at Gitmo. When President Obama took office, the detainee population was at 242, so since that time, we've moved 193 detainees to 42 countries for repatriation, resettlement, or prosecution.\nObviously, that work was a result of the review that President Obama ordered almost exactly eight years ago today to ask the intelligence community and other national security agencies to engage in a case-by-case review of the files of the detainees, and determine if any of them could be transferred to other countries under a set of strict security requirements that would limit their ability to harm the United States. And so that's been an effort that has greatly reduced the prison population.\nAt this point, I don't anticipate that we will succeed in that goal of closing the prison, but it's not for a lack of trying -- that, I assure you. And the only reason it didn't happen is because of the politics that members of Congress in both parties, frankly, played with this issue. And it has put the United States in a position where, because of the obstacles erected by Congress, terrorist organizations have a powerful recruiting tool, and millions in taxpayer dollars are wasted to operate this large facility for 45 people, potentially less.\nThat's not a good use of taxpayer dollars, and it certainly isn't the most effective way to protect our country. And that's not just a conclusion that President Obama has reached, that's a conclusion that's been reached by people like President Bush and senior members of his national security team. So this isn't a partisan issue, and I think the disappointment at Congress's action in this area is also bipartisan in nature.\nQ: Two follow-ups on that. At what point did the President make that determination, that he would not succeed? And do you expect any additional transfers this week?\nMR. EARNEST: The possibility of additional transfers remains a possibility. Look, I think once there was a -- once we'd reach the 30-day deadline for notifying Congress in advance of detainee transfers, the likelihood of succeeding in closing the prison was quite remote.\nQ: One other quick question. Chinese President Xi today delivered a speech in Davos where he gave a defense of globalization and warned against a trade war and protectionism, and this is obviously something the President has spoken a lot about, and I'm curious if you have any reaction to the Chinese President's speech.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't read the text of President Xi's remarks, but certainly based on the news coverage, I think this does surface a central question -- for the American people, for policymakers, for economic leaders, and even national security leaders -- about what role the United States is going to play in the global economy and what role the United States is going to play in Asia Pacific. And President Obama put forward his own strategy, one that sought to deepen our alliances with Australia, South Korea, and Japan that has resulted in a beefed-up military presence in the Asia Pacific, to protect our allies, to deepen our coordination and cooperation with them, and to ensure they're protected from threats that emanate in the region.\nThe President also felt strongly that that intensified security cooperation should be partnered with greater economic integration in that region of the world. Southeast Asia in particular is home to some of the most dynamic economies in the world. These are smaller countries, but they have rapidly growing middle-class populations, and many of the countries who signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement are home to those economies. And the completion of that agreement and the ratification of that agreement by Congress would have given American businesses a better opportunity to compete in that part of the world. That would have been good for our economy and good for our businesses and, most importantly, good for our workers.\nThe agreement would have required other countries to slash 18,000 taxes that they impose on American products. It would have held those countries accountable for raising labor standards, raising human rights standards, raising environmental standards, the kinds of standards that we already observe here. And to shut off the U.S. from those kinds of agreements isn't just a missed opportunity, it actually puts the United States at a greater disadvantage because we're hearing many of those countries indicate a desire to move forward with that agreement.\nSo that means that other countries who have signed on are going to be at an advantage over U.S. products, to say nothing of the role of the Chinese. China would love to come and strike their own agreements with these other countries for the same reasons that we would like to -- because these are some of the fastest-growing economies of the world and they have a rapidly growing middle class that could be available to buy Chinese products. And we know that if the Chinese negotiate a deal, they're not looking to raise human rights standards; they're not looking to raise labor standards; they're not looking to put in place strict, tough intellectual property protections.\nSo the President is deeply disappointed that Congress hasn't moved to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership because of the obvious benefits for the American people. And that's going to have consequences not just for our economy and the success that our country has in confronting the forces of globalization and looking out for the interests of working people, it's also going to have an impact on our national security.\nSo obviously the incoming administration has proposed a different strategy when it comes to countering the forces of globalization. I believe the President's economic record speaks for itself. And all of you will have an opportunity to test just how -- well, whether or not the strategy put forward by the incoming administration works and actually serves the interests of the American people, the American economy, and American workers.\nMark.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Have there ever been days when you've dreaded coming out here? (Laughter.) Or let me put it another way -- have there been days when you didn't dread coming out here? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Let me answer your question this way. There was -- I did the briefing here -- well, I did a briefing like this 354 times as Press Secretary --\nQ: My count is higher.\nMR. EARNEST: Is it higher?\nQ: Yeah.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the stenographers separated out the times that I briefed as the Principal Deputy Press Secretary, so that may account for the difference, but we can look at the numbers.\nQ: I also counted gaggles.\nMR. EARNEST: They did, too. I did almost the same number as both the Press Secretary and as the Deputy.\nQ: I trust Mark's number. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's understandable. That's understandable. In the 354 or so times that I walked into this room, I never took for granted the blessing that was the opportunity to stand here. And most people don't have an opportunity to influence the debate in this way. The arguments that you hear me make, these are President Obama's arguments. This is his vision for the country that I'm advocating for. So I'm not trying to take credit for that.\nBut these are arguments, and this is a vision for the country, and these are values that I passionately believe in. And having the opportunity to influence the way that those arguments are made, to look for ways to deliver them in the most persuasive way that I can think of is an extraordinary intellectual challenge, but it also really gives me an opportunity to shape the debate in a way that few other people in this town have.\nSo there were days when I knew I was going to come out here and get some tough questions, and there were days when I was going to walk back to my office frustrated about how it went, but I never took for granted what an extraordinary opportunity it is to be a part of this process with you and to advocate for a President and a vision that I deeply believe in. And I'm going to miss it. It'll be -- at the risk of oversharing, it'll be hard to -- well, let me say it this way -- (laughter) -- it'll take some getting used to, to seeing somebody else stand up here doing it.\nQ: Or not.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Or not. (Laughter.) And -- but that's --\nQ: Are you going to watch?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll probably watch. I'm interested in what happens in here, and I think it's important for the country. And I'll be paying attention.\nQ: Marlin Fitzwater used to say that after he left that job, he used to love putting his feet up, pouring a glass of wine, and watching someone else face all the questions. (Laughter.) Is that how you think you'll be watching your successor?\nMR. EARNEST: There may be a time or two when schadenfreude creeps in. But look -- again, I've got enormous respect for the work that all of you do and for the conventions that we have erected to engage in this discussion, and it's been an honor to be a part of it. And yeah, I'm interested in what happens here, and I'll continue to follow it. But I will be relieved to not have the burden to follow it as closely as this job has required over the last two-and-a-half years.\nGo ahead, JC.\nQ: It's sort of a personal question and it follows up, I hope, on what Mark was saying. The President alluded earlier that you could possibly have a career on the silver screen. (Laughter.) Many of us -- I believe that. Keep smiling -- that's it. Perfect. And we know that you're not going to require your very patient wife, Natalie, and your son, Walker, to pepper you with tough questions every day between 1:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon. But to follow up, where is your passion going? What would you like to do? And where do you want to follow your dream?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll tell you that I've had this conversation with the President. And one of the challenges of the job is it is all-consuming. It's difficult to remember a day in which the first thing that pops into my head when I open my eyes in the morning -- usually in the dark -- was to wonder what I needed to get done in order to prepare for this briefing, or to fulfill my responsibilities at the White House.\nSo I'm looking forward to having a little bit more time and space, both physically and intellectually, to reflect on this experience and to consider what the future might hold. But I honestly don't know.\nQ: Will you keep us posted?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I'll keep you posted.\nMark.\nQ: Yes, just to clarify two quick things.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: The clemency petitions that have come in, you led us to believe last week that there would be a round, some size, of additional clemencies before the President leaves?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: That is still the case, correct? Whatever size they are.\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that the work on this issue continues, and I certainly wouldn't rule out additional announcements before noon on Friday.\nQ: The President considers this still an important part of his legacy.\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. Absolutely.\nQ: And the President's plans on Friday -- I know you don't want to go into detail about it -- but we're right in calling this a vacation, correct? He's not planning to go out and do speeches right away and meetings and stuff like that.\nMR. EARNEST: That is correct. The President will not be working when he arrives in Palm Springs.\nQ: Perhaps a fair amount of putting and other things?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, and I'm sure that many of you will be disappointed you won't have the opportunity to tag along. (Laughter.)\nScott.\nQ: Is the First Family going to be staying in rental housing?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know where they're going to be staying in Palm Springs, and I doubt we'll announce it in advance.\nQ: And you're leaving your office on Thursday afternoon or evening, but will you and your team will have control of the emails and Twitter and WhiteHouse.gov up until noontime?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there is a plan in place to effect that transition at noon on Friday. I'm not sure exactly how they're going to do that. But it's part of -- it's one of the reasons I have so much admiration for my colleagues who are more technologically inclined than I am.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, a lot, Josh. Congratulations on your 354th briefing, or whatever that number is.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nQ: Given all of your experience in this briefing room, can you talk a little bit from your perspective about the advantages of coming out to the James S. Brady Briefing Room to talk to us on a regular basis?\nMR. EARNEST: This is a place that's recognized immediately around the world as the place where announcements at the White House are made. And again, the symbolic value of this podium in this room in front of all of you is powerful. And it sends a strong message not just to the American people, but to people around the world about what the White House is doing, what the President is focused on, what his priorities are, and how he's seeking to advance our interests.\nSo again, I think that there are a lot of common-sense logistical reasons to preserve the kind of access that all of you have to the West Wing. But I wouldn't overlook the important, symbolic value that makes the arrangement that we have in the United States rather unique.\nQ: As far as statements, which are regularly put out by your office, I didn't notice a statement in regards to the death of Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon. Was that an oversight? Can you talk a little bit about his contribution to our country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I obviously read some of the news coverage about Mr. Cernan's death. And he certainly falls in the category of American hero, somebody who risked his life in the earliest days of the American space program to do remarkable things and inspire the American people to reach for great heights -- reach for great heights. And obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with his family today and those how loved him.\nI can't speak to why there wasn't a presidential statement. But certainly the President and First Lady made note of his death and are remembering him along with some of the other Americans who were inspired by his courage.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On behalf of the foreign press, I also want to thank you. You've been helpful but very welcoming. And all of us, we benefited from your openness so much.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Richard.\nQ: You have to know that all this has been very much appreciated.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nQ: Knowing that there are also many auto plants in Canada, I would like your reaction to the President-elect's comment or intention on imposing a 35 percent tax on German cars being built in Mexico and sold in the U.S.\nMR. EARNEST: Richard, I think this is a pertinent question. The President, on his last trip to Canada over the summer, talked about this very issue.\nThe U.S. auto industry is part of an integrated global supply chain. And the presence of a lot of those suppliers for U.S. automakers is actually in Canada, and it speaks to the important ties between our two countries. And maintaining those robust ties is good for the economy in both our countries; that if you shut down the supply chain or you shut down the trade between the United States and Canada, you're going to cut off the American auto industry from the global supply chain in a way that's going to have direct and negative consequences for American businesses and American workers.\nThat's a real problem. And I think it is an illustration of why President Obama has chosen a different strategy that actually seeks to ensure that other countries, including Canada, are living up to the kinds of high standards that are set here in the United States and were codified in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Canada, of course, was part of those negotiations and signed onto the deal.\nSo the President has spoken out about this at some length. He certainly does believe that the strategy that he has advocated is the right one, but the incoming President has some different ideas in mind. And we'll have an opportunity to assess whether or not his strategy is going to work.\nJean.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You have worked hard as White House press secretary. I deeply appreciate you.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Jean, I appreciate that. That's very kind.\nQ: Can I follow -- ask a question. After you -- whatever -- you go out the White House, can I also ask on those issues?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry, say one more time?\nQ: Can I follow up on the North Korean issues -- continue --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there will be somebody else in the White House who will be setting policy with regard to the United States' relationship with North Korea. And I am hopeful there will be somebody else who is here answering your questions, but I certainly have enjoyed the opportunity that you and I have had to discuss this critically important national security priority of the United States.\nQ: Thank you very much. On THAAD missile issues. Last week, incoming administration (inaudible) and South Korean national security agency director agreed to deploy THAAD missile in South Korea. On this regard, China continues to threaten retaliation against South Korea for THAAD issues. What can the United States do about Chinese actions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has made clear that the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea would be focused solely on countering the missile threat that emanates from North Korea. South Korea is an ally of the United States of America. We are duty-bound to defend them. And President Obama has made clear, and I think the tens of thousands of U.S. troops that are on the ground in Korea right now make clear, that we're going to live up to that promise. And the deployment of a THAAD battery in South Korea would enhance our ability to do exactly that.\nWe've explained that to the Chinese at the highest levels, and we'll continue to go to great lengths to help them understand exactly what we are trying to do. And I know that that is something that is taking place not just at the presidential level, but I know that there have been some conversations through diplomatic channels, military channels to try to ease the concerns of the Chinese that this is an effort that's focused on North Korea and not on having any impact on China's capabilities.\nQ: And one more thing. Recently, high-level diplomat -- North Korean defector, Thae Yong-ho, from UK -- he has testimony, and he said that North Korean Kim Jong-un will (inaudible) nuclear weapons, and that he also said that it is a waste of time for Six-Party talks to (inaudible) the North Korean nuclear weapons. Do you think we still need Six-Party talks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the specific comments of the defector that you cited, but I can tell you it's the United States' policy that the United States is prepared to engage with North Korea diplomatically when they make clear a commitment to a set of principles, including denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. And we've made that clear, and that policy hasn't changed.\nLet's do a couple more here. John.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. And despite differences on things, thanks for your graciousness to me and always helping me on answers, and especially helping some friends of mine when they wanted some things in the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: You're welcome, John. I've enjoyed the opportunity to work with you, as well.\nQ: Thank you. Questions are twofold. First, David Horowitz, the author, has come out with a book entitled \"Big Agenda,\" in which he says that Donald Trump has an agenda to repeal or roll back 90 percent of the executive orders and executive actions that President Obama took in his eight years in office. Your reaction to that? And do you think that's possible to actually do?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard of the book that you're referring to. What I can tell you is that President Obama has often made the argument that there's a difference between campaigning and governing. And I know that the incoming President made a lot of promises about all of the executive actions that he was going to repeal, but when he's responsible for governing the country, he will have to reconcile those promises with the impact -- the negative impact that following through on those promises would have on the country. That may end up altering his decision to follow through, but ultimately those will be decisions for him to make.\nAnd it's why you heard me on many occasions express a preference for working with Congress to try to institute policy that would be good for the country. But we ran into a brick wall of opposition when it comes to Republicans when they took power in 2011, and so we didn't pass as much legislatively as we would have liked to have done. But the President did use his executive authority to advance our country's interests and to advance the agenda that he was seeking to implement. And the incoming President will have to determine how much of that he wants to roll back.\nQ: And I've been dying to ask this all day -- all week, actually. Two former press secretaries to presidents have gone on to run for elective office after they left the podium up there, both unsuccessful. Would you ever consider relocating to your home state, the \"Show Me\" state of Missouri, where they do need some fresh Democrats -- I don't think you'll argue about it -- (laughter) -- and run for office yourself?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that I know that there are a lot of talented young Missourians who are Democrats who should not be overlooked. And I've certainly been in touch with some of them, and I think there's a bright future for Democrats in Missouri, but at this point I'm not planning to be one of them.\nJared.\nQ: Josh, over the weekend the President-elect told the Washington Post that he is supporting insurance for everybody, health insurance for everybody. Is this a plan that the President -- said he'll support something that's better than Obamacare? Is that enough to whet his appetite? Or does he need more information?\nMR. EARNEST: Jared, the President -- I can tell you that President Obama looks forward to somebody calling his bluff. The President spoke on live, national television, in primetime, looked directly into the camera and said that he will advocate for policy, even if it's put forward by Republicans, if it will cover more people and more effectively lower costs than even Obamacare has.\nSo the President stands by that promise. And according to what the President-elect promised to The Washington Post, it sounds like we might get a chance to see whether or not he's calling that bluff. The best way to cover everybody, and I think the only way that anybody thinks you can cover everybody, is through a single-payer plan.\nSo it's unclear, I think, exactly at this point exactly what the incoming administration's plans are. It does not appear that, according to some reporting that I saw, that even their nominee to be HHS secretary is clear exactly what their plans are.\nBut the President made that commitment, and he'll stand by it. And I assure you that there are few things that would make him happier in his post-presidency than to have the incoming administration call his bluff, because this is an issue that he feels strongly about. And as he himself has said, there's no pride of authorship here. If there are improvements that can be made on Obamacare, he won't hesitate to support them.\nQ: And I know that you haven't given us information about the frequency or duration or readouts of the calls between the President and the President-elect, but I want to ask, looking forward, once he's on vacation after Inauguration Day, then-former President Obama, what's the level of his unpluggedness, and will he be available if there's a call from the Commander-in-Chief?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is certainly true of former presidents is they have a unique perspective on the burden and challenges that are assumed by the incoming President. And as President Obama said the day after the election, he's rooting for the incoming President to succeed in uniting the country. And if there's an opportunity for former-President Obama to assist in that effort, I'm confident that wherever he is, he'll take the call.\nLalit.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I join in thanking you on behalf of the foreign press for working with us.\nMR. EARNEST: You're welcome.\nQ: And in fact, the first foreign pool was done when the President invited Indian Prime Minister in November of 2009, and since then we are having (inaudible). In the first briefing that the President -- the press secretary did in 2009, the main foreign policy topic was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. (Inaudible) was not. But my question is, there are still 10,000 troops left in Afghanistan. Does the President regret that he hasn't recalled all the troops from there? And had the situation been different, had Pakistan been more helpful in eliminating terrorist safe havens from their territories?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with regard to Pakistan, obviously, the United States has an extraordinarily complicated relationship, particularly when it comes to national security, with Pakistan. There are some areas where the United States and Pakistan have been able to effectively cooperate to counter terrorism and to fight extremism, and that's served the interests of both countries. And obviously, tragically, Pakistan is a country where many victims of terrorism have been claimed.\nAnd the President certainly is interested and is hopeful that the next administration will be able to deepen that cooperation with Pakistan, because it wouldn't just enhance security in Pakistan; it actually would make the United States safer, too.\nWith regard to Afghanistan, I think this will be the kind of issue that historians spend a lot of time looking at when evaluating President Obama's presidency. What President Obama promised to do when taking office was to refocus our attention on the threat from al Qaeda that emanates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. And President Obama put in place a strategy, working closely with his national security team, at the State Department and the intelligence community, and, of course, the Department of Defense. And over the course of several years, in part relying on some new capabilities, succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda that previously menaced the United States from hideouts in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\nThat is a major accomplishment, and it's an accomplishment that has made the American people safer. But the threat in that region of the world has not been eliminated, and there continue to be a smaller number of U.S. servicemembers keeping us safe, engaging in counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan.\nThey're also working closely with thousands of troops from our NATO partners who are also there doing the same thing. And I know there has been a question raised about how important a role NATO has played when it comes to counterterrorism. You have to look no further than Afghanistan to assess just how valuable a contribution that they have made to that effort.\nSo the situation in Afghanistan continues to be one of concern, and I think the President would acknowledge that this is an area where we've made important progress that has made the American people safer, but there's still important work to be done in this region of the world, and this is a responsibility that the incoming President will assume.\nQ: And the President visited India twice; no other President had in the past. And he has met with Prime Minister Modi both times. What kind of relationship the President would like the new administration to have with the largest democratic country in the world?\nMR. EARNEST: President Obama did make strengthening our ties with India a genuine priority. The President believed that that served our economic interest and our national security interest, and that would certainly explain the frequent visits of both Indian Prime Ministers during President Obama's tenure in office to the White House, and it would explain President Obama's visits to India as well. And each of those visits was oriented around a discussion about how to deepen our economic ties in a way that has positive benefits for workers in both our countries, but also to look for ways that we can work more effectively together to fight extremism and to enhance the security of citizens in both our countries.\nAnd President Obama certainly believes that we have made important progress in deepening and strengthening the relationship between two of the world's largest democracies, and is hopeful that that progress will continue under the next administration.\nFrancesca, I'm going to give my Kansas City girl the last one. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you. I truthfully was going to ask first, what the heck happened with the Chiefs the other night? (Laughter.) I'd like to know the answer to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Unfortunately, it's just the latest in a long string of heartbreaking playoff defeats for the Kansas City Chiefs. So there's always next year.\nQ: While endeavoring to keep it light here at the end, I apologize if you said some of this earlier, there was a little bit of a commotion at the beginning of the briefing --\nMR. EARNEST: There was.\nQ: Did you say how long the President and First Lady will be staying in Palm Beach? Is this like a quick trip or --\nMR. EARNEST: Palm Springs.\nQ: Sorry, sorry, Palm Springs. Gosh, not Palm Beach -- that's the other President. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I did not say how long they're going to stay. They will arrive on Friday afternoon in Palm Springs, but I don't anticipate having any updates on their travel schedule beyond then.\nQ: And you said the First Family -- so the daughters will also be going on that trip as well?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding. And we'll confirm that for you on Friday.\nQ: Is there a possibility that perhaps, immediately after that, they'll go back to Chicago? When they were there the other day, they didn't stay overnight -- hadn't visited the home. Is that potential in the docket? Trying to get one last week ahead here out of you. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. I guess this is one of the benefits of ending the presidency on a Friday, is I don't anticipate that there will be any more weeks-ahead. The President and the First Lady and their family are looking forward to getting out to Palm Springs and beginning to relax a little bit, but I don't have any updates on their plans beyond that.\nQ: And then one final question. We always assumed that the book the President was writing was a memoir. Is it possible that he's writing the next great American novel?\nMR. EARNEST: If he is, he has not told me that, but I think for a variety of reasons we're all eagerly anticipating how President Obama chooses to devote his time after leaving the White House.\nSo, thank you all. It's been a genuine pleasure. (Applause.)\n2:15 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Bush picked Dr. Louis Sullivan as the 17th HHS secretary in 1989 have we had such a uniquely qualified individual and healthcare professional to lead this huge and tremendously important department of our federal government.\nRunning an agency the size and scope of HHS requires many things: a strong understanding and appreciation of the nation's healthcare system, knowledge of the myriad other issues and agencies under the HHS umbrella, strong leadership and management skills, deep intellect, a capacity for learning and listening, creative problem-solving, and a willingness to try new things.\nPrice brings all of these characteristics to the job and certainly his well-recognized work ethic, knowledge of both policy and process, and commitment to improving the nation's healthcare system are some of the principal reasons Trump tapped him to fill this crucial Cabinet position.\n...\nPrice has always led by example and being action- and solution-oriented, puts policy proposals forward. For example, during the healthcare reform debate in 2010, he introduced the Empowering Patients First Act. His legislation was intended to serve as a Republican alternative to the Democrats' bill, but it eventually was positioned as a potential replacement of the enacted Affordable Care Act.\n...\nThe secretary of HHS needs to be someone thoughtful, knowledgeable, respected, trusted and able to solve problems. Price exceeds these job requirements.\nI hope the Senate quickly confirms him as secretary so the nation can begin to see what his patients, constituents and congressional colleagues all know: that he is a compassionate, competent and smart man who will help steer the nation's largest healthcare agency through a period of change with a steady hand on the rudder.", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: The Hill: Nominee Tom Price is the Doctor HHS Needs"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=49672", "text": "Today, nominee for United States Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin received a letter of support from Faith Schwartz, the former Executive Director of HOPE NOW, an organization dedicated to working with a broad sector of stakeholders committed to addressing challenges in the mortgage market and helping homeowners avoid foreclosure. Ms. Schwartz, who wrote a letter to Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Orrin Hatch and Ranking Member Ron Wyden, cited federal data showing that OneWest Bank, under Mr. Mnuchin's leadership, helped tens of thousands of borrowers stay in their homes by offering principal forgiveness and other forms of loan modifications.\n\"I am immensely grateful for the support of Faith Schwartz, a leading voice for homeowners during the housing crisis,\" said Steven Mnuchin. \"If confirmed, I look forward to listening to the concerns of the American people and working to make sure families never face another crisis like they did in 2008.\"\nFull text of the letter can be read below:\nDear Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden:\nI write in connection with the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury. I do not know Mr. Mnuchin, but as the former executive director of the HOPE NOW Alliance, I am intimately familiar with the loan modification and home retention programs of OneWest Bank, which have played such a prominent role in the media coverage of Mr. Mnuchin's nomination. I therefore wanted to make sure that the Committee has accurate facts as it considers this important nomination.\nHOPE NOW is a voluntary alliance between counselors, mortgage companies, investors, regulators, and other mortgage market participants created in 2007 with the strong encouragement of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HOPE NOW brought together diverse stakeholders to collaborate to address challenges in mortgage servicing and to assist at-risk homeowners. Since 2007, HOPE NOW has played an important role in facilitating more than six million loan modifications and other foreclosure avoidance solutions for homeowners. I was proud to lead the organization from its inception during the financial crisis through early 2013.\nAlthough the government encouraged the creation of HOPE NOW, membership is purely voluntary and not all banks and mortgage companies joined the alliance. Under Mr. Mnuchin's leadership, however, OneWest Bank joined early and took an active and leading role in rolling out homeowner assistance programs to its borrowers. In fact, OneWest was an early adopter of numerous voluntary loan modification programs, reflecting both the company's cultural commitment to home retention and Mr. Mnuchin's personal commitment to the FDIC to vigorously pursue foreclosure avoidance options wherever possible. For example, OneWest was one of the first banks to adopt the Principal Reduction Alternative, an optional part of the federal HAMP program under which participating servicers reduced borrower principal (nonparticipating institutions only reduced borrower interest rates, which was found to be a less sustainable model for borrowers who loan balances exceeded their property value). OneWest also was an early adopter of the 2MP program, which allowed servicers to modify qualifying second mortgages. OneWest was not required to offer any of these benefits to borrowers, and not all servicers adopted these programs. But OneWest's loan retention staff, as well as leadership, were committed to avoiding foreclosures where possible and were tremendous industry partners. To me, OneWest's consistent adoption of new home retention innovations spoke volumes about the company's commitment in this important area.\nHome retention options for the industry were varied and lacked a strong, consistent structure until HOPE NOW members and investors began coordination on a national loan modification structure. These industry efforts were enhanced when the Government HAMP modification program was introduced to servicers and loan investors in 2009. As a reminder, a loan modification means there is a reduction in rate, or change in term, or reduction in principal balance of a loan. Introducing these at scale was challenging to the mortgage industry and the investor community. Yet both the volume and the quality of home retention options OneWest provided to its customers were highly regarded, both by me and my HOPE NOW colleagues and by the federal government offices overseeing servicer performance. Treasury Department reports on loan modifications show that OneWest offered more than 101,000 loan modifications to struggling homeowners. And when OneWest offered loan modifications, its offers included principal forgiveness as much as five times more often industry averages. Its loan modifications also stood out for sustainability: The rate at which its trial modifications were converted to permanent modifications was 91 percent, the highest rate in the industry.\nI should note that OneWest's work to help borrowers through the financial crisis was not limited to modifications but also focused on refinance solutions. OneWest was a major supporter of the Obama Administration's HARP refinancing program, which encouraged banks to refinance high-rate mortgages on properties with little or no equity into more sustainable, lower rate loans. It is my view that this is one of the most important refinance programs that has been offered in the country, preventing subsequent foreclosures and modifications. The GSEs, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and lender partners saved homeowners from default by supporting this innovative refinance program. In 2013, the last year before OneWest sold its mortgage business, the company originated more than $400 million in HARP refinance loans, including more than $70 million to minority borrowers. This last point is particularly relevant, since some media reports have suggested that the company failed to lend in minority communities based on data for the time period after OneWest exited the mortgage business.\nI was very proud to lead HOPE NOW through this very dark economic time. The industry and homeowners struggled with record level defaults and the systems and processes were initially not adequate to accommodate the widespread national problems in the housing market. In order to make progress, the approaches to minimizing foreclosure needed reengineering, partnering, and strong communications, to make sure all options were reviewed to help troubled homeowners avoid foreclosures, and OneWest was an important partner and supporter in this effort.\nDespite all efforts to mitigate foreclosures, OneWest, like all servicers, did foreclose on some borrowers. It is important to review the full picture of activity to understand the scope of the situation and the progress and failures through this time period. One West had far fewer foreclosures than solutions it offered to homeowners. The regrettable fact of the financial crisis is that, for a variety of reasons, some borrowers lacked the financial ability to make payments on their loan obligations on any reasonable terms. For these borrowers, the question is whether OneWest exhausted all home retention options before foreclosing, and it made material errors in the foreclosure process. The best evidence on this question comes from the government's report of the results of the Independent Foreclosure Review, which required the 14 largest mortgage banks to review all their post-crisis foreclosure for compliance errors. This report showed that OneWest made mistakes in the loan modification process less than one-half of one percent of the time. Per the report, it foreclosed on borrowers who were not liable for foreclosure only .001 percent of the time, and in that minuscule number of cases, it paid full restitution to the affected borrowers. Most every institution I worked with through the crisis put their heart and soul into helping homeowners. That often gets lost in the discussions. While even one avoidable foreclosure is too many, my experience working with financial institutions is that OneWest's compliance rate put it at or near the very top performance of servicers.\nLet me reiterate that I do not know Steven Mnuchin personally but I dealt with his management team from the top ranks through the day-to-day staff that worked directly with at-risk borrowers. They were very active with HOPE NOW and supportive of the many efforts underway to help borrowers in default. I have no political agenda in promoting his confirmation. But as the former head of the national organization dedicated to finding home retention solutions for struggling homeowners affected by the financial crisis, I believe the record should be clear about the actual record of OneWest in delivering solutions to many thousands of its customers during my tenure at HOPE NOW.\nVery truly yours,\nFaith Schwartz\nFormer Executive Director\nHOPE NOW", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Release - Former HOPE NOW Director Issues Letter Supporting Mnuchin Treasury Nomination"}

Donald Trump's choice to run the Education Department has committed the unpardonable sin of devoting much of her fortune to helping poor kids escape failing public schools.\n...\nMrs. DeVos's most important qualification is that she has the courage of her convictions.\n...\nThe DeVoses have donated tens of millions of dollars to charity including a children's hospital in Michigan and an international art competition in Grand Rapids. They've also given to Christian organizations, which the left cites as evidence of concealed bigotry. Yet education has been their main philanthropic cause.\nDuring the 1990s, they patronized a private-school scholarship fund for low-income families and championed Michigan's first charter school law. In 2000 they helped bankroll a voucher initiative, which was defeated by a union blitz. The DeVoses then turned to expanding charters, which have become Exhibit A in the progressive campaign against her.\n...\nTwo studies from Stanford's Center for Research on Education Outcomes (2013, 2015) found that students attending Michigan charters gained on average an additional two months of learning every year over their traditional school counterparts. Charter school students in Detroit gained three months.\n...\nThe real reason unions fear Mrs. DeVos is that she's a rare reformer who has defeated them politically. Prior to being tapped by Mr. Trump, she chaired the American Federation for Children (AFC), which has helped elect hundreds of legislators across the country who support private school choice.\n...\nAFC has built a broad coalition that includes black and Latino Democrats, undercutting the union conceit that vouchers are a GOP plot to destroy public schools. In 2000 four states had private-school choice programs with 29,000 kids. Today, 25 states have vouchers, tax-credit scholarships or education-savings accounts benefitting more than 400,000 students.\n...\nYou know progressives have lost their moral bearings when they save their most ferocious assault for a woman who wants to provide poor children with the education they need to succeed in America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: WSJ: Who's Afraid of Betsy DeVos?"}

In his remarks, he referred to Natalie Wyeth Earnest, wife, and Walker Earnest, son, of Press Secretary Earnest.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122563", "text": "[The President joined the briefing in progress.]\nThe President. I'm not interrupting because he was saying nice things about you guys—[laughter]—because I largely concur.\nWhen I first met Josh Earnest, he was in Iowa. I think he was wearing jeans. He looked even younger than he was. And since my entire campaign depended on communications in Iowa, I gave him a pretty good once-over. And there are a couple things I learned about him right away. Number one, he's just got that all-American, matinee, good-looking thing going. [Laughter] That's helpful. Let's face it. Face made for television. [Laughter] Then, the guy's name is Josh Earnest—[laughter]—which, if somebody is speaking on your behalf, is a pretty good name to have. [Laughter]\nBut what struck me most, in addition to his smarts and his maturity and his actual interest in the issues, was his integrity. There are people you meet who you have a pretty good inkling right off the bat are straight shooters and were raised to be fundamentally honest and to treat people with respect. And there are times where that first impression turns out to be wrong, and you're a little disappointed. And you see behind the curtain that there's spin and some hype and posturing going on. But then, there's others who, the longer you know them, the better you know them, the more time you spend with them, the more you're tested under tough situations, the more that initial impression is confirmed.\nAnd I have now known this guy for 10 years, almost, and I've watched him grow, and I've watched him advance, and I've watched him marry, and I've watched him be a father, and I've watched him manage younger people coming up behind him. And he's never disappointed. He has always been the guy you wanted him to be.\nAnd I think that if you're the President of the United States and you find out that this is the guy who has been voted the most popular Press Secretary ever by the White House Press Corps, that may make you a little nervous—[laughter]—thinking, well, maybe the guy's, kind of, being too solicitous towards the press. But the fact is, is that he was worthy of that admiration.\nHe was tough, and he didn't always give you guys everything you wanted. But he was always prepared. He was always courteous. He always tried to make sure that he could share with you as much of our thinking and our policy and our vision as possible and tried to be as responsive as possible. And that's how he trained the rest of his team to be.\nSo, of the folks that I've had the great joy and pleasure of working with over the last 10 years on this incredible journey, this guy ranks as high as just about anybody I've worked with. He is not only a great Press Secretary, but more importantly, he is a really, really good man. And I'm really, really proud of him.\nSo, Josh, congratulations.\nPress Secretary Earnest. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. And, Natalie and Walker, thanks for putting up with all of this, because they've made sacrifices too.\nPress Secretary Earnest. Thank you, sir.\nPresident Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia\nQ. Mr. President, before you go—a response to Vladimir Putin?\nThe President. I'm going to be here tomorrow. [Laughter]\nQ. Where are you going on Friday?

Instead of resigning ourselves to ceaseless wars, we built institutions and alliances to advance our shared security.\nInstead of punishing former enemies, we invested billions in helping them rebuild.\nInstead of sorting the world into winners and losers, we outlined universal values that defined a better future for all our children.\nOur careful attention to building and sustaining a liberal international order—with the United States and Europe at its core—was the bedrock of the success the world enjoyed in the second half of the 20th Century.\nAn era of expanding liberty.\nUnprecedented economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.\nA community of democracies that—to this day—serves as the fulcrum for our common security and for our capacity to address the world's most pressing challenges.\nStrengthening these values—values that have served our community of nations so well, for so long—is paramount to retaining the position of leadership Western nations enjoy and preserving the progress we have made together.\nBut in recent years, it has become evident that the consensus upholding this system is facing incredible and increasing pressures—from both within and without.\nToday, I'd like to speak to the sources of those pressures, and about why it is imperative that we act urgently to defend the liberal international order.\nHere in this exclusive Alpine tower, where CEOs of multinational corporations rub elbows with leaders of nations, it is easy to embrace the intellectual benefits of a more open and integrated world.\nBut it is at our own peril that we ignore or dismiss the legitimate fears and anxieties that exist in communities all across the developed world.\nThe concern mothers and fathers feel about losing the factory job that has always allowed them to provide for their families.\nParents who don't believe that they can give their children a better life than the one they have.\nThese are the pressures that are undermining support for the liberal international order from the inside.\nGlobalization has not been an unalloyed good.\nIt has deepened the rift between those racing ahead at the top and those struggling to hang on in the middle, or falling to the bottom.\nOne year ago, I spoke here in Davos about the challenges we face in mastering this fourth industrial revolution—about how we can ensure that the benefits and the burdens of globalization and digitization are shared more equitably.\nIn my country, there used to be a basic bargain, embraced by both major political parties. It was something everyone agreed on.\nIf you contributed to the success of the enterprise, you shared in the profits. Today that bargain is fractured.\nAdvanced technology has divorced productivity from labor—meaning we're making more than ever, but with fewer workers.\nThere's a shrinking demand for low-skill laborers, while highly-educated workers are getting paid more and more—contributing to rising inequality.\nInternational trade and greater economic integration has lifted millions of people in the developing world out of abject poverty—improving education, extending life expectancies, opening new opportunities.\nStandards of living are still well below middle class expectations in the United States and Europe, but the change is real.\nMeanwhile, for many communities in the developed world that have long depended on manufacturing, the opposite is true.\nTheir relative standard of living has declined. They feel shut out of opportunities. And their economic security feels jeopardized.\nTaken together, these forces are effectively hollowing out the middle class—the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in Western nations.\nWe cannot undo the changes technology has wrought in our world—nor should we try.\nBut we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people's basic sense of dignity.\nOur goal should be a world where everyone's standard of living can rise together.\nThere's an urgency to taking common sense steps like: increasing cognitive capabilities through access to education and job training. Ensuring basic protections for workers. Expanding access to capital. And implementing a progressive, equitable tax system where everyone pays their fair share.\n[Pause]\nCompounding these economic worries are people's fears about the very real security risks we face.\nIf you look at the long sweep of history, or even just the trend lines in wars and other incidents of large-scale violence over the past 50, 60, 70 years—as a practical matter, we are probably safer than ever.\nBut it doesn't feel that way.\nDaily images of violence and unrest from all over the world are shared directly on our televisions and smart phones—images we rarely would have seen in a pre-digital age.\nIt's fostered a feeling of perpetual chaos—of being overrun by outside forces.\nCommunication technologies have fostered incredible progress—making information more open and accessible, breaking down the barriers between people and nations, facilitating greater scientific collaboration, empowering ordinary citizens to challenge injustice and hold their governments accountable.\nBut they have also given hateful individuals a megaphone to spread their virulent, extremist ideologies.\nRadical jihadists not only recruit and find haven in the ungoverned desserts of Iraq and Syria—they do the same in the ungoverned spaces of the Internet.\nBorders seem less real. Terrorist attacks feel inescapable. Fears about unrelenting migration mount as people continue to flee violence and deprivation in their homelands.\nAnd in the wake of these understandable fears, we have seen a series of alarming responses.\nPopular movements on both the left and the right have demonstrated a dangerous willingness to revert to political small-mindedness—to the same nationalist, protectionist, and isolationist agendas that led the world to consume itself in war during in the last century.\nAs we have seen time and again throughout history, demagogues and autocrats have emerged—seeking to capitalize on people's insecurities.\nIn this case, using Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, or xenophobic rhetoric to stoke fear, sow division, and advance their own narrow agendas.\nThis is a politics at odds with our values and with the vision that built—and sustains—the liberal international order.\nThe impulse to hunker down, shut the gates, build walls, and exit at this moment is precisely the wrong answer.\nIt offers a false sense of security in an interconnected world.\nIt will not resolve the root causes of these fears—and it risks eroding from the inside out the foundations of the very system that spawned the West's historically unprecedented success.\nWe need to tap into the—big-heartedness that conceived a Marshall Plan, the foresight that planned a Bretton Woods, the audacity that proposed a United Nations.\nWe cannot rout fear with retrenchment. Rather, this is the moment to lead boldly and recommit ourselves to our common principles—which remain essential to my nation, and to liberal democracies the world over.\nOf course, there are those who do not share this vision for the world.\nThose who wish to dissolve the community of democracies and our supporting institutions in favor of a more parochial international order—where power rules and spheres of influence lock in divides among nations.\nWe hear these voices in the West—but the greatest threats on this front spring from the distinct illiberalism of external actors who equate their success with a fracturing of the liberal international order.\nWe see this in Asia and the Middle East—where China and Iran would clearly prefer a world in which they hold sway in their regions. But I will not mince words. This movement is principally led by Russia.\nUnder President Putin, Russia is working with every tool available to them to whittle away at the edges of the European project, test for fault lines among western nations, and return to a politics defined by spheres of influence.\nWe see it in their aggression against their neighbors. Sending so-called \"little green men\" across the border to stir violence and strains of separatism in Ukraine. Using energy as a weapon—cutting off gas supplies mid-winter, raising prices to manipulate nations to act in Russia's interests. Using corruption to empower oligarchs and coerce politicians.\nWe see it in their worldwide use of propaganda and false information campaigns: Injecting doubt and political agitation into democratic systems. Strengthening illiberal factions, on both the left and the right, that seek to roll back decades of progress from within our systems.\nWe even saw it in the cyber intrusions against political parties and individuals in the United States—which our intelligence community has determined with high confidence were specifically motivated to influence our elections.\nBut it's not only the United States that has been targeted. Europe has seen the same kind of attacks in the past.\nAnd with many countries in Europe slated to hold elections this year, we should expect further attempts by Russia to meddle in the democratic process.\nAgain, their purpose is clear—to collapse the liberal international order. Simply put, Russia has a different vision for the future, which they are pursuing across the board.\nThey seek a return to a world where the strong impose their will through military might, corruption, or criminality—while weaker neighbors fall in line.\nAnd from the first moments of our Administration—even as we sought a reset with then-President Medvedev—President Obama and I have made it clear that this is no way for nations to behave in the 21st Century.\nWhen I addressed the Munich Security Conference in February of 2009, I said: \"We will not recognize any nation having a sphere of influence. It will remain our view that sovereign states have the right to make their own decisions and choose their own alliances.\"\nThat's been our position throughout the past eight years, and it is a position we must all continue championing in the years ahead.\nThe United States has not always been the perfect guardian of our order.\nWe have not always lived up to our own values—and some of our past missteps provided fodder for the forces of illiberalism.\nBut President Obama and I have worked consistently over the past eight years to lead not only by the example of our power—but by the power of our example.\nAnd this is the challenge that will—by necessity—define the foreign policy agendas of all our nations as we move forward.\nSo although I will only be the Vice President of the United States for 48 more hours—I am here today to issue a call to action.\nWe cannot wait for others to write the future they hope to see.\nThe United States and Europe must lead the fight to defend those values that have brought us to where we are today.\nFight to create more equitable and more inclusive growth for people at every level.\nFight for democracy wherever it is under threat—be it at home or abroad.\nFight to lift up the forces of inclusivity while opposing intolerance in all its guises.\nFight the urge to embrace isolationism and protectionism.\nFight back against the dangerous proposition that facts no longer matter.\nThat the truth holds no inherent power in a world where propagandists, demagogues, and extremists carry sway.\nTo win this fight, we must continue to invest in our democratic alliances.\nAs it as has been for seven decades, the unity of our transatlantic connection is essential to addressing global challenges.\nDefending the liberal international order requires that we resist the forces of European disintegration and maintain our long-standing insistence on a Europe whole, free and at peace.\nThat means fighting for the European Union—one of the most vibrant and consequential institutions on earth.\nThe EU has contributed to the prosperity of millions—fueling reforms that have improved living standards and driving the peaceful resolution of disputes between nations.\nThat means keeping open the door for membership in European and transatlantic institutions to those states on Europe's eastern edge—where people in places like the Balkans and Ukraine continue to strive to be part of the incredible undertaking that is the European Union.\nThe EU has been an indispensable partner to the United States—and as the EU and the UK begin to navigate a new relationship, it remains profoundly in America's interest to maintain our close relationships with both parties.\nAll of our peoples are safer when we work together.\nWe must continue to stand up for those basic norms of modern nations—the principles of territorial integrity, freedom of navigation, and national sovereignty.\nThe right of all nations \"to make their own decisions and choose their own alliances.\"\nTo that end—we must: bolster Europe's energy independence so that nations are not subject to outside manipulations; improve our cyber defenses; and combat misinformation to prevent outsiders from perverting our democratic processes.\nAnd the single greatest bulwark for our transatlantic partnership is the unshakable commitment of the United States to all our NATO Allies.\nAn attack on one is an attack on all. That can never be called into question. And we must continue to stand with Ukraine as they resist Russia's acts of aggression and pursue their European path.\nIn two days, the United States will engage in the act that has defined our exceptional democracy for more than 200 years—the peaceful transition of power from one leader, and one political party, to another.\nAnd it is my hope and expectation that the next President and Vice President, and our leaders in Congress, will ensure that the United States continues to fulfill our historic responsibility as the indispensable nation.\nBut we have never been able to lead alone—not after World War II, not during the depths of the Cold War, and not today.\nThe United States, our NATO allies, all the nations of Europe—we are in this together. As the oldest and the strongest democracies in the world, we have a responsibility to beat back the challenges at our door.\nWe must never forget how we got here. Or take for granted that our success will continue.\nIt is only by championing the liberal international order—by continuing to invest in our security, reaffirming our shared values, and expanding the cause of liberty around the world—that will retain our position of leadership.\nBecause if we don't fight for our values, no one else will.\nThe idea of Europe whole, free, and at peace—in my opinion—constitutes one of the most audacious and consequential visions of the past century.\nThe notion that after centuries of conflict, Europe could reinvent itself as an integrated community—one committed to political solidarity, the free flow of goods and people, and a solemn obligation to collective defense—and succeed in achieving it.\nThe United States believed in it. Peoples across Europe believed in it—aspired to it.\nAnd you did it.\nThe success of the European enterprise was essential to America's security in the 20th Century—and it remains so today.\nThe Atlantic Alliance is still the bedrock of addressing so many 21st Century threats—from terrorism to the spread of diseases like Ebola to climate change.\nYou've heard me make this case for four decades. But I am not alone in this belief. America's commitment to Europe and NATO is thoroughly bipartisan.\nJust last month, my good friend and frequent sparring partner, Republican Senator John McCain traveled to Estonia where he said: \"The best way to prevent Russian misbehavior [is] by having a credible, strong military and a strong NATO alliance.\"\nOn the same trip, another leading Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham, assured Ukrainian troops serving on the frontline: \"Your fight is our fight.\"\nThat's the same sentiment I expressed two days ago, when I made my sixth trip to Ukraine as Vice President.\nHistory has proven that the defense of free nations in Europe has always been America's fight—and the foundation of our security.\nThroughout more than four decades of incredibly divisive foreign policy debates, there has always been a consensus about the value of the transatlantic relationship.\nThat will not change.\nAnd as I re-enter private life, I want to assure you today that I will stand with you as you carry this fight forward.\nI will continue to use my voice and my power as a citizen—doing whatever I can to keep our transatlantic alliance strong and vibrant—because our common future depends upon it.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-18", "title": "Address by the Vice President to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=50785", "text": "(Washington, DC) – Today, nominee for Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt received the support of former Democratic Attorney General of Arkansas, Dustin McDaniel. Attorney General McDaniel cites the bipartisan effort put forth by Attorney General Pruitt to improve the water quality of the Illinois River watershed as a specific example for why he will be the perfect fit to promote President-elect Trump's environmental agenda, putting the American people and their environment first.\nThe Full Text of the Letter Can Be Read Below\nJanuary 18, 2017\nThe Honorable John Barrasso\nChairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works\n410 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nWashington, D.C. 20510\nThe Honorable Tom Carper\nRanking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works\n456 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nWashington, D.C. 20510\nRe: Attorney General Scott Pruitt's Nomination To Serve As Director of the Environmental Protection Agency\nDear Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and Members of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,\nMy name is Dustin McDaniel. I am an attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas. I served as the Democratic Attorney General of the State of Arkansas from 2007-2015. During that time, I served for three years as the Co-Chair of the Democratic Attorneys General Association. I am a member of the Democratic National Committee and was a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton's campaign for President. I am grateful for your work on this committee. I believe in the core mission of the Environmental Protection Agency. I believe that climate change is real and overwhelmingly the result of human activity. I believe that the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in shaping climate policy. These challenges in a hostile political environment will be acutely felt by the next director of the EPA.\nAs you consider the nomination of my friend Scott Pruitt, I respectfully ask that you enter this letter into the record so that I may attempt to clarify what I believe to be unfair criticisms of the historic agreement negotiated between myself on behalf of the State of Arkansas and Attorney General Pruitt on behalf of the State of Oklahoma regarding water quality in the Illinois River watershed.\nPrior to the elections of General Pruitt or myself, Oklahoma grappled with Arkansas municipal water systems and Arkansas industry, primarily poultry companies, over increased phosphorous levels in the Illinois River watershed. Pollution was substantially impacting the water quality in one of Oklahoma's most scenic waterways. In 2003, an agreement was executed between the states that would require that the phosphorus levels be reduced over the next 10 years to a level .037 parts per million. As a result, the states all parties in both sides of the state line worked diligently to substantially improve the water quality.\nAt the same time, then-Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson filed suit using an out of state plaintiffs firm against Arkansas's poultry industry. Many criticized the litigation as taking the focus away from the environment and placing it on money damages. The State of Oklahoma's outside counsel presented their case to U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frizzell. Almost all of the claims were dismissed by the court. The evidence was fully submitted to the judge in March of 2010 on the remaining question regarding injunctive relief. To this day, no ruling in that litigation has been handed down.\n2013, the ten-year deadline on the phosphorus level, was approaching, two things were evident: 1.) despite huge improvements in water quality, the bosporus level in the river would not be at .037 parts per million before the deadline, and 2.) research into the standard itself revealed that it was based on compromise positions rather than by hard science.\nThe States of Arkansas and Oklahoma were facing a point of litigating against one another (again) over this issue to the detriment of all concerned. I approached General Pruitt to ask if we could reach a solution that would protect the environment and demonstrate to our citizens that we were committed to working together on their behalf rather than litigating against one another using taxpayer dollars for lawyers instead of scientists.\nThe resulting agreement reflects that Oklahoma enhanced, not relaxed, its enforcement of environmental protection. Scientists were appointed to establish the proper water quality metrics, and at no time were the phosphorous abatement measures relaxed. It was an historic moment that demonstrated that cooperation in pursuit of environmental protection yielded better results than litigation. The resulting report was recently released from the commission and is available for your review.\nRecent press accounts regarding these efforts unfairly miss characterize the work that was done by General Pruitt and his team. He was a staunch defender of sound science and good policy as the appropriate tools to protect the environment of his state. I saw firsthand how General Pruitt was able to bridge political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as both positive and historic.\nAs I am sure that this committee will have questions about this matter, I wanted to take this opportunity to add facts and context to an accomplishment that should stand as a credit to General Pruitt's career and qualifications for this nomination.\nI sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit this letter to you and to your committee and to be a part of the record in these proceedings. I thank you for your service to our nation.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDustin McDaniel", "timestamp": "2017-01-18", "title": "Press Release - Former Democratic Attorney General Endorses Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency"}

Good afternoon, everybody. Let me start out by saying that I was sorely tempted to wear a tan suit today—[laughter]—for my last press conference. But Michelle, whose fashion sense is a little better than mine, tells me that's not appropriate in January. [Laughter]\nI covered a lot of the ground that I would want to cover in my Farewell Address last week. So I'm just going to say a couple of quick things before I start taking questions.\nFirst, we have been in touch with the Bush family today, after hearing about President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush being admitted to the hospital this morning. They have not only dedicated their lives to this country, they have been a constant source of friendship and support and good counsel for Michelle and me over the years. They are as fine a couple as we know. And so we want to send our prayers and our love to them. Really good people.\nSecond thing I want to do is to thank all of you. Some of you have been covering me for a long time; I see folks like Christi and Lynn. Some of you I've just gotten to know. We have traveled the world together. We've hit a few singles, a few doubles together. I've offered advice that I thought was pretty sound like, \"Don't do stupid stuff.\" [Laughter] And even when you complained about my long answers, I just want you to know that the only reason they were long was because you asked six-part questions. [Laughter]\nBut I have enjoyed working with all of you. That does not, of course, mean that I've enjoyed every story that you have filed. But that's the point of this relationship. You're not supposed to be sycophants, you're supposed to be skeptics. You're supposed to ask me tough questions. You're not supposed to be complimentary, but you're supposed to cast a critical eye on folks who hold enormous power and make sure that we are accountable to the people who sent us here.\nAnd you have done that. And you've done it, for the most part, in ways that I could appreciate for fairness even if I didn't always agree with your conclusions. And having you in this building has made this place work better. It keeps us honest. It makes us work harder. You have—it made us think about how we are doing what we do and whether or not we're able to deliver on what's been requested by our constituents.\nAnd for example, every time you've asked, \"Why haven't you cured Ebola yet?\" or \"Why is there that—still that hole in the Gulf?\" it has given me the ability to go back to my team and say, \"Will you get this solved before the next press conference?\" [Laughter]\nNow, I spent a lot of time on my—in my Farewell Address talking about the state of our democracy. It goes without saying that essential to that is a free press. That is part of how this place, this country, this grand experiment in self-government has to work. It doesn't work if we don't have a well-informed citizenry. And you are the conduit through which they receive the information about what's taking place in the halls of power.\nSo America needs you, and our democracy needs you. We need you to establish a baseline of facts and evidence that we can use as a starting point for the kind of reasoned and informed debates that ultimately lead to progress. And so my hope is, is that you will continue with the same tenacity that you showed us to do the hard work of getting to the bottom of stories and getting them right and to push those of us in power to be the best version of ourselves and to push this country to be the best version of itself.\nI have no doubt that you will do so. I'm looking forward to being an active consumer of your work rather than always the subject of it. I want to thank you all for your extraordinary service to our democracy.\nAnd with that, I will take some questions. And I will start with Jeff Mason, whose term apparently is not up. [Laughter] I thought we'd be going out together, brother, but you got to hang around for a while. [Laughter]\nQ. No, I'm staying put.\nThe President. Jeff Mason, Reuters.\nFormer U.S. Army Intelligence Analyst Chelsea E. Manning/Leaking of Classified Information/WikiLeaks Founder Julian P. Assange/Cybersecurity\nQ. Thank you, sir. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence will send a message that leaking classified material will not generate a tough sentence to groups like WikiLeaks? How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here?\nThe President. Well, first of all, let's be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.\nIt has been my view that given she went to trial, that due process was carried out, that she took responsibility for her crime, that the sentence that she received was very disproportional—disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received, and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made it sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.\nAnd I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of Government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that had been put in place.\nI recognize that there's some folks who think they're not enough, and I think all of us, when we're working in big institutions, may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we're often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk or the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or Embassies to function effectively. And that has to be kept in mind.\nSo with respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. First of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC e-mails that were leaked. I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance. And I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.\nWhat I can say broadly is that, in this new cyber age, we're going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us, whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes or trying to commit acts of terrorism or folks who want to interfere with our elections.\nAnd we're going to have to continually build the kind of architecture that makes sure our—the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we're doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their Government is doing on their behalf.\nBut with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have for the other commutations and pardons that I've done, and I felt that in light of all the circumstances that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.\nMargaret Brennan [CBS News].\nQ. Mr. President.\nThe President. There you are.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Ukraine/Nuclear Nonproliferation/Human Rights\nQ. Thank you. The President-elect has said that he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia if they substantially reduced their nuclear stockpile. Given your own efforts at arms control, do you think that's an effective strategy? Knowing this office and Mr. Trump, how would you advise his advisers to help him be effective when he deals with Vladimir Putin? And given your actions recently on Russia, do you think those sanctions should be viewed as leverage?\nThe President. Well, a couple of things. Number one, I think it is in America's interests and the world's interests that we have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my Presidency. Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community and tried to work with the President and the Government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways.\nI think it's fair to say that after President Putin came back into the Presidency that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seemed to be premised on the idea that whatever America is trying to do must be bad for Russia and so we want to try and counteract whatever they do, that return to an adversarial spirit that, I think, existed during the cold war has made the relationship more difficult. And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine.\nThe reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues. It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon, by force, by Russia. That wasn't our judgment, that was the judgment of the entire international community. And Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international law and international norms.\nWhat I've said to the Russians is, as soon as you stop doing that, the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve not only American interests, but also the interests of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don't confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.\nOn nuclear issues, in my first term, we negotiated the START II Treaty, and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stockpiles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further. I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there is—remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce our stockpiles. And part of the reason we've been successful on our nonproliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda is because we were leading by example.\nI hope that continues. But I think it's important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big countries don't go around and invade and bully smaller countries. I've said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are, historically, bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. But Ukraine is an independent country.\nAnd this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around the world in preserving basic norms and values, whether it's advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women's rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press.\nThe United States has not always been perfect in this regard. There are times where we, by necessity, are dealing with allies or friends or partners who, themselves, are not meeting the standards that we would like to see met when it comes to international rules and norms. But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting—in the United Nations, in the G-20, in the G-7—the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues. And it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues, because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.\nKevin Corke [Fox News].\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You have been a strong supporter of the idea of a peaceful transfer of power, demonstrated not terribly far from here, out in the Rose Garden. And yet, even as you and I speak, there are more than five dozen Democrats that are going to boycott the Inauguration of the incoming President. Do you support that? And what message would you send to Democrats to better demonstrate the peaceful transfer of power?\nAnd if I could follow, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with the President-elect previously. And without getting into too much of the personal side of it, I'm just curious, were you able to use that opportunity to convince him to take a fresh look at some of the important ideas that you will leave this office with: maintaining some semblance of the Affordable Care Act, some idea of keeping DREAMers here in the country without fear of deportation. Were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him? And how successful were you?\nThe President. Well, I won't go into details of my conversations with President-elect Trump. As I've said before, they are cordial. At times, they've been fairly lengthy, and they've been substantive. I can't tell you how convincing I've been. I think you'd have to ask him whether I've been convincing or not.\nI have offered my best advice, counsel about certain issues both foreign and domestic. And my working assumption is, is that having won an election opposed to a number of my initiatives and certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs to go, it is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values. And I don't expect that there's going to be enormous overlap.\nIt may be that on certain issues, once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to, in fact, provide health care for everybody—something he says he wants to do—or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here.\nBut I don't think we'll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk. And I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by his advisers, the people around him, which is why it's important to pay attention to these confirmation hearings.\nI can tell you that—and this is something I have told him—that this is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team: your Cabinet, your senior White House staff, all the way to fairly junior folks in their twenties and thirties, but who are executing on significant responsibilities.\nAnd so how you put a team together to make sure that they're getting you the best information and they are teeing up the options from which you will ultimately make decisions, that's probably the most useful advice, the most constructive advice that I've been able to give him. That if you find yourself isolated because the process breaks down, or if you're only hearing from people who agree with you on everything, or if you haven't created a process that is fact-checking and probing and asking hard questions about policies or promises that you've made, that's when you start making mistakes. And as I indicated in some of my previous remarks, reality has a way of biting back if you're not paying attention to it.\nWith respect to the Inauguration, I'm not going to comment on those issues. All I know is I'm going to be there. [Laughter] So is Michelle. And I have been checking the weather, and I'm heartened by the fact that it won't be as cold as my first Inauguration—[laughter]—because that was cold.\nJanet Rodriguez [Univision].\nThe President's Post-Presidency Plans/Immigration/Cuba-U.S. Relations\nQ. Right here, Mr. President. Thank you very much. You have said that you would come back to fight for the DREAMers. You said that a couple of weeks ago. Are you fearful for the status of those DREAMers, the future of the young immigrants and all immigrants in this country, with the new administration? And what did you mean when you said you would come back? Would you lobby Congress? Maybe explore the political arena again? And if I may ask you a second question, why did you take action on \"dry foot, wet foot\" a week ago? The President. Well, let me be absolutely clear. I did not mean that I was going to be running for anything anytime soon. [Laughter] So no, what I meant is that it's important for me to take some time to process this amazing experience that we've gone through; to make sure that my wife, with whom I will be celebrating a 25th anniversary this year, is willing to re-up and put up with me for a little bit longer. I want to do some writing. I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much. I want to spend precious time with my girls.\nSo those are my priorities this year. But as I said before, I'm still a citizen. And I think it is important for Democrats or progressives who feel that they came out on the wrong side of this election to be able to distinguish between the normal back and forth, ebb and flow of policy: Are we going to raise taxes or are we going to lower taxes? Are we going to expand this program or eliminate this program? How concerned are we about air pollution or climate change? Those are all normal parts of the debate. And as I've said before, in a democracy, sometimes, you're going to win on those issues and sometimes you're going to lose.\nI'm confident about the rightness of my positions on a lot of these points, but we've got a new President and a Congress that are going to make their same determinations. And there will be a back and forth in Congress around those issues, and you guys will report on all that.\nBut there's a difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake. I put in that category if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion. I put in that category, explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise. I'd put in that category, institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press.\nAnd for me, at least, I would put in that category, efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else when they love this country, they are our kids' friends and our—their classmates and are now entering into community colleges or, in some cases, serving in our military. That—the notion that we would just arbitrarily or because of politics, punish those kids when they didn't do anything wrong themselves, I think, would be something that would merit me speaking out. It doesn't mean that I would get on the ballot anywhere.\nWith respect to \"wet foot, dry foot,\" we underwent a monumental shift in our policy towards Cuba. My view was, after 50 years of a policy not working, it made sense for us to try to reopen diplomatic relations, to engage a Cuban Government, to be honest with them about the strong disagreements we have around political repression and treatment of dissenters and freedom of press and freedom of religion, but that to make progress for the Cuban people, our best shot was to suddenly have the Cuban people interacting with Americans and seeing the incredible success of the Cuban American community and engaging in commerce and business and trade, and that it was through that process of opening up these bilateral relations that you would see over time serious and significant improvement.\nGiven that shift in the relationship, the policy that we had in place was \"wet foot, dry foot,\" which treated Cuban emigres completely different from folks from El Salvador or Guatemala or Nicaragua or any other part of the world, one that made a distinction between whether you got here by land or by foot, that was a carryover of a old way of thinking that didn't make sense in this day and age, particularly as we're opening up travel between the two countries.\nAnd so we had very lengthy consultations with the Department of Homeland Security. We had some tough negotiations with the Cuban Government. But we arrived at a policy which we think is both fair and appropriate to the changing nature of the relationship between the two countries.\nNadia Bilbassy [Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, Al Arabiya].\nQ. Thank you, sir. I appreciate the opportunity, and I want to wish you and your family best of luck in the future.\nThe President. Thank you.\nArab-Israeli Peace Process\nQ. Mr. President, you have been criticized and even personally attacked for the U.N. Security Council resolution that considered Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace. Mr. Trump promised to move the Embassy to Jerusalem. He appointed an Ambassador that doesn't believe in the two-state solution. How worried are you about the U.S. leadership in the Arab world and beyond as an honest broker? Will this ignite a third intifada? Will this even protect Israel? And in retrospect, do you think that you should have held Israel more accountable, like President Bush, Senior, did with the loan guarantees? Thank you.\nThe President. I am—I continue to be significantly worried about the Israeli-Palestinian issue. And I'm worried about it both because I think the status quo is unsustainable, that it is dangerous for Israel, that it is bad for Palestinians, it is bad for the region, and it is bad for America's national security.\nAnd I came into this office wanting to do everything I could to encourage serious peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. And we invested a lot of energy, a lot of time, a lot of effort, first year, second year, all the way until last year. Ultimately, what has always been clear is that we cannot force the parties to arrive at peace. What we can do is facilitate, provide a platform, encourage. But we can't force them to do it.\nBut in light of shifts in Israeli politics and Palestinian politics; a rightward drift in Israeli politics; a weakening of President Abbas's ability to move and take risks on behalf of peace in the Palestinian Territories; in light of all the dangers that have emerged in the region and the understandable fears that Israelis may have about the chaos and rise of groups like ISIL and the deterioration of Syria—in light of all those things, what we at least wanted to do, understanding that the two parties wouldn't actually arrive at a final status agreement, is to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, because we do not see an alternative to it.\nAnd I've said this directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu. I've said it inside of Israel. I've said it to Palestinians as well. I don't see how this issues gets resolved in a way that maintains Israel as both Jewish and a democracy, because if you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation. Functionally, you end up having one state in which millions of people are disenfranchised and operate as second-class occupants—or residents. You can't even call them citizens, necessarily.\nAnd so the goal of the resolution was to simply say that the settlements—the growth of the settlements— are creating a reality on the ground that increasingly will make a two-state solution impossible. And we believed, consistent with the position that had been taken with previous U.S. administrations for decades now, that it was important for us to send a signal, a wake-up call, that this moment may be passing, and Israeli voters and Palestinians need to understand that this moment may be passing. And hopefully, that then creates a debate inside both Israeli and Palestinian communities that won't result immediately in peace, but at least will lead to a more sober assessment of what the alternatives are. So the President-elect will have his own policy. The Ambassador—or the candidate for the Ambassadorship obviously has very different views than I do. That is their prerogative. That's part of what happens after elections. And I think my views are clear. We'll see how their approach plays itself out.\nI don't want to project today what could end up happening, but obviously, it's a volatile environment. What we've seen in the past is, when sudden, unilateral moves are made that speak to some of the core issues and sensitivities of either side, that can be explosive. And I—what we've tried to do in the transition is just to provide the context in which the President-elect may want to make some of these decisions.\nQ. Are you worried that this—[inaudible].\nThe President. Well, that's part of what we've tried to indicate to the incoming team in our transition process, is pay attention to this, because this is volatile stuff. People feel deeply and passionately about this. And as I've said, I think, many times, the actions that we take have enormous consequences and ramifications.\nWe're the biggest kid on the block. And I think it is right and appropriate for a new President to test old assumptions and reexamine the old ways of doing things. But if you're going to make big shifts in policy, just make sure you've thought it through, and understand that there are going to be consequences, and actions typically create reactions, and so you want to be intentional about it. You don't want to do things off the cuff when it comes to an issue this volatile.\nChris Johnson [Washington Blade]. Chris Johnson.\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights\nQ. On LGBT rights——\nThe President. I'm sorry, where is Chris?\nQ. I'm right here in the back, Mr. President.\nThe President. I'm sorry. I didn't see you.\nQ. On LGBT rights, we've seen a lot of achievements over the past 8 years, including signing hate crimes protection legislation, \"don't ask, don't tell\" repeal, marriage equality nationwide, and ensuring transgender people feel visible and accepted. How do you think LGBT rights will rank in terms of your accomplishments and your legacy? And how confident are you that progress will endure or continue under the President-elect?\nThe President. I could not be prouder of the transformation that's taken place in our society just in the last decade. And I've said before, I think we made some useful contributions to it, but the primary heroes in this stage of our growth as a democracy and a society are all the individual activists and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, \"This is who I am, and I'm proud of it.\"\nAnd that opened people's minds and opened their hearts. And eventually, laws caught up. But I don't think any of that would have happened without the activism, in some cases, loud and noisy, but in some cases, just quiet and very personal.\nAnd I think that what we did as an administration was to help to—the society to move in a better direction, but to do so in a way that didn't create an enormous backlash and was systematic and respectful of the fact that, in some cases, these issues were controversial. I think that the way we handled, for example, \"don't ask, don't tell\"—being methodical about it, working with the Joint Chiefs, making sure that we showed this would not have an impact on the effectiveness of the greatest military on Earth—and then to have Defense Secretary in Bob Gates and Chairman in Mike Mullen and a Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately worked with me to do the right thing, I am proud of that. But again, none of that would have happened without this incredible transformation that was happening in society out there.\nYou know, when I gave Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant what I said. I think somebody that kind and likeable projecting into living rooms around the country, that changed attitudes. And that wasn't easy to do for her. And that's just one small example of what was happening in countless communities all across the country.\nSo I'm proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance.\nI don't think it is something that will be reversible because American society has changed; the attitudes of young people, in particular, have changed. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be some fights that are important—legal issues, issues surrounding transgender persons—there are still going to be some battles that need to take place.\nBut if you talk to young people of Malia, Sasha's generation, even if they're Republicans, even if they're conservative, many of them would tell you, I don't understand how you would discriminate against somebody because of sexual orientation. That's just sort of burned into them in pretty powerful ways.\nApril Ryan [American Urban Radio Network].\nDiversity/U.S. Olympic Team/Economic Inequality/Voting Rights/Congressional Redistricting/Criminal Justice Reform/Campaign Finance Reform\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Long before today, you've been considered a rights President. Under your watch, people have said that you have expanded the rubberband of inclusion. And with the election and the incoming administration, people are saying that rubberband has recoiled and maybe is even broken. And I'm taking you back to a time on Air Force One going to Selma, Alabama, when you said your job was to close the gaps that remain. And with that, what gaps still remain when it comes to rights issues on the table? And also, what part will you play in fixing those gaps after—in your new life?\nAnd lastly, you are the first Black President. Do you expect this country will see this again?\nThe President. Well, I'll answer the last question first. I think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith, corner of this country, because that's America's strength. When we have everybody getting a chance and everybody is on the field, we end up being better.\nI think I've used this analogy before. We killed it in the Olympics in Brazil. And Michelle and I, we always have our—the Olympic team here. And it's a lot of fun, first of all, just because anytime you're meeting somebody who is the best at anything—[laughter]—it's impressive. And these mostly very young people are all just so healthy looking, and they just beam and exude fitness and health. And so we have a great time talking to them.\nBut they are of all shapes, sizes, colors: the genetic diversity that is on display is remarkable. And if you look at a Simone Biles, and then you look at a Michael Phelps, they're completely different. And it's precisely because of those differences that we've got people here who can excel at any sport.\nAnd by the way, more than half of our medals came from women. And the reason is, is because we had the foresight several decades ago, with something called Title IX, to make sure that women got opportunities in sports, which is why our women compete better, because they have more opportunities than folks in other countries.\nSo I use that as a metaphor. And if in fact we continue to keep opportunity open to everybody, then, yes, we're going to have a woman President, we're going to have a Latino President, and we'll have a Jewish President, a Hindu President. Who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed-up Presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them. [Laughter] And that's fine.\nNow, what do I worry about? I obviously spent a lot of time on this, April, at my Farewell Address on Tuesday, so I won't go through the whole list. I worry about inequality, because I think that if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast, and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans, and I—not just along racial lines. I mean, there are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the President-elect because they feel forgotten and disenfranchised. They feel as if they're being looked down on. They feel as if their kids aren't going to have the same opportunities as they did.\nAnd you don't want to have an America in which a handful—a very small sliver of people are doing really well and everybody else is fighting for scraps, as I said last week. Because that's oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified, because people think, well, the only way I'm going to get ahead is if I make sure somebody else gets less, somebody who doesn't look like me or doesn't worship at the same place I do. That's not a good recipe for our democracy.\nI worry about, as I said in response to a previous question, making sure that the basic machinery of our democracy works better. We are the only country in the advanced world that makes it harder to vote rather than easier. And that dates back; there's an ugly history to that that we should not be shy about talking about.\nQ. Voting rights?\nThe President. Yes, I'm talking about voting rights. The reason that we are the only country among advanced democracies that makes it harder to vote is—it traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery. And it became, sort of, acceptable to restrict the franchise. And that's not who we are. That shouldn't be who we are. That's not when America works best.\nSo I hope that people pay a lot of attention to making sure that everybody has a chance to vote. Make it easier, not harder. This whole notion of election—of voting fraud, this is something that has constantly been disproved. This is fake news. The notion that there are a whole bunch of people out there who are going out there and are not eligible to vote and want to vote. We have the opposite problem. We have a whole bunch of people who are eligible to vote who don't vote. And so the idea that we'd put in place a whole bunch of barriers to people voting doesn't make sense.\nAnd then the—as I've said before, political gerrymandering that makes your vote matter less because politicians have decided you live in a district where everybody votes the same way you do so that these aren't competitive races, and we get 90-percent Democratic districts, 90-percent Republican districts, that's bad for our democracy too. I worry about that. I think it is very important for us to make sure that our criminal justice system is fair and just. But I also think it's also very important to make sure that it is not politicized, that it maintains an integrity that is outside of partisan politics at every level.\nI think at some point we're going to have to spend—and this will require some action by the Supreme Court—we have to reexamine just the flood of endless money that goes into our politics, which I think is very unhealthy.\nSo there are a whole bunch of things I worry about there. And as I said in my speech on Tuesday, we've got more work to do on race. It is not—it is simply not true that things have gotten worse. They haven't. Things are getting better. And I have more confidence on racial issues in the next generation than I do in our generation or the previous generation. I think kids are smarter about it. They're more tolerant. They are more inclusive by instinct than we are. And hopefully, my Presidency maybe helped that along a little bit.\nBut you know, we—when we feel stress, when we feel pressure, when we're just fed information that encourages some of our worst instincts, we tend to fall back into some of the old racial fears and racial divisions and racial stereotypes. And it's very hard for us to break out of those and to listen and to think about people as people and to imagine being in that person's shoes.\nAnd by the way, it's no longer a Black and White issue alone. You got Hispanic folks, and you got Asian folks, and this is not just the same old battles. We've got this stew that's bubbling up of people from everywhere. And we're going to have to make sure that we, in our own lives, in our own families and workplaces, do a better job of treating everybody with basic respect and understanding that not everybody starts off in the same situation and imagining what would it be like if you were born in an inner city and had no job prospects anywhere within a 20-mile radius or how does it feel being born in some rural county where there's no job opportunities in a 20-mile radius—and seeing those two things as connected as opposed to separate.\nSo we've got work to do. But overall, I think on this front, the trend lines ultimately, I think, will be good.\nChristi Parsons [Chicago Tribune]. And Christi, you are going to get the last question.\nQ. Oh, no. [Laughter]\nThe President. Christi is—I've been knowing her since Springfield, Illinois. When I was a State senator, she listened to what I had to say. [Laughter] So the least I can do is give her the last question as President of the United States. Go ahead.\nQ. That 217 number still works, so—[laughter].\nThe President. There you go. Go ahead.\nQ. Well, thank you, Mr. President. It has been an honor.\nThe President. Thank you.\nThe President's Daughters/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. And I have a personal question for you, because I know how much you like those. The First Lady put the stakes of the 2016 election in very personal terms in a speech that resonated across the country, and she really spoke the concerns of a lot of women, LGBT folks, people of color, many others. And so I wonder now how you and the First Lady are talking to your daughters about the meaning of this election and how you interpret it for yourself and for them.\nThe President. You know, every parent brags on their daughters or their sons. If your mom and dad don't brag on you, you know, you've got problems. [Laughter] But, man, my daughters are something, and they just surprise and enchant and impress me more and more every single day as they grow up. And so these days, when we talk, we talk as parent to child, but also we learn from them.\nAnd I think it was really interesting to see how Malia and Sasha reacted. They were disappointed. They paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it because it's consistent with what we've tried to teach them in our household and what I've tried to model as a father with their mom and what we've asked them to expect from future boyfriends or spouses.\nBut what we've also tried to teach them is resilience, and we've tried to teach them hope, and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world. And so you get knocked down, you get up, brush yourself off, and you get back to work. And that tended to be their attitude.\nI think neither of them intend to pursue a future of politics, and in that too, I think their mother's influence shows. [Laughter] But both of them have grown up in an environment where I think they could not help but be patriotic, to love this country deeply, to see that it's flawed, but see that they have responsibilities to fix it. And that they need to be active citizens, and they have to be in a position to talk to their friends and their teachers and their future coworkers in ways that try to shed some light as opposed to just generate a lot of sound and fury.\nAnd I expect that's what they're going to do. They do not—they don't mope. And what I really am proud of them—but what makes me proudest about them is that they also don't get cynical about it. They have not assumed because their side didn't win or because some of the values that they care about don't seem as if they were vindicated, that automatically America has somehow rejected them or rejected their values or—I don't think they feel that way.\nI think that they have, in part through osmosis, in part through dinnertime conversations, appreciated the fact that this is a big, complicated country, and democracy is messy, and it doesn't always work exactly the way you might want, it doesn't guarantee certain outcomes. But if you're engaged and you're involved, then there are a lot more good people than bad in this country, and there's a core decency to this country, and that they've got to be a part of lifting that up.\nAnd I expect they will be. And in that sense, they are representative of this generation that makes me really optimistic.\nI've been asked—I've had some off-the-record conversations with some journalists where they said, okay, you seem like you're okay, but really, really, what are you thinking? [Laughter] And I've said, no, I—what I'm saying really is what I think. I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad. I believe tragic things happen—I think there's evil in the world—but I think that at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we're true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time. That's what this Presidency has tried to be about. And I see that in the young people I've worked with. I couldn't be prouder of them. And so this is not just a matter of \"No Drama Obama.\" [Laughter] This is what I really believe. It is true that behind closed doors I curse more than I do publicly. [Laughter] And sometimes, I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does. But at my core, I think we're going to be okay. We just have to fight for it. We have to work for it and not take it for granted. And I know that you will help us do that.\nThank you very much, press corps.

After a major financial crisis, it should not be surprising that some unfortunate individuals lost jobs, suffered other tragedies, and were not able to repay their mortgages on any terms; those foreclosures are human tragedies. But the real story here is how much better OneWest was at saving homes than most banks. Government reviews show that OneWest offered more than 100,000 loan modifications to delinquent borrowers, as well as that those loan modifications included more principal forgiveness than any similarly sized bank. Importantly, when foreclosure was the only option, OneWest made mistakes far less often than others in the industry.\" - Walter Mix, Former Commissioner of the California Department of Financial Institutions, Letter to the Senate Finance Committee, 1/12/16\n\"A 2011 audit by the FDIC Office of Inspector General found that OneWest properly administered these loan-modification requirements \"more than 98 percent of the time.\" The remaining 93% of the loans were owned by investors, tied up mostly in securitization trusts. For these, implementing similar loan-modification terms as those required by the FDIC would have required investors' consent….Ultimately, the facts around the IndyMac failure and sale are clear. IndyMac was felled by a toxic mix of bad underwriting, aggressive growth and high-cost funding, which made it a uniquely unappealing bank that was going to cost the FDIC a lot of money no matter who bought it. Simply put, it was sold to a buyer who was willing to pay more than any other after an open and fair competitive bidding process in a highly distressed market environment. This, in the end, lowered the FDIC's losses.\" - Jim Wigand, former deputy director of the FDIC's Division of Resolution and Receiverships and John Bovenzi, former deputy to the FDIC chairman former CEO of IndyMac during its conservatorship, Wall Street Journal, 1/18/17\n\"In the IndyMac transaction, to my knowledge, Mr. Mncuhin and the investors adhered to all aspects of the FDIC's requirements, persevered through months and months of anguish and negotiations, and did what even the FDIC had not expected. They invested $1.3 billion of their own cash to acquire the entire bank at the least cost to the government, earning the right to keep it open for business for the benefit of its customers, employees and new shareholders.\" - Thomas Vartanian, former General Counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and FSLIC, Letter to the Senate Finance Committee, 1/12/17", "timestamp": "2017-01-19", "title": "Press Release - Regulators Heap Praise on Mnuchin"}

Trump today announced his intention to nominate former Governor of Georgia Sonny Perdue as Secretary of Agriculture.\nAs the former governor of a state that produces billions in agricultural products each year, Sonny Perdue has embraced policies under which Georgia farmers have thrived, and he is ready to generate the same level of success on the national level. Having been raised on a farm and worked as a veterinarian, Perdue is deeply in touch with the concerns of American farmers and will fight for their prosperity.\n\"Sonny Perdue is going to accomplish great things as Secretary of Agriculture,\" said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \"From growing up on a farm to being governor of a big agriculture state, he has spent his whole life understanding and solving the challenges our farmers face, and he is going to deliver big results for all Americans who earn their living off the land.\"\n\"I am proud and honored to be joining President-elect Trump's administration as his Secretary of Agriculture,\" said Sonny Perdue. \"Beginning as a simple Georgia farm boy, making sure Americans who make their livelihood in the agriculture industry are thriving is near and dear to my heart, and I'm going to champion the concerns of American agriculture and work tirelessly to solve the issues facing our farm families in this new role.\"\nSonny Perdue was born in Perry, Georgia, to a lifelong farmer and a classroom teacher. He graduated from Warner Robins High School and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1971 from the University of Georgia. Following his service as a Captain in the United States Air Force, Perdue became a successful small business owner, concentrating in agribusiness and transportation. Today, those businesses have grown to include several locations across the Southeast. After serving on the Houston County, Georgia Planning and Zoning Board during the 1980's, he ran for the Georgia State Senate in 1990 and won. Sonny spent the next 11 years representing his Middle Georgia district in the General Assembly. Perdue left the State Senate in 2001 to begin his successful campaign for Governor, which focused on restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians. Sonny served as Governor from 2003-2011. He, and the former Mary Ruff of Atlanta, have been married for forty-four years. The couple has four children and fourteen grandchildren. Additionally, Sonny and Mary have served as foster parents for eight newborns awaiting adoption.", "timestamp": "2017-01-19", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

The Office of the Press Secretary released a report, \"Obama Administration Efforts To Close the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility,\" with this letter. An original was not available for verification of the content of the letter. APP NOTE: The report accompanying the White House press release is available  by clicking here .", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=6798", "text": "Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. President:)\nFor 15 years, the United States has detained hundreds of people at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, a facility that never should have been opened in the first place. Rather than keeping us safer, the detention facility at Guantanamo undermines American national security. Terrorists use it for propaganda, its operations drain our military resources during a time of budget cuts, and it harms our partnerships with allies and countries whose cooperation we need against today's evolving terrorist threat. By any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.\nAs President, I have tried to close Guantanamo. When I inherited this challenge, it was widely recognized that the facility—which many around the world continue to condemn—needed to close. Unfortunately, what had previously been bipartisan support for closure suddenly became a partisan issue. Despite those politics, we have made progress. This Administration established a comprehensive, interagency review process to assess whether the transfer of a detainee is in the national security interest of the United States. Under this rigorous process, we have transferred 196 detainees from Guantanamo with arrangements designed to keep them from engaging in acts that pose a threat to the United States and our allies. Of the nearly 800 detainees at one time held at the facility, today only 41 remain.\nThe Department of Defense has also provided the Congress with a comprehensive plan to finally close Guantanamo once and for all. In addition to calling for us to continue to identify and effectuate secure transfer opportunities, it calls for the continued periodic review of the threat posed by individuals still detained, the use of all legal tools to deal with the remaining detainees still held under law of war detention, and the identification of a secure location in the United States to hold remaining detainees who are subject to military commissions or who we have determined must continue to be detained because they pose a continuing significant threat to the United States. I have included an update to that plan here.\nThe restrictions imposed by the Congress that prevent us from imprisoning detainees—even to prosecute and secure a life sentence—in the United States make no sense. No person has ever escaped one of our super-max or military prisons here, ever. There is simply no justification beyond politics for the Congress' insistence on keeping the facility open. Members of Congress who obstruct efforts to close the facility, given the stakes involved for our security, have abdicated their responsibility to the American people. They have placed politics above the ongoing costs to taxpayers, our relationships with our allies, and the threat posed to U.S. national security by leaving open a facility that governments around the world condemn and which hinders rather than helps our fight against terrorism.\nIf this were easy, we would have closed Guantanamo years ago. But history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to bring it to a responsible end. Once again, I encourage the Congress to close the facility and permit more of our brave men and women in uniform serving at Guantanamo Bay to return to meeting the challenges of the 21st century around the globe. There remains bipartisan support for closing Guantanamo and we can do so in a responsible and secure way that also saves the American taxpayer money.

It's a letter meant to share what we know, what we've learned, and what small wisdom may help our successor bear the great responsibility that comes with the highest office in our land, and the leadership of the free world.\nBut before I leave my note for our 45th president, I wanted to say one final thank you for the honor of serving as your 44th. Because all that I've learned in my time in office, I've learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.\nThroughout these eight years, you have been the source of goodness, resilience, and hope from which I've pulled strength. I've seen neighbors and communities take care of each other during the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. I have mourned with grieving families searching for answers—and found grace in a Charleston church.\nI've taken heart from the hope of young graduates and our newest military officers. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch, and wounded warriors once given up for dead walk again. I've seen Americans whose lives have been saved because they finally have access to medical care, and families whose lives have been changed because their marriages are recognized as equal to our own. I've seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees, or work for peace, and, above all, to look out for each other.\nI've seen you, the American people, in all your decency, determination, good humor, and kindness. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I've seen our future unfolding.\nAll of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into that work—the joyous work of citizenship. Not just when there's an election, not just when our own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime.\nI'll be right there with you every step of the way.\nAnd when the arc of progress seems slow, remember: America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word \"We.\" \"We the People.\" \"We shall overcome.\"\nYes, we can.", "timestamp": "2017-01-19", "title": "Message to the Nation on Serving as President"}

In order to ensure that the President's appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations, I ask on behalf of the President that you immediately take the following steps:\n1. Subject to any exceptions the Director or Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (the \"OMB Director\") allows for emergency situations or other urgent circumstances relating to health, safety, financial, or national security matters, or otherwise, send no regulation to the Office of the Federal Register (the \"OFR\") until a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2017, reviews and approves the regulation. The department or agency head may delegate this power of review and approval to any other person so appointed or designated by the President, consistent with applicable law.\n2. With respect to regulations that have been sent to the OFR but not published in the Federal Register, immediately withdraw them from the OFR for review and approval as described in paragraph 1, subject to the exceptions described in paragraph 1. This withdrawal must be conducted consistent with OFR procedures.\n3. With respect to regulations that have been published in the OFR but have not taken effect, as permitted by applicable law, temporarily postpone their effective date for 60 days from the date of this memorandum, subject to the exceptions described in paragraph 1, for the purpose of reviewing questions of fact, law, and policy they raise. Where appropriate and as permitted by applicable law, you should consider proposing for notice and comment a rule to delay the effective date for regulations beyond that 60-day period. In cases where the effective date has been delayed in order to review questions of fact, law, or policy, you should consider potentially proposing further notice-and-comment rulemaking. Following the delay in effective date:\n(a) for those regulations that raise no substantial questions of law or policy, no further action needs to be taken; and(b) for those regulations that raise substantial questions of law or policy, agencies should notify the OMB Director and take further appropriate action in consultation with the OMB Director.\n4. Exclude from the actions requested in paragraphs 1 through 3 any regulations subject to statutory or judicial deadlines and identify such exclusions to the OMB Director as soon as possible.\n5. Notify the OMB Director promptly of any regulations that, in your view, should be excluded from the directives in paragraphs 1 through 3 because those regulations affect critical health, safety, financial, or national security matters, or for some other reason. The OMB Director will review any such notifications and determine whether such exclusion is appropriate under the circumstances.\n6. Continue in all circumstances to comply with any applicable Executive Orders concerning regulatory management.\nAs used in this memorandum, \"regulation\" has the meaning given to \"regulatory action\" in section 3(e) of Executive Order 12866, and also includes any \"guidance document\" as defined in section 3(g) thereof as it existed when Executive Order 13422 was in effect. That is, the requirements of this memorandum apply to \"any substantive action by an agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking,\" and also covers any agency statement of general applicability and future effect \"that sets forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue.\"\nThis regulatory review will be implemented by the OMB Director. Communications regarding any matters pertaining to this review should be addressed to the OMB Director.\nThe OMB Director is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nREINCE PRIEBUS", "timestamp": "2017-01-20", "title": "Memorandum from the Chief of Staff on Regulatory Freeze Pending Review"}

Roberts, Jr., administered the oath of office. In his remarks, he referred to former President George W. Bush.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120000", "text": "Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: Thank you.\nWe, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.\nEvery 4 years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.\nToday's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\nFor too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\nThat all changes, starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment: It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our Government, but whether our Government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this Nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.\nYou came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\nThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\nThe oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\nFor many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\nBut that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\nWe, assembled here today, are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\nWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\nWe will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful Nation.\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.\nWe will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example—we will shine—for everyone to follow.\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, \"How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.\" We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear: We are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement, and most importantly, we will be protected by God.\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.\nDo not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\nIt's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\nSo to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\nTogether, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again.\nAnd, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-20", "title": "Inaugural Address"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122485", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n5:39 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER: Good evening. Thank you guys for coming. I know our first official press briefing is going to be on Monday, but I wanted to give you a few updates on the President's activities. But before I get to the news of the day, I think I'd like to discuss a little bit of the coverage of the last 24 hours.\nYesterday, at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and, as the President said, the transition and the balance of power from Washington to the citizens of the United States, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting. For all the talk about the proper use of Twitter, two instances yesterday stand out.\nOne was a particular egregious example in which a reporter falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. After it was pointed out that this was just plain wrong, the reporter casually reported and tweeted out and tried to claim that a Secret Service agent must have just been standing in front of it. This was irresponsible and reckless.\nSecondly, photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. This was the first time in our nation's history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual. This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\nInaccurate numbers involving crowd size were also tweeted. No one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out. By the way, this applies to any attempts to try to count the number of protestors today in the same fashion.\nWe do know a few things, so let's go through the facts. We know that from the platform where the President was sworn in, to 4th Street, it holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the Oath of Office. We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration -- period -- both in person and around the globe. Even the New York Times printed a photograph showing a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original Tweet in their paper, which showed the full extent of the support, depth in crowd, and intensity that existed.\nThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong. The President was also at the -- as you know, the President was also at the Central Intelligence Agency and greeted by a raucous overflow crowd of some 400-plus CIA employees. There were over 1,000 requests to attend, prompting the President to note that he'll have to come back to greet the rest. The employees were ecstatic that he's the new Commander-in-Chief, and he delivered them a powerful and important message. He told them he has their back, and they were grateful for that. They gave him a five-minute standing ovation at the end in a display of their patriotism and their enthusiasm for his presidency.\nI'd also note that it's a shame that the CIA didn't have a CIA Director to be with him today when he visited, because the Democrats have chosen -- Senate Democrats are stalling the nomination of Mike Pompeo and playing politics with national security. That's what you guys should be writing and covering, instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives.\nThe President is committed to unifying our country, and that was the focus of his inaugural address. This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging -- that bringing about our nation together is making it more difficult.\nThere's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I'm here to tell you that it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable, as well. The American people deserve better. And as long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people where his focus will always be.\nAnd with that, a few other updates from the day. The President had a constructive conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada about strengthening the relationship between our two nations. They also discussed setting up additional meetings in the days to come, which we will follow up on. He also spoke to Prime Minister Peña Nieto of Mexico, and talked about a visit on trade, immigration and security that will occur on the 31st. The President will welcome his first foreign leader this Thursday when the United Kingdom's Theresa May will come to Washington -- on Friday.\nTomorrow, the President will oversee his Assistants to the President being sworn in. The staff will then have an ethics briefing, a briefing on the proper use and handling of classified information. Further updates as far as what he will do -- oh, and then in the evening, he will have a reception for law enforcement and first responders that helped support the inauguration.\nThank you guys for being here tonight. I will see you on Monday.\nEND 5:44 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-01-21", "title": "Remarks to the Press by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military. And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did. [Laughter] But I would guarantee a big portion, because we're all on the same wavelength, folks. We're all on the same wavelength, right? He knows. Took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we're on the same wavelength.\nBut we're going to do great things. We're going to do great things. We've been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we've ever fought. We have not used the real abilities that we have. We've been restrained. We have to get rid of ISIS. Have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. Radical Islamic terrorism—and I said it yesterday—has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth. This is evil. This is evil. And you know, I can understand the other side. We can all understand the other side. There can be wars between countries; there can be wars. You can understand what happened. This is something nobody can even understand. This is a level of evil that we haven't seen. And you're going to go to it, and you're going to do a phenomenal job. But we're going to end it. It's time. It's time right now to end it.\nYou have somebody coming on who is extraordinary. For the different positions of \"secretary of this\" and \"secretary of that\" and all of these great positions, I'd see five, six, seven, eight people. And we had a great transition. We had an amazing team of talent. And by the way, General Flynn is right over here. Put up your hand, Mike. What a good guy. And Reince and my whole group. Reince—you know—they don't care about Reince. He's, like, this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right? [Laughter] We don't have to talk about Reince.\nBut we did, we had just such a tremendous, tremendous success. So when I'm interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and in this case, went so quickly—because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, Governor—former Governor of Georgia. Fantastic guy. But I'd see six, seven, eight people for a certain position. Everybody wanted it.\nBut I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met. I didn't want to meet anybody else. I said, cancel everybody else. Cancel. Now, he was approved, essentially, but they're doing little political games with me. He was one of the three. Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved. And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group. It was going to be the three of them. Can you imagine all of these guys? They—people respect—you know, they respect that military sense. All my political people, they're not doing so well. The political people aren't doing so well, but you. We're going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others. But Mike was literally—I had a group of what, we had nine different people? Now, I must say, I didn't mind cancelling eight appointments. That wasn't the worst thing in the world. But I met him, and I said, he is so good. Number one in his class at West Point.\nNow, I know a lot about West Point. And to be one, you're—it's—I'm a person that very strongly believes in academics. In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways. Academically—he was an academic genius—and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual? Trust me, I'm, like, a smart person. [Laughter] And I recognized immediately. So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School. And then, he decided to go into the military. And he ran for Congress. And everything he's done has been a home run. People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him. And when I told Paul Ryan that I want to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled, right, Mike? Because he said, I don't want to lose this guy.\nBut you will be getting a total star. You're going to be getting a total gem. This is a gem. And I just—[applause]—good. You'll see. You'll see. And many of you know him anyway. But you're going to see. And again, we have some great people going in. But this one is something—going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps—you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important. You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing. There can be—and the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful. But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier. And boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly. And that's what we have to do. We have to start winning again.\nYou know, when I was young and when I was—of course, I feel young. I feel like I'm 30, 35, 39. [Laughter] Somebody said, are you young? I said, I think I'm young. You know, I was stopping—when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops. Speeches, speeches, in front of 25, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop. I feel young.\nBut when I was young—and I think we're all, sort of, young. When I was young, we were always winning things in this country. We'd win with trade. We'd win with wars. At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, \"The United States has never lost a war.\" And then, after that, it's like we haven't won anything. We don't win anymore. The old expression, \"To the victor belong the spoils\"—you remember. I always used to say, keep the oil. I wasn't a fan of Iraq. I didn't want to go into Iraq. But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong. And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil. Now, I said it for economic reasons. But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn't have ISIS because that's where they made their money in the first place. So we should have kept the oil. But okay. [Laughter] Maybe you'll have another chance. But the fact is, should have kept the oil.\nI believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems. We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don't even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused. So I can only say that I am with you a thousand percent.\nAnd the reason you're my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. [Laughter] Right? And they, sort of, made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you're the number-one stop is exactly the opposite—exactly. And they understand that too.\nAnd I was explaining about the numbers. We did a thing yesterday at the speech. Did everybody like the speech? You had to like it, right? So I've been given good reviews. But we had a massive field of people. You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I say, wait a minute, I made a speech. [Laughter] I looked out, the field was—it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well. [Laughter] I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down, and he said, we're not going to let it rain on your speech.\nIn fact, I—when I first started, I said, oh, no. First line, I hit—got hit by a couple of drops. [Laughter] And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we'll go right through it. But the truth is that it stopped immediately. It was amazing. And then, it became really sunny. Then, I walked off and it poured right after I left. It poured. But you know, we have something that's amazing because we had—it looked—honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on—and by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that's not bad, but it's a lie. We had 250,000 people literally around, you know, in the little bowl that we constructed. That was 250,000 people. The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed. So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty. And I think they're going to pay a big price.\nWe had another one yesterday, which was interesting. In the Oval Office there's a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King. And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill. I think most of us like Churchill. Doesn't come from our country, but had a lot to do with it. Helped us; real ally. And as you know, Churchill's statue was taken out—the bust. And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly. And they wanted to know whether or not I'd like it back. I'd say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill.\nSo a reporter for Time magazine—and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times. I think we have the alltime record in the history of Time magazine. Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it's one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right? [Laughter] I've been on for 15 times this year. I don't think that's a record, Mike, that can ever be broken. Do you agree with that? [Laughter] What do you think?\nBut I will say that they said—and it was very interesting—that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But there was a cameraman that was in front of it. [Laughter] So Zeke—Zeke from Time magazine writes a story about I took down. I would never do that because I had great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But this is how dishonest the media is.\nNow, big story—the retraction was, like, where? What, was it a line? Or do they even bother putting it in? So I only like to say that because I love honesty. I like honest reporting.\nI will tell you, final time—although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in—because I am coming back—we may have to get you a larger room. [Laughter] We may have to get you a larger room. You know? And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won't have columns. [Laughter] Do you understand that? We'd get rid of the columns, but—[laughter]. No, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you. There's nobody I respect more. You're going to do a fantastic job. And we're going to start winning again, and you're going to be leading the charge.\nSo thank you all very much. Thank you, beautiful. Thank you all very much. Have a good time. I'll be back. I'll be back. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-21", "title": "Remarks at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia"}

This group of assistants to the President is being commissioned this afternoon as officers of the President of the United States. President Trump has commissioned only 30 assistants to the President for his administration, and it will by my high honor and distinct privilege to swear each of you in to these extraordinary responsibilities that you will accept today.\nWith that, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's very nice. I just went to the Oval Office and found this beautiful letter from President Obama. It was really very nice of him to do that, and we will cherish that. We will keep that. And we won't even tell the press what's in that letter. [Laughter]\nI want to start off by telling you I just spoke with Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia—great State, great people. Florida affected, Alabama affected by the tornadoes and just expressed our sincere condolences for the lives taken. Tornadoes were vicious and powerful and strong, and they suffered greatly. So we'll be helping out the State of Georgia. We'll be speaking with Governor Scott right after this, and we'll be—Alabama is a special place, Florida a special place, but they got hit hard. They all got hit hard. But it looks like Georgia has lost at least 11 people as of this moment; that's a lot of people. So on behalf of all of us, Governor Deal, condolences.\nWe are going to tell you that this has been a very interesting few days. We have set up meetings with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Prime Minister May will be coming over to the United States shortly. We're also meeting with the Prime Minister of Canada, and we will be meeting with the President of Mexico who I know, and we're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA.\nAnybody ever hear of NAFTA? [Laughter] I ran a campaign somewhat based on NAFTA. But we're going to start renegotiating on NAFTA, on immigration, and on security at the border. And Mexico has been terrific, actually terrific. And the President has been really very amazing, and I think we're going to have a very good result for Mexico, for the United States, and for everybody involved. It's very important. It's a very, very important thing.\nAnd speaking of important, you're very important, because with you and all of the people in this room, we are going to do some great things over the next 8 years. Okay? Eight years. Right? [Applause] Right? Great group. This is a great group of people. And if they're not, I will let you know about it. This is the bad news about being the—I will let you know if they're not doing the job, okay? [Laughter] I'll praise them if they're doing it, and I'll let you know if they're not doing it, but they will do it. They're going to do a fantastic job. I'm so proud of them. I know them so well.\nEach and every one of you should be extremely proud. Give yourselves a round of applause. Come on, give yourselves a round of applause.\nTo your family and friends who are gathered here today, I want them all to know how important you are to the functioning of the White House and, ultimately, to the functioning of the United States of America. I also want to thank the families here today for all you have done to support your loved ones as they've devoted their time and energy to causes of public service, including many long nights—they'll be away—long, long nights, and that will go on for a long, long time. But we're going to come out way ahead. We're going to come out way, way ahead as a nation, as a country, we're going to come out way ahead, because I know what we have; I know how talented these people are.\nWe're also a team—it's a team, it's a great team. It's a team that gets along. And as I said during my Inaugural Address, this is not about party. This is not about ideology. This is about country, our country. And it's about serving the American people.\nWe're not here to help ourselves. We're here to devote ourselves to the national good. Public service is a high and great calling. It's our solemn duty, together, to protect the country, our country, this great, great country; to defend its workers and promote the well-being of all Americans. So many people are depending on us and on you as families, you as people that are going to get it done. So many people: the veterans, the unemployed, men and women serving in harm's way overseas, victims of crime, and young Americans looking to fulfill their dreams. So many of those young Americans, and they're going to be fulfilling their dreams. We're going to make it much easier for them.\nWe will face many challenges, but with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done. We will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history. So be proud. Be very proud.\nNow, I began with this gentleman right here. I said, Mike, how about it? And he said, not even a question. And it was a great decision for me. So Mike Pence, our fabulous Vice President of the United States, will administer the oath of office. And congratulations to everybody. Congratulations.\nVice President Pence. And now the oath of office.

And we don't want to bring them in, we want to make them here. And that doesn't mean we don't trade, because we do trade. But we want to make our products here. And if you look at some of the original great people that ran this country, you will see that they felt very strongly about that—got to make your products. And we're going to start making our products again. And there will be advantages to companies that do, indeed, make their products here. So we've seen it. It's going to get—it's going to be a wave. You watch, it's going to be a wave. And I've always said, by the time you put them in these massive ships or airplanes and fly them, I think it's going to be cheaper.\nNow, what we're doing is, we are going to be cutting taxes massively for both the middle class and for companies. And that's massively. We're trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent, and it's now 35 percent. But it's probably more 38 percent than it is 35, wouldn't you say? That's a big thing.\nA bigger thing—and that surprised me—is the fact that we're going to be cutting regulation massively. Now, we're going to have regulation, and it will be just as strong and just as good and just as protective of the people as the regulation we have right now. The problem with the regulation that we have right now is that you can't do anything. You can't—I have people that tell me they have more people working on regulations than they have doing product. And it's out of control. It's gotten out of control. I'm a very big person when it comes to the environment. I've received awards on the environment. But some of that stuff makes it impossible to get anything built.\nIt takes years and years—I have—you can look at some examples. I read one recently where a man has been trying to build a factory for many, many years, and his vote was going to be fairly soon, and he gave up because he wasn't going to win the vote. Spent millions and millions of dollars. Ruined his—actually ruined his life. And we can't have that.\nSo when somebody wants to put up a factory, it's going to be expedited. And you have to go through the process, but it's going to be expedited. And we're going to take care of the environment, we're going to take care of safety and all of the other things we have to take care of. But you're going to get such great service. There will be no country that's going to be faster, better, more fair, and at the same time, protecting the people of the country, whether it's safety or so many other reasons where regulations are good.\nWe think we can cut regulations by 75 percent—maybe more, but by 75 percent; have, in a certain way, better protections, but when you want to expand your plant, or when Mark wants to come in and build a big massive plant, or when Dell wants to come in and do something monstrous and special—[laughter]—you're going to have your approvals really fast.\nDell Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael S. Dell. Thank you, sir. [Laughter]\nThe President. Okay? And the one thing that surprised me, then I want to hear what you have to say, but the one thing that surprised me in going around and meeting with a lot of the people at this table and meeting with a lot of the small-business owners, if I gave them a choice of this massive tax decrease that we're giving for business—for everybody, but for business—or the cutting down of regulation, if I took a vote, I think I'd—the regulation wins a hundred percent.\nNow, in one case, it's hard dollars, and the other case, it's regulation. You would think that the regulations would have no chance. It's, it's—I've never seen anything like it. Virtually everybody is happier with regulation than even cutting their taxes. So the regulations are going to be cut massively, and the taxes are going to be cut way down. So you're going to have now incentive—incentive—to build.\nThe one thing I do have to warn you about: When you have a company here, you have a plant here—it's going to be in Indiana or it's in Ohio or it's in Michigan or it's in North Carolina or Pennsylvania, anywhere in this country—when it decides, when you decide, if you decide to close it—and you no longer will have a real reason because your taxes are going to be lower. And by the way, if you go to another State, that's it, that's great. If you can go from Ohio to Indiana—[laughter]—or from Indiana to Ohio, that's fine. So you have 50 great, wonderful Governors to negotiate with. So it's not like we're taking away competition.\nBut if you go to another country and you decide that you're going to close and get rid of 2,000 people or 5,000 people—I tell you, United Technologies was an example with Carrier, and I got involved, you know, 2 years after they announced. So in all fairness, that was tough, but United Technologies was terrific, and they brought back many of those jobs. But if that happens, we are going to be imposing a very major border tax on the product when it comes in, which I think is fair. Which is fair.\nSo a company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States and build some factory someplace else, and then thinks that that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States, that's not going to happen. They're going to have a tax to pay, a border tax, substantial border tax.\nNow, some people would say, that's not free trade, but we don't have free trade now, because we're the only one that makes it easy to come into the country. If you look at China, if you look at many other countries—I don't have to name them—but many other countries, they can't believe what we do. So we take in things free, and yet if you want to take a plant or you want to do something, you want to sell something into China and other countries, it's very, very hard. And in some cases, it's impossible; they won't even take your product. But when they do take your product, they charge a lot of tax.\nSo I don't call that free trade. What we want is fair trade—fair trade. And we're going to treat countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly. And if they're going to charge tax to our countries [companies; White House correction.]—if, as an example, we sell a car into Japan and they do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan and yet they sell cars into us and they come in, like, by the hundreds of thousands on the biggest ships I've ever seen, we have to all talk about that. It's not fair. It's not fair. Never was. I just can't believe it took so long for somebody to come along.\nSo that's the only thing I will tell you. So, essentially, I'm talking about no tax, because if you stay here, there's no tax. Somebody would say, \"Oh, Trump is going to tax.\" I'm not going to tax. There is no tax. None whatsoever. And I just want to tell you, all you have to do is stay. Don't leave. Don't fire your people in the United States. We have the greatest people. And many other countries have the great people too. I mean, we all have great people. Okay? This isn't that kind of a competition. Everybody has great people. But if we're going to fire people and build a product outside, not going to happen.\nThank you. So with that, we'll take some questions. Marillyn, do you want to start? I've gotten to know Marillyn very well. We've been deep in negotiation. [Laughter]", "timestamp": "2017-01-23", "title": "Remarks at a Breakfast and Listening Session With Business Leaders"}

And if somebody misbehaves, we're going to send them a letter of termination, 30 days, and they'll either straighten it out, or we're gone.

Trump today signed a series of Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda in keeping with his promise to reduce the burden of regulations and expedite high priority energy and infrastructure projects that will create jobs and increase national security.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline\nWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump will help fulfill the campaign promise of initiating the process for approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.\nThe Keystone XL Pipeline is an 1,100-mile crude oil pipeline to connect oil production in Alberta, Canada to refineries in the United States.\nConstruction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, as well as oil production and refining activities related to it, would create tens of thousands of jobs for American workers, enhance our nation's energy security, support affordable and reliable energy for American families, and generate significant State and local tax revenues that can be invested in schools, hospitals, and infrastructure.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline\nWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump directed the relevant Federal agencies (including the Army Corps of Engineers) to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining portions of the Dakota Access Pipeline., a $3.8 billion, 1,100-mile pipeline designed to carry around 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the U.S.\nAt this time, DAPL is more than 90% complete across its entire route. Only a limited stretch of the project is not yet constructed. Timely review and approval of energy pipelines is critical to a strong economy, energy independence, and national security.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of American Pipelines\nIn keeping with his commitment to \"Buy American, Hire American\", President Trump directed the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with all relevant executive departments and agencies, to develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States, including portions of pipelines, use materials and equipment produced in the United States, to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall submit the plan to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum.\nPresidential Memorandum Streamlining Permitting and Reducing Regulatory Burdens for Domestic Manufacturing\nWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump helps fulfill the campaign promise of boosting domestic manufacturing by determining a plan of action for expediting approvals for manufacturing and reducing regulatory burdens.\nUnder this Presidential Memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce will conduct outreach to stakeholders and solicit comments from the public concerning Federal actions to streamline permitting and reduce regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturers.\nThe Commerce Secretary will submit a report to the President identifying recommendations to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturers.

Purpose. Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American families and consumers. Too often, infrastructure projects in the United States have been routinely and excessively delayed by agency processes and procedures. These delays have increased project costs and blocked the American people from the full benefits of increased infrastructure investments, which are important to allowing Americans to compete and win on the world economic stage. Federal infrastructure decisions should be accomplished with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, while also respecting property rights and protecting public safety and the environment. To that end, it is the policy of the executive branch to streamline and expedite, in a manner consistent with law, environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially projects that are a high priority for the Nation, such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.\nSec. 2. Identification of High Priority Infrastructure Projects. With respect to infrastructure projects for which Federal reviews and approvals are required, upon request by the Governor of a State, or the head of any executive department or agency (agency), or on his or her own initiative, the Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall, within 30 days after a request is made, decide whether an infrastructure project qualifies as a \"high priority\" infrastructure project. This determination shall be made after consideration of the project's importance to the general welfare, value to the Nation, environmental benefits, and such other factors as the Chairman deems relevant.\nSec. 3. Deadlines. With respect to any project designated as a high priority under section 2 of this order, the Chairman of the CEQ shall coordinate with the head of the relevant agency to establish, in a manner consistent with law, expedited procedures and deadlines for completion of environmental reviews and approvals for such projects. All agencies shall give highest priority to completing such reviews and approvals by the established deadlines using all necessary and appropriate means. With respect to deadlines established consistent with this section that are not met, the head of the relevant agency shall provide a written explanation to the Chairman explaining the causes for the delay and providing concrete actions taken by the agency to complete such reviews and approvals as expeditiously as possible.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(c) All actions taken pursuant to this order shall be consistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods. Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.\n(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

What, did you have a slow plane or [laughter]? It's the slowest. The longest trip.\nMr. Marchionne. I stopped in Detroit on the way over.\nThe President. That's good. That's a good place to stop.

Mary, I promise—[laughter]—but to have a lot of plants from a lot of different items built in the United States.\nAnd it's happening. It's happening, big league. And we had Whirlpool up yesterday. We're talking about big construction of facilities. And it's not the construction I want—although that brings jobs—it's the long-term jobs that we're looking for. We're bringing manufacturing back to the United States big league. We're reducing taxes very substantially. And we're reducing unnecessary regulations. And we want regulations, but we want real regulations that mean something. Mark and I were together yesterday, and I think we understand that.\nAnd we're going to make the process much more simple for the auto companies and for everybody else that wants to do business in the United States. I think you're going to find this to be from very inhospitable to extremely hospitable. I think we'll go down as one of the most friendly countries. And right now it's not. I mean, I have friends that want to build in the United States; they go many, many years, and then, they can't get their environmental permit over something that nobody ever heard of before. And it's absolutely crazy.\nAnd I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist. I believe in it. But it's out of control. And we're going to make a very short process.

We are, and I am, very insistent that if we're going to build pipelines in the United States, the pipes should be made in the United States.

Trump", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on January 30.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122517", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:\nSection 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.\nTransnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.\nFederal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws—and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders—the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:\n(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;\n(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;\n(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States; (d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and\n(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.\nSec. 3. Definitions. (a) \"Asylum officer\" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).\n(b) \"Southern border\" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.\n(c) \"Border States\" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.\n(d) Except as otherwise noted, \"the Secretary\" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n(e) \"Wall\" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.\n(f) \"Executive department\" shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.\n(g) \"Regulations\" shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.\n(h) \"Operational control\" shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.\nSec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:\n(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\n(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\n(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\n(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\nSec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\n(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.\n(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.\nSec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as \"catch and release,\" whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.\nSec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.\nSec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.\nSec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.\nSec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).\n(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.\n(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.\nSec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.\n(a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.\n(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.\n(c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).\n(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.\n(e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.\nSec. 12. Authorization to Enter Federal Lands. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:\n(a) permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement this order; and\n(b) enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to implement this order.\nSec. 13. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General shall take all appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern border.\nSec. 14. Government Transparency. The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily understandable by the public.\nSec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order.\nSec. 16. Hiring. The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.\nSec. 17. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Purpose. Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.\nSanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.\nTens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails. The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.\nAlthough Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:\n(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;\n(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;\n(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;\n(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and\n(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens. Sec. 3. Definitions. The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.\nSec. 4. Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States. In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.\nSec. 5. Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:\n(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;\n(b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;\n(c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;\n(d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;\n(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;\n(f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or\n(g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\nSec. 6. Civil Fines and Penalties. As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States.\nSec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357).\nSec. 8. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).\n(b) To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the\nSecretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.\n(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction.\nSec. 9. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.\n(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction. The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.\n(b) To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\n(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction.\nSec. 10. Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies. (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as \"Secure Communities\" referenced in that memorandum.\n(b) The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law.\n(c) To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies.\nSec. 11. Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators. The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States.\nSec. 12. Recalcitrant Countries. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate. The Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States.\nSec. 13. Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.\nSec. 14. Privacy Act. Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.\nSec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order within 90 days of the date of this order and again within 180 days of the date of this order.\nSec. 16. Transparency. To promote the transparency and situational awareness of criminal aliens in the United States, the Secretary and the Attorney General are hereby directed to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports on the following:\n(a) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons;\n(b) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated as Federal pretrial detainees under the supervision of the United States Marshals Service; and\n(c) the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States.\nSec. 17.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very proud of you. Thank you. Wow. You love your job, don't you, huh? That's beautiful. [Applause] That's so nice. Great. Great people. Thank you very much.\nFirst, I want to congratulate Secretary John Kelly and his wife Kathleen [Karen; White House correction.]—where is Kathleen? She's here someplace. John brings the skills, the leadership, background, the experience, strength, and definitely that determination that you have to have to get the job done and to get it done correctly. He will deliver for you. He will deliver for the country. He will deliver for the American people like you've never seen before.\nWe also just finished a briefing with the Acting Administrator of FEMA, Bob Fenton, and we discussed the terrible storms that struck the southeastern United States. Our Nation sends its thoughts and prayers to everyone impacted by this incredible tragedy. I've instructed FEMA to do all they can to help those suffering and affected. Already we've approved Georgia and Mississippi, and others are rapidly on their way. So FEMA has done an incredible job of speed, and they need speed. Homeland Security is in the business of saving lives, and that mandate will guide our actions.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has many, many different divisions. But one of the most important missions of DHS is its law enforcement mission; this is a law enforcement agency. But for too long, your officers and agents haven't been allowed to properly do their jobs—you know that, right? Do you know that? Absolutely. But that's all about to change, and I'm very happy about it, and you're very happy about it. From here on out, I'm asking all of you to enforce the laws of the United States of America. They will be enforced and enforced strongly.\nBecause people are surprised to hear that we do not need new laws. We will work within the existing system and framework. We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States. Before we go any further, I want to recognize the ICE and Border Patrol officers in this room today and to honor their service and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for President. [Laughter] That helps, but that's not the only reason.\nI also want to acknowledge two individuals in the audience who will play a very, very important role going forward. I'd like to recognize Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, and Chris Crane—two friends of mine—president of National ICE Council. You guys are about to be very, very busy doing your job the way you want to do them. Where are they? Where are those guys? Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much.\nWe are in the middle of a crisis on our southern border. The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States. And I believe the steps we will take, starting right now, will improve the safety in both of our countries. It's going to be very, very good for Mexico. A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders, gets back its borders. Thank you. I just signed two Executive orders that will save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and billions and billions of dollars. These two orders are part of an immigration reform we outlined during the campaign.\nI want to emphasize that we will working in partnership with our friends in Mexico to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border. I have deep admiration for the people of Mexico, and I greatly look forward to meeting again with the President of Mexico. We'll be doing that shortly. We will discuss close coordination on many, many important issues between our countries. This coordination includes the dismantling of cartels and keeping illegal weapons and cash from flowing out of America and into Mexico—out of our country, out of the United States, and it goes right into Mexico. They have to stop it. We have to stop it.\nWe are going to save lives on both sides of the border, and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States, very, very good. We want that to happen. By working together on a positive trade, safe borders, and economic cooperation, I truly believe we can enhance the relationship between our two nations to a degree not seen before, certainly in a very, very long time. I think our relationship with Mexico is going to get better.\nHere is a brief summary of what actions are contained in my Executive orders. The Secretary of Homeland Security, working with myself and my staff, will begin immediate construction of a border wall. So badly needed. You folks know how badly needed it is as a help, but very badly needed. This will also help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration from Central America and by disrupting violent cartel networks.\nAs I've said repeatedly to the country, we are going to get the bad ones out: the criminals and the drug deals and gangs and gang members and cartel leaders. The day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc. We are going to get them out, and we're going to get them out fast, and John Kelly is going to lead that way.\nOur order also does the following: ends the policy of catch-and-release at the border; requires other countries to take back their criminals—they will take them back; cracks down on sanctuary cities; empowers ICE officers to target and remove those who pose a threat to public safety; calls for the hiring of another 5,000 Border Patrol officers; calls for the tripling the number of ICE officers. And you both do an incredible job, but you need help, you need more. Creates an Office in Homeland Security dedicated to supporting the victims of illegal immigrant crime.\nFor years, the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents victimized by open borders. To all of those hurting out there, I repeat to you these words: We hear you, we see you, and you will never, ever be ignored again. As I traveled the country, I had the chance to get to know mothers who have lost their children to violence spilling over the border. I want to thank the Remembrance Project—such incredible people—for giving these families a voice. They're called Angel Moms for good reason, because they are a voice to protect all of America's children. Their children have not died in vain, believe me.\nPundits talk about how enforcing immigration laws can separate illegal immigrant families, but the families they don't talk about are the families of Americans forever separated from the people they love. They don't talk about that ever. As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people. First, these families lost their loved ones. Then, they endured a system that ignored them, while at the same time constantly rewarding those who broke the law. For these families, it's been one injustice after another. But that all turns around beginning today.\nWe are joined here this afternoon by parents whose children were horribly killed by individuals living here illegally. I will now read these parents' names and ask them to stand. Many have become friends of mine over the last 2 years and have supported me so dearly, and I appreciate it.\nMary Ann Mendoza, who lost her son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza. Fred Funderburgh and his son James, who lost Billy. Billy was Fred's son and James's brother. Billy's wife Natalee was also killed by an illegal immigrant, somebody that should never, ever have been here. Laura Wilkerson, who lost her 17-year-old son, beautiful Josh. Josh was special. Where is Laura? Good. Laura, thank you. Thank you, Laura. Carrie Ruiz and Lucio Ruiz, Jr., who lost their young daughter Felicia. Thank you. Beautiful Felicia. Thank you very much. Thank you. Steven Ronnebeck, who lost his 21-year-old son Grant. Thank you, Steven.\nAnd we have many others with us from Remembrance and from other groups, and these are incredible people that have endured so much. And I just want to thank everybody for being here. Very, very special people. Thank you.\nNothing can ever make their pain go away, but I want you to know, your children will not have lost their lives for no reason. They've set this incredible goal for so many. These were great, young people. And they will always be remembered—always. We will never forget them.\nAnd to the parents and loved ones: You kept the flame of justice alive with your activism. Keep it going. And now, together, we will save thousands and thousands of lives. When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics. No Republicans, no Democrats—just citizens, and good citizens. We want safe communities, and we demand safe communities for everyone. We want respect. We want great schools. We want dignity and equality for everyone. And I will be a President, I promise you, for everyone.\nWe will bridge our divisions, heal our wounds, and unify our country. And if we do that, if we work together, then there is nothing we cannot achieve as Americans. The future is limitless.\nGood luck to our new and brilliant leader at DHS, General John Kelly. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Congratulations to John.", "timestamp": "2017-01-25", "title": "Remarks at the Department of Homeland Security"}

More choices for our students will make our schools better for everybody.\nOur country is home to many great schools and many extraordinary teachers—whether they serve in traditional public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, private or religious schools, or in homeschooling environments.\nWith a renewed commitment to expanding school choice for our children, we can truly make a great education possible for every child in America.\nI commend our Nation's students, parents, teachers, and school leaders for their commitment to quality, effective education, and I call on States and communities to support effective education and school choice for every child in America.\nAs our country celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage parents to evaluate the educational opportunities available for their children.

Thank you very much, Mitch. So nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So nice. Nice to win, do we agree? It's been a while. It's been a while since we had this position. Nice to win. And I want to thank everybody in the room. So many friends. Thank you very much. Sit down, everybody. Let's enjoy ourselves. [Laughter]\nIt's great to be in Philadelphia. I went to school in Philadelphia. This is a very special place in our Nation's history. It's the place where we launched our American independence. The State of Pennsylvania is very special to me for lots of reasons, especially from a couple of months ago, remember? \"Pennsylvania cannot be won,\" remember? [Laughter] \"Pennsylvania cannot be won,\" right, Congressman? \"There is no path to victory for Trump in Pennsylvania.\" Except we won.\nNow, it has been a long time since you guys did this, but it was just a great victory. It was a great evening. It was a great evening, I will tell you. But it, sort of, started in Pennsylvania. They all said that Pennsylvania was the bride that got away, that it was the State that everybody from the Republican Party that ran in Pennsylvania for 38 years thought they won, except they never won. And I thought I won too, but I was afraid to say it, Mitch, because it just seemed that it wasn't working out. So I just said, you know what, I think we did great, let's see what happens. But good things happened. So we love this State, and we will see it many times again.\nNow is the dawn of a new era of American independence, a rededication to the idea that the people are in charge of their own destiny.\nI want to thank Majority Leader McConnell, great guy, and Speaker Paul Ryan, very, very special. And he is writing his heart out, right? And we're actually going to sign the stuff that you're writing. You're not wasting your time. He would write, and he'd send it up, and nothing would happen, but now it's going to happen. For their leadership and for inviting me here today, thank you very much.\nAnd thank you, Leader McCarthy, Senator Cornyn, Congressman Scalise, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and Congressman Messer for your leadership as well. It's been terrific. This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever. Maybe ever, think of that. And think of everything we can achieve, and remember who we must achieve it for.\nWe're here now because tens of millions of Americans have placed their hopes in us to transfer power from Washington, DC, and give it back to the people. [Applause] So important. Now we have to deliver. Enough all talk, no action. We have to deliver. This is our chance to achieve great and lasting change for our beloved Nation.\nSince taking office, I have taken major contractual steps to restore the rule of law and to return power to everyday Americans. And even though it's only a few days, we've done it in record numbers. We've issued Executive orders to build the Keystone and Dakota pipelines and issued a new requirement for American pipelines to be made with American steel and fabricated in the United States. And I was sitting at my desk, and I'm getting ready to sign Keystone and Dakota, I say, where's the pipe coming from—and I won't tell you where, but you wouldn't be happy. [Laughter] I say, why is it we build pipelines and we're not using pipe that's made in our country? I say, let's put that little clause in. Like, it's a one-sentence clause, but that clause is going to attract a lot of people, and we're going to make that pipe right here in America, okay?\nIf people want to build pipelines on our land, we want the pipe to be manufactured—and, not only that, manufactured here, but you will see a level of quality that you're not going to see when they bring pipe from far distances. Have to bring it in small chunks and then fabricate it on the land. I mean, give me a break. We can do much better than that, and we're going to do it much better, and it's going to end up costing less money, believe me.\nWe've reinstated the Mexico City Policy, a longstanding policy. [Applause] Isn't that nice? And by the way, on Friday, a lot of people are going to be showing up to Washington, right, Mike? A lot of people. You know, the press never gives them the credit that they deserve. They'll have 300, 400, 500, 600,000 people; you won't even read about it. When other people show up you, read big time about it, right? So it's not fair, but nothing fair about the media. [Laughter] Nothing. A longstanding policy to ensure taxpayer dollars do not fund abortion services overseas.\nWe've issued Executive orders to remove wasteful regulations that slow down commerce and delay infrastructure, which we desperately need—the very beginning of a massive effort to reduce the crushing regulations on our economy—and we are going to reduce regulations big time.\nWe've also withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, paving the way for new, one-on-one trade deals that protect and defend the American worker, and believe me, we're going to have a lot of trade deals. Mitch, don't worry about it. Just give me a little time. [Laughter]\nBut they'll be one-on-one. They won't be a whole, big mash-pot. They'll be one-on-one deals and if that particular country doesn't treat us fairly, we send them a 30-day termination—notice of termination. And then, they'll come and say, please don't do that, and we'll negotiate a better deal during that 30-day period. [Laughter] The other way, you can't get out of it. It's like quicksand.\nPlus, we're going to have very, very strong controls over monetary manipulation and devaluation, which they didn't have in TPP. So this is going to be so much better, and we're already on it. I would like to have my Commerce Secretary Wilbur approved, because I hear he did fantastically well. But they're not quick with the pen on signing these people, because we'd like to have him approved as soon as possible.\nSenate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell. It will be done.\nThe President. So, I know, and Mitch says it will be done, and it will be. They could move faster on the other side, I will say that. [Laughter] Could move faster. I mean, I'm meeting with the Prime Minister tomorrow, as you know, Great Britain. So I'm meeting with her tomorrow. I don't have my Commerce Secretary. And they want to talk trade. So I'll have to handle it myself, which is okay. [Laughter]\nWe've put in place the first steps in our immigration plan: ordering the immediate construction of the border wall, putting an end to catch-and-release, expediting the removal of criminal—this is so important to me. From day one, I've said it, and I mean the immediate removal of criminal aliens. They're going to be gone, fast. And finally, at long last, cracking down on sanctuary cities.\nIt's time to restore the civil rights of Americans: to protect their jobs, their hopes, and their dreams for a much better future.\nCongress passed these laws to serve our citizens, and it's about time those laws were properly enforced. They're not enforced. The hour of justice for the American worker has arrived. Border security is a serious, serious national issue and problem. A lack of security poses a substantial threat to the sovereignty and safety of the United States of America and its citizens.\nMost illegal immigration is coming from our southern border. I've said many times that the American people will not pay for the wall, and I've made that clear to the Government of Mexico.\nNAFTA has been a terrible deal, a total disaster for the United States from its inception, costing us as much as $60 billion a year with Mexico alone in trade deficits. You say who? Who negotiates these deals? Not to mention millions of jobs and thousands and thousands of factories and plants closing down all over our country. On top of that are the trillions of dollars the U.S. taxpayers have spent to pay the cost of illegal immigration. Much of it has then been sent back, and much of it goes back to other countries. And oftentimes, because they don't respect us, the other countries will not accept the criminals that we send back to them that are illegally in our country. I promise you, they will start accepting them again, quickly. We're not going to have them any longer.\nI will not allow the taxpayers or the citizens of the United States to pay the cost of this defective transaction—NAFTA—one that should have been renegotiated many years ago, except that the politicians were too preoccupied to do so. Now, these people are not in that category, you understand that; this is a different group. I think. [Laughter] Right?\nTo that end, the President of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week. Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. We have no choice. Paul Ryan and other leaders in Congress and I and Mike Pence who—by the way, how good a choice was Vice President Mike Pence? Stand up. [Applause] Everybody loves him. In fact, any time I got myself into a jam early—you know I haven't been doing this stuff too long, right? [Laughter] But any time I got myself into a jam, oftentimes, they'd say on television, yes, but look, he picked Mike Pence—[laughter]—so he's got to have something going, right? [Laughter] So Mike really helped me a lot.\nWhile we're working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports, and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route. It is time that the American people had a President fighting as hard for its citizens as other countries do for theirs. And that's exactly what I am going to do for you, believe me. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nIt's time that somebody fought for our country and didn't let anyone take advantage of us anymore. The world has taken advantage of us for many years; it's not going to happen anymore. We will have an ambitious legislative agenda as well. Our legislative work starts with repealing and replacing Obamacare and saving families from the catastrophic rise in premiums and debilitating loss of choice and just about everything else. And remember this, for this room in particular, Obamacare is a disaster. The Democrats are up, and they're saying, oh—they're putting up signs like it's wonderful. It's a disaster. I actually talked with Paul and the group about just doing nothing for 2 years, and the Dems would come begging to do something, because '17 is going to be catastrophic price increases. Your deductibles are through the roof; you can't use it. You can't use it. And they would come to us. Except we have one problem: We have to take care of the American people immediately. So we can't wait.\nBut every time they tell you about Obamacare, we're taking them out of a big jam—big jam. We're putting ourselves at risk to a certain extent because we're taking it off their platter. But I think, Congressmen, I think we have no choice. I think we have no choice. We have to get it going. If we—I'm serious: If we waited 2 years, it's going to explode like you've never seen an explosion. Nobody is going to be able to afford it. It's a disaster. And that's politically what we should do, but we don't want to do that. We want to get something done and get it done right. And by the way, Tom Price is going to do a phenomenal job. I don't know if he's here, but he's going to do a phenomenal job.\nOn my first day in office, I signed an Executive order to roll back the burdens of Obamacare and pave the way for real reform, like health savings accounts that empower individuals to choose the customized plan that is truly right for them and have so many choices. Tom Price will soon be leading Health and Human Services. He is a true advocate for patients. He's going to do a phenomenal job. We have no doubt about that. He joins an all-star roster that includes many of your colleagues: Ryan Zinke, Mick Mulvaney. These guys have had a pretty tough time in Congress too, but they—in the Senate, but actually came out very well. Mike Pompeo. Is Mike here? Mike? Mike Pompeo, phenomenal guy. And Jeff Sessions—[applause]—Jeff is a fine person. Jeff was one of my earliest endorsers and never endorsed a Presidential candidate before, and he was one of my earliest endorsers, respected by everybody and did unbelievably in front of committee. Unbelievable.\nIn addition to fixing our health care, we're going to pursue new trade deals that create higher wages and more opportunities for American workers bringing back those magnificent words: Made in the U.S.A. We used to have that. We don't have it anymore.\nIt's going to be America first again. We will create millions of new good-paying jobs by removing the economic burdens that cripple our ability to compete. At the center of that agenda is bold tax reform that massively lowers taxes for our middle class and for all American businesses.\nWe will also pursue financial reform that will help striving Americans get the credit they need to realize their dreams. Republicans have always been the party of American industry and the American worker. We must embrace that heritage, rebuilding this country with American goods and American labor. And we've started, believe me, over the last couple of months. I don't know, I'd like to say I did about as much as anybody or more in terms of getting industry to start coming back to our country before I took office. But we have a lot of great news with Ford and General Motors and Fiat Chrysler and so many others. We have a lot of great news. Lockheed is adding a lot of different people, a lot of additional people—Boeing. We have a lot of positive things happening, and it's really going to start bursting out. You're going to be seeing it very soon.\nWe want to get our people off of welfare and back to work. So important. It's out of control. It's out of control. And we believe that the world's best country ought to have the world's best infrastructure. It's what our people deserve. And it's what we will ensure they get. Our infrastructure is in serious trouble. We will build new roads and highways and tunnels and airports and railways across the Nation. We will fix our existing product before we build anything brandnew, however. We have to fix what we have. It's a mess. So we're going to fix it first. The thing I do best in life is build. We will fix it first, because we have a lot of things that are in bad shape.\nAnd we will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [Applause] Thank you. And we're working hard with the veterans. We're going to do something very special with the veterans. It's time.\nAt the same time, we will unleash the full power of American energy, ending the job-killing restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, and clean, beautiful coal. And we're going to put our coal miners back to work. [Applause] Thank you.\nAnd we will protect our farmers, our ranchers, our hunters, our anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Right now too many families don't feel secure. Just look at the 30 largest cities. In the last year alone, the murder rate has increased by an estimated 14 percent.\nHere in Philadelphia, the murder rate has been steady—I mean just terribly increasing. And then, you look at Chicago. What's going on in Chicago? I said the other day, what the hell is going on?\nAudience member. Democrats. [Laughter]\nThe President. Lot of truth to that. [Laughter] That is why we will continue to stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\nYesterday I had the honor of swearing in General John Kelly as our Secretary of Homeland Security. He's going to be amazing. Tomorrow I will swear in General James Mattis as our new Secretary of Defense. These men have devoted their lives to defending America, and now I look forward to working with them, along with our great new head of the CSA. We have so many different people that we are putting in office. I think it's the group of all-stars like really nobody has seen before, right? Where is? Where is Pompeo? Where the hell is he? [Laughter] Did he ever come here?\nAudience member. He's at work. He's working.\nThe President. Oh, he's working. He is so—he is going to be another one of the big stars. I have to mention him every single time. He's going to be great. One of you.\nAnd with you in Congress to keep our country safe from the many threats we face today—that includes protecting Americans from radical Islamic terrorism.\nWe also need to keep the ballot box safe from illegal voting. And believe me, you take a look at what's registering, folks. They like to say, oh, Trump, Trump, Trump. Take a look at what's registering. We are going to protect the integrity of the ballot box, and we are going to defend the votes of the American citizens. So important.\nAll of us are here today for the same reason: to serve the citizens of our country. We are not here for ourselves, we are here for them. We are here for the people. We are blessed by divinity and honored by history with the task of preserving this great republic and expanding its blessings to every single American. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. All of us are joined in this effort. All of us are bound by duty and bound by God, to give our full devotion to this country and its people. That obligation forms the moral foundation of our agenda. That agenda includes a lean, efficient Government; appointing Supreme Court Justices—so important—who will uphold and defend our Constitution; reducing taxation and regulation; fair trade that creates a level playing field, as opposed to what we have right now; and fostering respect for our country and its flag.\nWe are now only at the beginning of this incredible journey together. I am honored to be your partner in this amazing quest. I am privileged to stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, as we work every single day to make America great again.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America. It's a great honor to be here. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-26", "title": "Remarks at the \"Congress of Tomorrow\" Republican Member Retreat in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}

Our President is a man with broad shoulders and a big heart. His vision, his energy, and his optimism are boundless, and I know he will Make America Great Again.\nFrom his first day in office, he has been keeping his promises to the American people.\nAnd at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we're in the promise-keeping business.\nThat's why, on Monday President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy to prevent foreign aid from funding organizations that promote or perform abortions.\nThat's why this administration will work with Congress to end taxpayer funding for abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health-care services for women across America.\nAnd that's why, next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.\nLife is winning in America. And today is a celebration of the progress that we have made in the cause.\nYou know, I have long believed that a society can be judged by how we care for our most vulnerable – the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.\nWe've come to a historic moment in the cause of life, and we must meet this moment with respect and compassion for every American.\nLife is winning in America for many reasons.\nLife is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins.\nLife is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and homes to children in need.\nLife is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who minister to women, in cities and towns across this country.\nAnd life is winning through the quiet counsels between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables, and over coffee on college campuses the truth is being told and compassion is overcoming convenience, hope is defeating despair.\nIn a word, life is winning in America because of all of you.\nSo I urge you to press on.\nBut as it is written, \"let your gentleness be evident to all.\" Let this movement be known for love, not anger – for compassion, not confrontation. When it comes to matters of the heart, there's nothing stronger than gentleness.\nI believe we will continue to win the hearts and the minds of the rising generation if our hearts first break for young mothers and their unborn children and we do all we can to meet them where they are, with generosity, not judgment.\nTo heal our land and restore a culture of life we must continue to be a movement that embraces all and cares for all out of respect for the dignity and worth of every person.\nEnshrined on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial are the words of our third president, who admonished us to remember that \"God who gave us life gave us liberty.\"\nOn behalf of the President of the United States, and my little family, we thank you for your stand for life, for your compassion, for your love for the women and children of this nation.\nBe assured, we will not grow weary. We will not rest until we restore a culture of life for ourselves and our posterity.\nGod Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-27", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the March for Life"}

In his remarks, the President referred to Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization, also known as Daesh. Prime Minister May referred to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122543", "text": "President Trump. Thank you very much. I am honored to have Prime Minister Theresa May here for our first official visit from a foreign leader. This is our first visit, so—great honor.\nThe special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace. And by the way, my mother was born in Scotland—Stornoway—which is serious Scotland. [Laughter]\nToday the United States renews our deep bond with Britain: military, financial, cultural, and political. We have one of the great bonds. We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship. Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law. That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination. A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.\nBoth America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.\nMadam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business, and foreign affairs. Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.\nOn behalf of our Nation, I thank you for joining us here today. It's a really great honor. Thank you very much.\nPrime Minister May. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And can I start by saying that I'm so pleased that I've been able to be here today. And thank you for inviting me so soon after your Inauguration. And may—and I'm delighted to be able to congratulate you on what was a stunning election victory.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nPrime Minister May. And, as you say, the invitation is an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries, a relationship based on the bonds of history, of family, kinship, and common interests. And in a further sign of the importance of that relationship, I have today been able to convey Her Majesty the Queen's hope that President Trump and the First Lady would pay a state visit to the United Kingdom later this year. And I'm delighted that the President has accepted that invitation.\nNow, today we're discussing a number of topics, and there's much on which we agree. The President has mentioned foreign policy. We are discussing how we can work even more closely together in order to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamist extremism wherever it's found.\nOur two nations are already leading efforts to face up to this challenge, and we're making progress with Daesh losing territory and fighters, but we need to redouble our efforts. And today we are discussing how we can do this by deepening intelligence and security cooperation and, critically, by stepping up our efforts to counter Daesh in cyberspace. Because we know we will not eradicate this threat until we defeat the idea—the ideology that lies behind it.\nOur talks will be continuing later. I'm sure we'll discuss other topics, Syria and Russia.\nOn defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense. And today we've reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance. Mr. President, I think you said—you confirmed that you're a hundred percent behind NATO. But we're also discussing the importance of NATO continuing to ensure it is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyberwarfare as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.\nAnd I've agreed to continue my efforts to encourage my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitments to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense so that the burden is more fairly shared. It's only by investing properly in our defense that we can ensure we're properly equipped to face our shared challenges together.\nAnd finally, the President and I have mentioned future economic cooperation and trade. Trade between our two countries is already worth over 150 billion pounds a year. The U.S. is the single biggest source of inward investment to the U.K., and together, we've around $1 trillion invested in each other's economies. And the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship is the broadest, deepest, and most advanced of any two countries sharing military hardware and expertise. And I think the President and I are ambitious to build on this relationship in order to grow our respective economies, provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the U.K.\nAnd so we are discussing how we can establish a trade negotiation agreement, take forward immediate high-level talks, lay the groundwork for a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, and identify the practical steps we can take now in order to enable companies in both countries to trade and do business with one another more easily.\nAnd I'm convinced that a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. is in the national interest of both countries and will cement the crucial relationship that exists between us, particularly as the U.K. leaves the European Union and reaches out to the world.\nToday's talks, I think, are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship. And I look forward to continuing to work with you as we deliver on the promises of freedom and prosperity for all the people of our respective countries. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. That's very nicely stated. Steve Holland [Reuters]. Where's Steve? Steve—yes.\nRussia-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you. You're going to be speaking tomorrow with the Russian President.\nPresident Trump. Yes\nQ. What message would you like to convey to him? How close are you to lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Russia over its Ukraine incursion? What would you expect in return? And Prime Minister May, do you foresee any changes in British attitudes towards sanctions on Russia?\nPresident Trump. Well, I hear a call was set up, Steve, and we'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. That won't necessarily happen, unfortunately, it probably won't happen with many countries, but if we can have, as we do with Prime Minister May and the relationship that we've all developed, and even in the short relationship that we've just developed just by being with each other—we're going to have lunch, and we've really had some very interesting talks and very productive talks—but if we can have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I'm all for that. That would be a tremendous asset. No guarantees, but if we can, that would be a positive, not a negative. Okay?\nPrime Minister May. We have—as far as the U.K. is concerned on sanctions for Russia in relation to their activities in the Ukraine—we have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk agreement fully implemented. We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk agreement fully implemented, and we've been continuing to argue that inside the European Union. Okay?\nLaura.\nTorture/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Russia-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Prime Minister, you've talked about where you agree, but you have also said you would be frank where you disagree with the President. Can you tell us where in our talks you did disagree? And do you think that the President listened to what you had to say? And Mr. President——\nPresident Trump. Absolutely. [Laughter]\nQ. We'll see what she says. [Laughter] Mr. President, you've said before that torture works, you've praised Russia, you've said you want to ban some Muslims for coming—from coming to America, you've suggested there should be punishment for abortion. For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?\nPresident Trump. This was your choice of a question? [Laughter]\nPrime Minister May. [Inaudible]—start off, yes. [Laughter]\nPresident Trump. There goes that relationship. [Laughter]\nPrime Minister May. On the issue that you raised with me, Laura, can I confirm that the President—I've been listening to the President, and the President has been listening to me. That's the point of having a conversation and a dialogue. And we have been discussing a number of topics. We'll carry on after this press conference, meeting and, kind of, discussing a number of other topics. And there will be times when we disagree and issues on which we disagree. The point of the special relationship is that we are able to have that open and frank discussion so that we are able to make that clear when it happens.\nBut I'm clear also that there are many issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States stand alongside one another, many issues on which we agree. And I think, as I said yesterday in my speech, that we are at a moment now when we can build an even stronger special relationship which will be in the interest not just of the U.K. and the United States, but actually in the interests of the wider world as well.\nPresident Trump. Very good. We have a great general who has just been appointed Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, and he has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. Enhanced interrogation, I guess, would be a word that a lot of—words that a lot of people would like to use. I don't necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override, because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert. He's highly respected. He's the general's general—got through the Senate very, very quickly, which in this country is not easy, I will tell you. [Laughter] And so I'm going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. I've been open about that for a long period of time, but I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win with or without, but I do disagree.\nAs far as, again, Putin and Russia, I don't say good, bad, or indifferent. I don't know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully. And if we have a great relationship with Russia and other countries, and if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped—that's an evil that has to be stopped—I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.\nHow the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people, and I don't like them at all. [Laughter] And I've had some where I didn't think I was going to have much of a relationship, and it turned out to be a great relationship. So, Theresa, we never know about those things, do we? [Laughter] But I will tell you one thing, I'll be representing the American people very strongly. Thank you.\nHow about John Roberts, Fox.\nThe President's Phone Conversation With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico/Mexico-U.S. Relations\nQ. Mr. President, thank you so much. Madam Prime Minister.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nQ. It's my understanding, Mr. President, that you had an hour-long phone call this morning with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. Could we get an update on where the relationship is? Further to that, what do you say to your critics who claim that you have already soured a relationship with a very important U.S. ally? And Madam Prime Minister, if I may ask you as well, are you concerned about the state of relations between the United States and Mexico? Sir.\nPresident Trump. Well, I think the Prime Minister, first of all, has other things that she's much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship. But I will say that we had a very good call. I have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I work with the Mexican people all the time, great relationships. But as you know, Mexico—with the United States—has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I'm not going to let that happen. And General Kelly is going to do a fantastic job at Homeland Security. As you know, we swore him in yesterday.\nWe have a really, I think, a very good relationship, the President and I, and we had a talk that lasted for about an hour this morning. And we are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship. But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies, and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won't happen with me. We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing. And so we are going to renegotiate our trade deals, and we are going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico. And in the end, I think it will be good for both countries.\nBut it was a very, very friendly call. I think you'll hear that from the President, and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico that really represent him and represent him very well. And I look forward to—over the coming months we'll be negotiating, and we'll see what happens. But I'm representing the people of the United States, and I'm going to represent them as somebody should represent them, not how they've been represented in the past, where we lose to every single country.\nPrime Minister May. As the President himself has said, the relationship of the United States with Mexico is a matter for the United States and Mexico.\nTom [Tom N. Dunn, Sun].\nThe President's Relationship With Prime Minister May/United Kingdom Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union\nQ. Mr. President, you've said you would help us with a Brexit trade deal. You said you'd stand by us with NATO, but how can the British Prime Minister believe you, because you have been known in the past to change your position on things? And also, may I ask a question to both of you? People are fascinated to know how you're going to get on with each other. You're so different: the hard-working daughter of a vicar, the brash TV extrovert. Have you found anything in common personally yet?\nPresident Trump. Actually, I'm not as brash as you might think. [Laughter] And I can tell you that I think we're going to get along very well. You know, I've—interesting because I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa. And I can often tell how I get along with somebody very early, and I believe we're going to have a fantastic relationship.\nBrexit—and I really don't change my position very much. If you go back and you look, my position on trade has been solid for many, many years, since I was a very young person talking about how we were getting ripped off by the rest of the world. Now, I never knew I'd be in this position where we can actually do something about it. But we will be talking to your folks about Brexit. Brexit was an example of what was to come, and I happened to be in Scotland at Turnberry cutting a ribbon when Brexit happened. And we had a vast amount of press there. And I said Brexit—this was the day before, you probably remember—I said Brexit is going to happen. And I was scorned in the press for making that prediction. I was scorned. And I said I believe it's going to happen, because people want to know who's coming into their country, and they want to control their own trade and various other things. And lo and behold, the following day, it happened. And the odds weren't looking good for me when I made that statement, because as you know, everybody thought it was not going to happen.\nI think Brexit's going to be a wonderful thing for your country. I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you're going to have the people that you want in your country, and you're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you're doing. And I had a very bad experience. I have—I had something when I was in my other world. I have something in another country, and getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. Getting the approvals from the country was fast, easy, and efficient. Getting the approvals from the group—I call them the consortium—was very, very tough. But I thought Brexit—I think and I think it'll go down that it will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom. I think in the end it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability. Okay. Prime Minister. And just on the question you asked me, Tom. I mean, I think as the President himself has said, I think we have already struck up a good relationship. But you asked what we had in common. I think if you look at the approach that we're both taking, I think one of the things that we have in common is that we want to put the interests of ordinary working people right up there, center stage. Those people who, you know, they're working all the hours, they're doing their best for their families, and sometimes, they just feel the odds are stacked against them. And it's that interest in ensuring that what we do, that the economies—our economies and our governments actually work for ordinary working people—work for everyone in our countries. I think we both share that.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much.\nPrime Minister May. Thank you.\nPresident Trump.

Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States.

And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\nNumerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \"honor\" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\nSec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.\n(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).\n(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.\n(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.\n(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.\n(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.\n(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.\nSec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the\nUnited States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.\nSec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.\n(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.\n(e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest—including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship—and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.\n(f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n(g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\nSec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.\nSec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\nSec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.\n(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected. Sec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.\nSec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:\n(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;\n(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\n(b) The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.\nSec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Mattis made remarks, concluding as follows.]\nSec. Mattis. It's a reminder that this department stands in perpetuity as the defender, as the sentinels, and as the guardians of the Nation. And thank you for your confidence in me, Mr. President.\nThe President. Total confidence. Thank you very much.\nSec. Mattis. Sure.\nThe President. Thank you, General. And that's total confidence, believe me.\nI'd like to first congratulate General James Mattis, now Secretary Mattis. Secretary Mattis has devoted his life to serving his country. He is a man of honor, a man of devotion, and a man of total action. He likes action. He is the right man at the right time, and he will do us all very, very proud.\nI am honored to stand here today among so many patriots. You are the backbone of this country. You are the spirit of this Nation in every sense. The men and women of the United States military are the greatest force for justice and peace and goodness that have ever walked the face of this Earth. Your legacy exists everywhere in the world today where people are more free, more prosperous, and more secure because of the United States of America. And you have earned and ensured for our children the glorious birthright of freedom bestowed upon us by God.\nWe stand today in the Hall of Heroes—great heroes—a testament to the undying courage of those who wear our Nation's uniform and who have received the highest distinction: the Medal of Honor. This is a sacred hall. The soul of our Nation lives between these walls.\nThese walls tell the story of those intrepid Americans who gave everything, risked everything, and fought with everything they had to save their fellow warriors—and warriors they are, believe me, warriors they are—and to save our wondrous liberties and to save this God-blessed land. They shed their blood and poured out the love from their hearts to protect our home. We are in awe of their valor—tremendous valor—and we pledge our dedication to every single family serving our country and our flag.\nThat is why today I am signing two executive actions to ensure the sacrifices of our military are supported by the actions of our Government. And they will always be supported by the actions of our Government, believe me.\nFirst, I am signing an executive action to begin a great rebuilding of the Armed Services of the United States, developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources, and new tools for our men and women in uniform. And I'm very proud to be doing that as we prepare our budget request for Congress. And I think Congress is going to be very happy to see it. Our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will our dedication to peace. We do want peace.\nSecondly, I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don't want them here. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love, deeply, our people.\nWe will never forget the lessons of 9/11, nor the heroes who lost their lives at the Pentagon. They were the best of us. We will honor them not only with our words, but with our actions. And that's what we're doing today.\nI am privileged to be here with you. And I promise that our administration will always have your back. We will always be with you. And I just want to thank you very much.\nI want to just extend a very special congratulations to a great man, and that's Secretary Mattis. And I think he's going to lead us so brilliantly. He's a tremendous soldier, always has been. He's a general's general. Every general that I spoke to, they just—I won't say that they all said \"He's our favorite,\" but they did. [Laughter] He's our favorite. He's a special, special man.\nSo I want to bless him. And God bless you and God bless America. And, Secretary Mattis, I have no doubt you're going to do an outstanding job. And thank you very much for accepting this responsibility. Thank you.\nSec. Mattis. Thank you, Mr. President.\n[The President sat at the signing table.]\nThe President. Okay, so this is the rebuilding of the United States Armed Forces. That's a big one.\nAnd Secretary, it's nice to see you. Both of you. Thank you very much. Great job.\nThat's a big statement, isn't it? The rebuilding. Doesn't that sound good? It's been a while. It's been a long time. Too long.\n[The President signed the memorandum.]\nWho do we give this pen to? What do you think? Secretary Mattis, I thought.\n[The President gave the memorandum to Vice President Michael R. Pence.]\nThank you, Mike.\nAnd this is the protection of the Nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means. Protection of the Nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. That's big stuff.\n[The President signed the Executive order.]\nAnd I want to thank everybody in this room. Many great heroes, many great warriors. We have tremendous respect for you all. Thank you for being here. Joe, thank you very much. Appreciate it.

My message was clear: We want to make things in America, and we want to use American workers. Since my election, many companies have announced they are no longer moving jobs out of our country, but are instead keeping and creating jobs right here in America.\nEvery day, we are fulfilling the promise we made to the American people. Here are just a few of the executive actions that I have taken in the last few days: an order to prepare for repealing and replacing Obamacare—it's about time; the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that we can negotiate one-on-one deals that protect American workers—that would have been a disastrous deal for our workers; an order to begin construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, following a renegotiation of terms, with the requirement that pipelines installed in America be built with American steel and manufactured here; a directive to expedite permits for new infrastructure and new manufacturing plants; an order to immediately begin the border wall and to crack down on sanctuary cities.

In addition to abiding by the limitations of paragraphs 1 and 2, I also agree, upon leaving Government service, not to engage in lobbying activities with respect to any covered executive branch official or non-career Senior Executive Service appointee for the remainder of the Administration.\n\"4. I will not, at any time after the termination of my employment in the United States Government, engage in any activity on behalf of any foreign government or foreign political party which, were it undertaken on January 20, 2017, would require me to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended.\n\"5. I will not accept gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying organizations for the duration of my service as an appointee.\n\"6. I will not for a period of 2 years from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.\n\"7. If I was a registered lobbyist within the 2 years before the date of my appointment, in addition to abiding by the limitations of paragraph 6, I will not for a period of 2 years after the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter on which I lobbied within the 2 years before the date of my appointment or participate in the specific issue area in which that particular matter falls.\n\"8. I agree that any hiring or other employment decisions I make will be based on the candidate's qualifications, competence, and experience.\n\"9. I acknowledge that the Executive Order entitled 'Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees,' issued by the President on January 28, 2017, which I have read before signing this document, defines certain terms applicable to the foregoing obligations and sets forth the methods for enforcing them.

In order to advise and assist me in executing this solemn responsibility, as well as to protect and advance the national interests of the United States at home and abroad, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development and decision-making shall be organized as follows:\nA. The National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Supporting Staff\nThe National Security Act of 1947, as amended, established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security. There is also a Homeland Security Council (HSC)—established through Executive Order 13228 of October 8, 2001, and subsequently codified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002—that has the purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security. Each Council is also responsible for the effective coordination of the security-related activities and functions of the executive departments and agencies.\nThe security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries. Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative. Both Councils are statutory bodies that the President will continue to chair. Invitations to participate in specific Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue or issues under consideration. When the President is absent from a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President's direction.\nThe Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (Homeland Security Advisor) shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President's direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC or HSC, respectively, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared, and recording Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner. When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy shall perform these tasks in concert.\nThe NSC and HSC shall have as their regular attendees (both statutory and non-statutory) the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations. When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the NSC's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings. The Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are invited as attendees to any NSC meeting.\nIn addition to the NSC and HSC, there is also a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President that serves both the NSC and HSC. The staff is composed of regional, issue-focused, and functional directorates and headed by a single civilian Executive Secretary, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 3021, who is also the Chief of Staff. All policy and staff activity decisions will be transmitted to the Executive Secretary for appropriate distribution and awareness. The purpose of the NSC staff is to advise me, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, the NSC members, the HSC members, and others in the White House; to facilitate the implementation of Administration policy; and to help coordinate the national-security-related activities of the executive departments and agencies.\nB. The Principals Committee\nThe Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States. The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor or the Homeland Security Advisor, as appropriate, in consultation with the appropriate attendees of the PC. The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the appropriate committee members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner. Invitations to participate in or attend a specific PC shall be extended at the discretion of the National Security Advisor and the Homeland Security Advisor, and may include those Cabinet-level heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue under consideration. The PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the National Security Advisor, and the Homeland Security Advisor. The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. The Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all PC meetings.\nThe Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor (Deputy National Security Advisor), the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the Executive Secretary (who shall serve as the Executive Secretary of the PC) shall attend all of the meetings of the PC, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations and the Assistant to the President for Intragovernmental and Technology Initiatives may attend as appropriate.\nWhen international economic issues are on the agenda of the PC, the Committee's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (who shall serve as Chair for agenda items that principally pertain to international economics).\nC. The Deputies Committee\nThe Deputies Committee (DC) shall continue to serve as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of, and where appropriate, decision-making on, policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States. The DC shall be convened and chaired by the Deputy National Security Advisor or the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor (Deputy Homeland Security Advisor), as appropriate. The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the regular DC members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner. Invitations to participate in or attend a specific DC meeting shall be extended by the Chair to those at the Deputy or Under Secretary level of executive departments and agencies, and to other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue under consideration.\nThe DC shall have as its regular members the Deputy Secretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Attorney General, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, the Deputy National Security Advisor, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.\nThe Executive Secretary shall attend the DC meetings. The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs may attend all DC meetings. The relevant Deputy Assistant to the President for the specific regional and functional issue under consideration shall also be invited to attend. Likewise, when and where appropriate, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communication, the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Transnational Issues, and the Deputy Representative of the United States to the United Nations, shall also be invited to attend. Other senior officials shall be invited where appropriate.\nThe DC shall review and monitor the work of the interagency national security process, including the interagency groups established pursuant to section D below. The DC shall help to ensure that issues brought before the NSC, HSC, and PC have been properly analyzed and prepared for decision. The DC shall also focus significant attention on monitoring the implementation of policies and decisions and shall conduct periodic reviews of the Administration's major national security and foreign policy initiatives. The DC is responsible for establishing Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) and for providing objectives and clear guidance.\nD. Policy Coordination Committees\nManagement of the development and implementation of national security policies by multiple executive departments and agencies typically shall be accomplished by the PCCs, with participation primarily occurring at the Assistant Secretary level. As the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordination of national security policies, the PCCs shall provide policy analysis for consideration by the more senior committees of the national security system and ensure timely responses to the President's decisions.\nRegional and issue-related PCCs shall be established at the direction of the DC. Members of the NSC staff (or National Economic Council staff, as appropriate) will chair the PCCs; the DC, at its discretion, may add co-chairs to any PCC. The PCCs shall review and coordinate the implementation of Presidential decisions in their respective policy areas. The Chair of each PCC, in consultation with the Executive Secretary, shall invite representatives of other executive departments and agencies to attend meetings of the PCC where appropriate. The Chair of each PCC, with the agreement of the Executive Secretary, may establish subordinate working groups to assist that PCC in the performance of its duties.\nAn early meeting of the DC will be devoted to establishing the PCCs, determining their memberships, and providing them with mandates and strict guidance. Until the DC has established otherwise, the existing system of Interagency Policy Committees shall continue.\nE. General\nThe President and the Vice President may attend any and all meetings of any entity established by or under this memorandum.\nThis document is part of a series of National Security Presidential Memoranda that shall replace both Presidential Policy Directives and Presidential Study Directives as the instrument for communicating relevant Presidential decisions. This memorandum shall supersede all other existing Presidential guidance on the organization or support of the NSC and the HSC. With regard to its application to economic matters, this document shall be interpreted in concert with any Executive Order governing the National Economic Council and with Presidential Memoranda signed hereafter that implement either this memorandum or that Executive Order.\nThe Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a \"caliphate.\" But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it. For those reasons I am directing my Administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS.\nISIS is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle East, including the beheadings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig, as well as the death of Kayla Mueller. In addition, ISIS has inspired attacks in the United States, including the December 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, and the June 2016 attack in Orlando, Florida. ISIS is complicit in a number of terrorist attacks on our allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the November 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, the July 2016 attack in Nice, France, and the December 2016 attack in Berlin, Germany.\nISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. If ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow. We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability. It continues to radicalize our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount. The United States must take decisive action to defeat ISIS.\nSec. 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States that ISIS be defeated.\nSec. 2. Policy Coordination. Policy coordination, guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic in-progress reviews for the functions and programs described and assigned in this memorandum shall be provided through the interagency process established in National Security Presidential Memorandum-2 of January 28, 2017 (Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council), or any successor.\nSec. 3. Plan to Defeat ISIS. (a) Scope and Timing.\n(i) Development of a new plan to defeat ISIS (the Plan) shall commence immediately.\n(ii) Within 30 days, a preliminary draft of the Plan to defeat ISIS shall be submitted to the President by the Secretary of Defense.\n(iii) The Plan shall include: (A) a comprehensive strategy and plans for the defeat of ISIS;\n(B) recommended changes to any United States rules of engagement and other United States policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against ISIS;\n(C) public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimize ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology;\n(D) identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates;\n(E) mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS's financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources; and\n(F) a detailed strategy to robustly fund the Plan.\n(b) Participants. The Secretary of Defense shall develop the Plan in collaboration with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\n(c) Development of the Plan. Consistent with applicable law, the Participants identified in subsection (b) of this section shall compile all information in the possession of the Federal Government relevant to the defeat of ISIS and its affiliates. All executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly comply with any request of the Participants to provide information in their possession or control pertaining to ISIS. The Participants may seek further information relevant to the Plan from any appropriate source.\n(d) The Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

And we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\nThank you, everybody.

I think it's one of these things that-- and if you ask a lot of the people at the customs and border patrol would just tell you you've got to just rip off the Band-Aid and you have to move forward. It wasn't chaos. The fact of the matter is 325,000 people from foreign countries came into the United States yesterday and 109 people were detained for further questioning. Most of those people were moved out. We've got a couple dozen more that remain, and I would suspect as long as they're not awful people that they will move through before another half a day today and perhaps some of these people should be detained further, and if they're folks that shouldn't be in this country they're going to be detained. So apologize for nothing here.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer On ABC's \"This Week\": We Must \"Ensure That The People That We're Letting Into Our Country Are Coming Here With Peaceful Purposes And Not To Do Us Harm.\"\nSPICER: \"Let's look at the facts of what happened. There's 325,000 people from foreign countries that traveled into the United States yesterday. There were 109 people that this (Executive Order) actually addressed, that had come in post-entry from seven countries that we've identified. In fact, actually, the Obama Administration had previously identified (those seven countries) needed further travel restrictions. We've gone in, as Terry pointed out, it's a 90-day ban to ensure that we have further vetting restrictions so that we know who is coming to this country. The safety of the American citizens, the safety of our country has got to be paramount. And that's what the President did yesterday, is to ensure that the people that we're letting into our country are coming here with peaceful purposes and not to do us harm. So this really comes down to 109 people who are all being processed through the system to make sure that when they've gone out of the country, gone somewhere that is one of those seven countries and coming back, that they've done so and not tried to go there and do anything that would cause our nation harm.\"\nOn The President Keeping His Promises\nConway On Fox's \"Fox News Sunday\": \"There's A Fundamental Fairness That Donald Trump Ran, Won On And Will Execute\" On.\nCONWAY: \"There's a fundamental fairness that Donald Trump ran, won on and will execute as President of the United States.

The seven countries named in the Executive order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\nTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion; this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.

Purpose. It is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, from both public and private sources. In addition to the management of the direct expenditure of taxpayer dollars through the budgeting process, it is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations. Toward that end, it is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\nSec. 2. Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.\n(b) For fiscal year 2017, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director).\n(c) In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations. Any agency eliminating existing costs associated with prior regulations under this subsection shall do so in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law.\n(d) The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section. Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section. The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements.\nSec. 3. Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget. (a) Beginning with the Regulatory Plans (required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, or any successor order) for fiscal year 2018, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the head of each agency shall identify, for each regulation that increases incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 2(c) of this order, and provide the agency's best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.\n(b) Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order.\n(c) Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included on the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director.\n(d) During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for the next fiscal year. No regulations exceeding the agency's total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director. The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost.\n(e) The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section.\nSec. 4. Definition. For purposes of this order the term \"regulation\" or \"rule\" means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, but does not include:\n(a) regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, or foreign affairs function of the United States;\n(b) regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or\n(c) any other category of regulations exempted by the Director.\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Who's back here? My friends, my geniuses. [Laughter] This one just paid—for the press—hundreds of millions of dollars in tax to get paid, like, $100,000 a year or something, which he gave up too. Right?\nPresident of Goldman Sachs paid close to $200 million in tax, and he didn't do that to make $200,000, which he, by the way, gave up. Did you give the money up? I shouldn't ask you that. That's terrible. [Laughter]\nNational Economic Council Director Gary D. Cohn. Oh, yes.\nThe President. Anyway, that's a great.\nDirector Cohn. Yes, I gave up my salary. [Laughter]\nParticipant. Thank you.\nThe President. He's a brilliant guy, and we appreciate it. We appreciate what you've done.\nDirector Cohn. Thank you.\nThe President. Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, formerly. That was a big check he had to write. [Laughter] Sit down, please. Stinks to have to write a check like that, right? Right, Chris? [Laughter]\nWell, I want to thank you all very much. Linda McMahon, as you know, is the director. She's a fantastic woman, and—fantastic woman. And we're waiting for her approval; we're waiting for many approvals from the Senate. The Democrats are acting deliberately slow. They're not behaving well at all. And that's why over the last many years nothing got done in this country. But we're moving things along, and we're moving them along fast.\nWe actually had a very good day yesterday in terms of homeland security. And someday, we had to make the move, and we decided to make the move. It would be nice again if we could have our Cabinet, because our Cabinet, which is outstanding, is going through a lot in terms of what they're being put through in the Senate. Jeff Sessions, they made him wait an extra week, and they did that only for political reasons. It was only for—they just made him wait—I'd say, why did they do that? Just politics.\nI noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with fake tears. I'm going to ask him, who is his acting coach? [Laughter] Because I know him very well. I don't see him as a crier. If he is, he's a different man. There's about a 5 percent chance that it was real, but I think they were fake tears.\nWe have a big decision and—that I have made, a very big decision on the United States Supreme Court that is going to be announced tomorrow night from the White House at 8 o'clock, a person who is unbelievably highly respected. And I think you will be very impressed with this person. So that will be 8 o'clock tomorrow night at the White House—from the White House. And today we have with us people who are very successful in the world of small business. And I love small business. I started as a small business. My business got big. And I've dealt with the small businesses and the big businesses, and I love you all the same.\nThe big business folks have been fantastic. They're bringing jobs back. I say, where was the outrage of the Democrats when all of our companies were fleeing to Mexico and to other places far away and leaving jobs behind? Now they're all coming back. They're coming back by big numbers, bigger numbers than people have seen.\nYou saw Ford is announcing and has announced big plants coming back into Michigan and Ohio and different places. General Motors has made big announcements. Fiat Chrysler, the head, Sergio, flew all the way from Italy just to make our meeting last week. You look at what's happening with Lockheed; number one, we're cutting the price of their planes by a lot, but they're also expanding, and that's going to be a good thing. Ultimately, they're going to cut—they're going to be better off. Boeing also is very much involved in new hirings and also coming in with good pricing.\nSo we're cutting pricing; we all know about that. The people at this table know about that. You could have done that. But we cut approximately $600 million off the F-35 fighter, and that only amounts to 90 planes out of close to 3,000 planes. And when you think about $600 million that was announced by Marilynn, who's very talented—the head of Lockheed Martin—I got involved in that about a month ago. A lot was put out. And when they say \"a lot,\" a lot meant about 90 planes. They were having a lot of difficulty. There was no movement. And I was able to get $600 million, approximately, off those planes. So I think that was a great achievement. But that really means much more than that if you think about the fact that that's 90 planes out of close to 3,000 planes that are being ordered.\nSo I appreciate Lockheed Martin for being so responsive. And that will be appreciated very much. I appreciate Boeing for coming in and competing, and now they'll be competing during the process for the rest of the planes, because there are thousands of more planes coming. We have a lot of planes coming. These are contracts that everybody knows about. The F-35 fighter jet, a great plane, by the way, I have to tell you. And Lockheed is doing a very good job as of now. There were great delays, about 7 years of delays, tremendous cost overruns. We've ended all of that. And we've got that program really, really now in good shape, so I'm very proud of that.\nI actually started working on that before, when I was President-elect. And the reason I was working on it—and you folks would understand it—because we love doing that stuff, right? [Laughter]\nCapitol Radiology Owner Larry N. McKenney. Absolutely.\nThe President. Somebody said, why don't you take a vacation before you become President? I said, because I like doing this.\nBut we're saving—we will be saving billions and billions and billions of dollars on contracts.\nAs you know, we approved the pipelines, but as I'm sitting there and looking at the approval, I said where is this pipe made? These are massive pipes, bigger than this room. And a lot of it is made in other countries, including China. And I said, you mean you can make pipe in China and other places far away, ship it to the United States on massive boats, put it on trucks, and deliver it to the middle of the country, and we can't make it cheaper? Right. Mr. McKenney. It makes no sense.\nThe President. I'm saying, what are we talking about here? So—and these are big pipes. Now, the only way I can imagine they do that is, they must have to cut them because they're so big. I can't imagine—they take up so much room, I can't imagine you could put that much pipe on ships. It's too—it's not enough; it's not long enough. So I assume they have to fabricate and cut, which hurts the pipe, by the way.\nSo I said to myself: If they're going to do the pipe in the United States, using the powers of the United States, including eminent domain—for those that used to criticize me about, \"oh, eminent domain.\" I said, did you every ride on a highway before? They used eminent domain. But if you remember, especially during the primaries, I was criticized about the use of eminent domain. Well, they need eminent domain to do pipelines. But if we're going to use our powers of eminent domain and all the other powers, then I want the pipe to be manufactured with United States steel. That doesn't mean the company United States Steel, it means steel from the United States. United States Steel will be, absolutely, a bidder. And I also want it to be fabricated in the United States.\nSo if we're doing these massive pipelines, I want workers in the United States to fabricate the pipe. And that, sort of, makes sense. Don't you think so as small-business owners? And so we're doing a lot of things, a lot of really great things. And we're very proud of it.\nThe small business is a big part of American economic success, although lately, there hasn't been too much success, because we're having our products made everywhere in the world so much. But we're bringing that all back. It's coming back. It's coming back fast. You see the difference already, right?\nJWA Construction Management President Joy A. Weatherup-Anthis. Absolutely.\nThe President. More than 28 million small businesses in the country—28 million. Small business equals fewer than 500 employees. That's what's considered a small business. Anybody have over 500 employees here? If you do, we're getting you the hell out here. [Laughter] Fifty-six million small business employees. Think of it, 56 million. Small business is really our biggest business. We employ 48 percent of private workforce. The private workforce, a big percentage is employed by small business.\nSo we read about General Motors and Ford and Boeing and Lockheed and all of these great companies, but a big percentage of them are small business. We want to make life easier for these small-business owners. That's what we're here for today.\nLast week, we had the big businesses. And this week coming we have the really, really big businesses set up by Steve Schwarzman, great Wall Street person, a man who's done a great job. We have some of the—we have the greatest businesses, they're set up, and that's happening very soon. But the small business, we are going to simplify—reduce, eliminate regulations. We're doing that for big business, too, by the way. There can't be any discrimination, right? But big businesses are thrilled what's happening. The stock market has gone up massively since the election. Everyone is saying, \"Oh, the market will go down.\" I said, the market is not going down. The smart people know me. The businesspeople know me. They know what I'm about. So the market went massively up. In fact, when I was elected, a lot of the really smart people went out and bought a lot of stock. And they've been rewarded.\nWe want to simplify and lower taxes, unless you'd rather have high taxes, right? [Laughter]\nMs. Weatherup-Anthis. No, thanks. The President. So small-business owners can spend more time and money finding and responding to customers and expanding markets. They have more money and more opportunities to hire more employees. So, essentially, we're getting rid of regulations to a massive extent. Could be as much as 75 percent, could be even slightly more than that. We're going to have great protection for the consumer. We have to. But we don't need 97 different rules to take care of one element. Their individual economic success will support American success.\nWe want to end the unfairness between small and big business caused by regulation. Regulation has actually been horrible for big business, but it's been worse for small business. Plus, small business can't hire the kind of talent that the big businesses can hire, so it's really very unfair. Big business so often can afford compliance with the costly new regulations, but I don't want them to. I want them to build new plants and sell more cars. We're going to be doing tremendous favors. If you saw the head of Ford and the head of General Motors leaving here last week, they couldn't believe—one of them said, one of the greatest meetings we've ever attended.\nThe unions were here last week—the workers—representing workers, whether it's union or not. They said it was the single greatest meeting they've ever had. That was a nice statement. I didn't tell them to say that, but it was a nice statement. [Laughter] But I understand what they mean.\nIt's unfair to small business. Small business has been treated very, very badly. As you people know better than anybody, it's almost impossible now to start a small business, and it's virtually impossible to expand your existing business because of regulations——\nMs. Weatherup-Anthis. That's right.\nThe President. ——and because if the banks don't loan you money. Dodd-Frank is a disaster. We're going to be doing a big number on Dodd-Frank. So that's one big reason why I'm taking this action, and I'll be taking an action later this morning—and if you'd like, you can join me at the signing—to begin our effort to dramatically reduce Federal regulations. And we'll be reducing them, big league, and their damaging effects on our small businesses, our economy, our entrepreneurial spirit. And it's been very badly damaged.\nSo the American Dream is back. We're going to create an environment for small business like we haven't had in many, many decades. This isn't a knock on a President Obama, this is a knock on many Presidents preceding me. This is a knock on everybody. It got particularly bad in the last 8 years. But it's not a knock on anybody, it's a knock on many.\nSo I just want to thank you all for being here. And now let's talk.\nQ. Sir, what did you think of the protests yesterday and the legal challenges to your Executive order?", "timestamp": "2017-01-30", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting With Small-Business Owners"}

Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch comes after a selection process marked by an unprecedented level of transparency and involvement by the American voters.\n\"I am proud to announce the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for Justice of the Supreme Court,\" President Trump said. \"This has been the most transparent and most important Supreme Court selection process in the history of our country and I wanted the American people to have a voice in this nomination. Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text. He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.\"\nJudge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado. He attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After graduating with honors, he received his doctorate from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. Judge Gorsuch clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Following a successful career in private practice, Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. In 2006, President George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed by voice vote without objection. He has served with distinction, earning a reputation as a brilliant jurist with an outstanding intellect and a clear, incisive writing style, and he is universally respected for his integrity and fairness to all parties.\n\"I am honored and humbled to receive this nomination,\" said Judge Gorsuch. \"I look forward to meeting with Senators over the coming weeks as we begin this process.\"", "timestamp": "2017-01-31", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123150", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:09 P.M. EST\nGood afternoon. I know you're all looking forward to what promises to be a historic night for the nation and for this President. The President is very excited to make his announcement of the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court later this evening.\nAccording to some polls -- and you know we love polls around here -- for 70 percent of the voters, the President's choice for Supreme Court was an important factor in their choice at the ballot box in November. For more than one in five, it was the most important factor. Tonight, he will formally present his nominee to the American people, and I can assure you that this individual will make those voters and every American very, very proud.\nThis particular choice is one that the President takes very seriously. He knows it will impact the course of our country's jurisprudence for generations to come. As such, he's taken careful steps to ensure that this process has both been transparent and inclusive. He has been speaking about the list of individuals that he may nominate since May of this year, and, after consulting with several influential groups, released a definitive list of 21 in September, pledging that his nominee will solely come from that list. He sought the advice and consent of both Republicans and Democrats, senators throughout this process.\nThe President recognizes the gravity of his choice to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia, one of the most steadfast protectors of our liberty and devotees of our Constitution that ever graced the bench. Whomever the President selects will be a worthy successor to the brilliant legal mind and constitutional dedication of Justice Scalia.\nIt's our intention to start promptly tonight in the East Room at 8:02 p.m. Pre-set will begin at 6:30. The East Room will be available for live shots approximately 20 minutes following the announcement, and both the Briefing Room and Pebble Beach outside have extended hours tonight to accommodate any additional journalistic needs. We'll have further guidance on tonight's plans as the day evolves.\nMoving to the news of the day, I know that Secretary Kelly, alongside other DHS officials, just recently concluded a briefing on the operational implementation of the President's executive order. I think it's pretty clear from the Secretary's press conference that this executive order was enacted with the proper preparation and coordination between the White House and DHS, and that implementation will continue and proceed as planned.\nWe also have a few updates on the leadership of some of our most critical government agencies. Last night, as you know, the President relieved Sally Yates of her duties as acting Attorney General and named Dana Boente, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as the acting Attorney General until Democratic senators finally quit their obstruction and confirm the unquestionably qualified Senator Jeff Sessions as our next Attorney General.\nMs. Yates failed to enforce a legal order, approved by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and designed to protect the citizens of the United States. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven nations is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\nAround 9:00 p.m. last night, the President signed an affidavit of nomination for Mr. Boente. As one of his first official actions in his new post as acting Attorney General, he signed a memorandum rescinding Sally Yates' guidance regarding the President's executive order to ensure its full implementation.\nLast night, the President also announced the appointment of Thomas Homan as Acting Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Director of ICE. Mr. Homan has had a long career at ICE, most recently serving as the Executive Associate Director for Enforcement and Removal Operations. Having a professional in place like this go serve as the acting director is critical to ensuring the efficient administration of the President's agenda.\nOne other update on a story from yesterday. I hope you all saw the statement that was put out from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Chairman Dunford noted -- discussed the reorganization of the National Security Council. And he made it clear that he continues to fully participate in the interagency process and provide the best possible military advice to the President and members of the NSC. I really hope that that statement closes the book on the misleading narrative, and this should hopefully be the final time that we have to address what was in the national security directive.\nThe family of the President -- excuse me, the President also had a very somber and lengthy conversation with the family of [Navy] Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens. The President offered his sincerest condolences to Officer Owens's wife, his father, and their three children. Chief Owens was on his 12th deployment, from what I understand. We could never repay the debt of gratitude we owe him, the freedom that he fought for, and the sacrifice that he made, as well as the other members of his unit who were injured in this operation.\nToday in the Senate, two of the President's nominees advanced out of the committee. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of both Congressman Ryan Zinke as the next Interior Secretary and the nomination of former Texas Governor Rick Perry as the next Secretary of Energy. Elaine Chao also gratefully received the approval of the full Senate to become the next Secretary of Transportation. I expect further guidance on her official swearing-in to come very soon.\nThe Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the President continues to take decisive action, just like he promised. So it's unfortunate that Senate Democrats remain so out of touch with the message that the American people sent this past November -- that people want change. President Trump is delivering that change, and the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government.\nI know that I've repeated this every day, but honestly it's getting a bit ridiculous. The idea that these highly qualified nominees have the votes for their nominations to be endorsed out of committee and get a full vote are being stalled because Democrats are boycotting the committee vote is outrageous. The mere idea that they're not even showing up to hearings is truly outrageous. So I'd like to give a special shout-out to the folks at C-SPAN for making sure that all of these embarrassing actions by Senate Democrats get the wall-to-wall coverage that they deserve. Voters are going to remember what senators stood in the way of when President Trump -- by President Trump trying to install his agency and department leaders the next time their name is on a ballot.\nI don't mean to sound like a broken record, but the numbers don't lie. Sixteen of President Trump's nominees to head major department or agencies are still waiting to be confirmed. At the same time in 2009, President Obama only had seven of these people awaiting confirmation. In 2001, President Bush had all but two.\nMoving on, here at the White House, this morning, we reiterated the President's intention to continue to enforce the executive order protecting employees from the anti-LGBTQ discrimination while working for the federal government or contractors.\nAlso this morning, the President had a breakfast and listening session with major pharmaceutical company executives in the Roosevelt Room: Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene, Amgen, Eli Lilly, and the PhRMA trade group were represented at the meeting. Chairman Greg Walden, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, also participated. During the meeting, the President commended their progress in lowering drugs prices but also reiterated his insistence that there is more work to be done. He promised to continue reducing the burdensome regulations that raise the cost of doing business in America.\nHe was pleased to hear that the Chairman of Amgen, Robert Bradway, discussed how 1,600 American jobs will be added by Amgen. This administration will continue to prioritize jobs and make it easier for businesses around this country to hire more Americans.\nThe President had lunch with Mayor Giuliani just a short time ago, who serves as the CEO of an international security firm, Giuliani Partners, and was tapped by the President to lend his expertise to the administration's cyber efforts. Mayor Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his 15 years private sector security, providing solutions for the challenges that we face in the cyber world.\nDuring the transition, the President announced that he intended to host a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies that are facing challenges, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information from technological infrastructures. These are the same challenges facing the government that are facing public entities and businesses, and the President believes that solutions to these issues will often come from the private sector.\nFollowing the lunch with Mayor Giuliani, the President will host a listening session with these cybersecurity experts and Mayor Giuliani. No consensus or advice on the recommendations resulting from the group are wildly expected, but we do expect a spirited and wide-ranging discussion regarding the growing cybersecurity threats that our nation is facing.\nLater this afternoon, the President will sign an executive order -- or potentially sign one -- the federal government cybersecurity efforts, and give leaders the tools they need to keep the country safe from cyberattacks.\nThe order does three main things: It secures the federal networks we operate on behalf of the American people. It will work with industry to protect critical infrastructure and maintain our way of life. And it will advance the cause of Internet freedom.\nMore information will be available later this afternoon, but the executive order is the first step in the President taking to address the new security challenges of the 21st century.\nThe Vice President today participated in the Republican Policy lunch today in the Senate. He'll hold several meetings with members on Capitol Hill, the beginning of extensive outreach by our Legislative Affairs team on the President's Supreme Court choice.\nTonight, the Vice President will swear in Elaine Chao, as I mentioned. We'll have further updates. We expect it to be at 5 o'clock in the ceremonial office across the way, in the Old Executive Office Building.\nSecretary Chao is one of the most successful Cabinet officials in American history, having been the longest tenured Secretary of Labor since WWII, and also serving as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under George H.W. Bush's administration. She's the perfect choice to lead the Department of Transportation into what promises to be a significant period of modernization and improvement.\nAs I already mentioned, the last thing on our schedule for tonight is the President's announcement of the next Associate Justice for the Supreme Court.\nTomorrow is the kick-off for Black History Month, and the White House is excited to host a series of events this month in recognition of it. In particular, the U.S. Post Office will hold a ceremony tomorrow celebrating the official issuance of the Dorothy Height Forever stamp. Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and is a true pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement.\nFinally, a couple administrative notes. On Friday, the President will depart from this White House to the \"Winter White House\" down at Mar-A-Lago, where he'll spend the weekend and be holding meetings. Further guidance on both trips will be coming out throughout the week.\nAnd I'm excited to announce that following up on our announcement of expanding the press briefing room to Skype seats, we'll officially be launching the briefing room tomorrow. The inaugural panelists will be Natalie Herbick, from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio; Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show; Jeff Jobe, from Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky; and Kimberly Kalunian, from WPRI in Rhode Island. Not sure how she snuck in there. (Laughter.)\nI look forward to virtually welcoming them to the briefing room. And with that, some questions.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ The removal last night of Ms. Yates from her position has raised questions as to how this President will deal with dissent in the ranks currently and in the future. Does he see what she said yesterday as a difference of opinion, an active insubordination? How would he read it? And how will he act on similar things in the future?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's a big difference, John, between listening and sharing ideas, and executing lawful orders. It is the right of every American to express their idea and opinion, and, frankly, that's what you've seen the President do today. We're talking about leaving -- at 2 o'clock hour, him sitting down with cyber experts to get their opinions and ideas on how to protect our critical infrastructures.\nBut there's a difference. When she, as the Acting Attorney General, is not only responsible but required to execute lawful orders and defiantly says \"no,\" as someone who was chosen to lead a department, she was rightfully removed. That is a position of leadership that is given to somebody who is supposed to execute orders that are handed down to them properly, of which that executive order was 100 percent done.\nIronically, it went through their office's -- the Department of Justice Office of Legal Compliance. So the idea that it went through the entire process of which they were part of, and then she chooses not to execute it, actually is bewildering as well as defiant.\nQ So is the President -- so, sorry, can I just follow up on that? So is the President laying down a marker now to all of his Cabinet secretaries and all of his other officials to say, if I give you a directive and you do not follow it, you're gone?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that that kind of comes with the job, right? If you don't believe in the President's agenda -- and I think every one of the Cabinet members, every one of the appointees understands that they serve at the pleasure of the President. We talked about this at length during the transition. This isn't about joining the government to execute your ideas or your initiatives. The President was very clear during the campaign, whether it was economic security or national security, that he has an agenda that he articulated very, very clearly to the American people, and that --\nQ But --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. Thank you. And that it is his job to lay that vision out, and that the people that he appoints and nominates and announces as staff members or Cabinet-level members or agency heads, their job is to fulfill that. And if they don't like it, then they shouldn't take the job. But it is the President's agenda that we are fulfilling here.\nTrey.\nQ Thanks, Sean. As it relates to the executive order today, how will the Trump administration ensure the digital privacy of all Americans as the President looks to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, just to be clear on the executive order, I think one of the things that the President -- the reason the President wants Mayor Giuliani and some of these cyber experts to come in is to get their ideas, to make sure that where we're headed in cybersecurity is fulfilling the intent that ensures that our critical infrastructures throughout the government and, frankly, throughout business -- to the extent that the government can be helpful in that -- are protected and secured.\nSo I just want to caution what we may or may not do today. I think the President has got a pretty good idea of where he's going to go, but I think he wants to hear what Mayor Giuliani and some of these other experts have to say about the steps that we can take in terms of executive action that will help secure further these critical infrastructures.\nApril.\nQ Sean, I have a couple of questions. I want to go back to the issue of this travel ban.\nMR. SPICER: Well, first of all, it's not a travel ban. I think you heard Secretary Kelly -- I apologize, I just want to make sure I get this straight. I think Secretary Kelly or one of the other individuals that got up there from DHS mentioned I think a million people have now come into this country. That's not a ban.\nWhat it is, is to make sure that the people who are coming in are vetted properly from seven countries that were identified by the Obama administration. A ban would mean people can't get in. We've clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries. Sorry. Go ahead.\nQ Okay. But mind you, I have two questions. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: I know, of course.\nQ So with all of this happening, and as you're trying to give specifics about what's happening, what is the concern about the fallout from other countries who are viewing this still in a certain way? Have you looked at the fallout and how to counter it, and how to work with these other countries that may be allies, or even may not be allies, in order to prevent something from happening?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think, April, one of the things that we're doing is trying to make sure that people understand what actually happened. I saw reporting today that Secretary Kelly was out of the loop and he was on a plane and flying, and then it was reported on one of the networks and major institutions about what happened. And Secretary Kelly comes out and says, I was briefed on this time, I was talked on this time, the edits came from my staff. I don't know how -- I don't want to spend each of these briefings talking about misinformation, but at the end of the day, a major newspaper and a major network reported today that they were kept out of the loop. The Secretary detailed multiple occasions in which he was briefed on it. His staff made edits to it.\nI don't know how much more -- and so I think part of what we're trying to do is make sure that people actually understand what happened, what the process was, and what the order actually does. Because when we use words like \"travel ban,\" that misrepresents what it is. It's seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration where, frankly, we don't get the information that we need for people coming into this country.\nBecause what this isn't about is not just the people. It's about the information that another country provides us. So we work with other countries, and we have systems in place to ensure that when you travel from our country to their -- or from their country to our country or vice versa, that we are sharing information about passengers and citizens that are going in and out.\nThese seven countries in particular, we don't have the information that is necessarily required to make an accurate determination at the time of entry into our country. So we are going to make sure that because that country doesn't have maybe either the systems in place or, in some cases, the willingness to provide us the information necessary to ensure that the people that are coming into this country are properly vetted.\nThis isn't about refugees, it's about travelers. And that's what this is about.\nAnd so part of what we're doing is, frankly, making sure that other countries understand exactly what was in the order, how it, how it applies, what it means to visas and waivers and all this kind of stuff. But for the most part, you've seen a lot of panic, and the people actually stopping, reading the order, and realizing, \"oh, that's it?\"\nAnd I think that's what we've tried to make sure that people have the facts.\nQ So you're doing outreach for that?\nMR. SPICER: We're doing -- we're not just doing outreach. I think we're doing as many briefings -- Secretary Kelly going out there a little while ago with the head of both ICE and CBP is trying to make sure that people understand that the process is working correctly -- it's working very well -- that the government is doing what it's supposed to, to protect its people. And that's the number one thing that we can do.\nYeah.\nQ One other -- you said, two.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry. You're right.\nQ Now, the President met with the pharmaceutical heads.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ When is this meeting scheduled for Congressman Elijah Cummings and President Trump, after that call that President Trump made --\nMR. SPICER: Right. My understanding is that Congressman Cummings was -- he was invited to this meeting. He had a scheduling conflict, and we're looking at setting it back up. But he was invited to the meeting today. He informed us he had a scheduling conflict. And we're looking to get it back on the books as soon as we can.\nQ Would it be one on one? Not --\nMR. SPICER: I expect at this point it will be one on one.\nQ Thanks, a lot, Sean. Does the President anticipate a difficult confirmation fight for his nominee, whoever that is?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think we've proven so far that the Democrats can try to obstruct, but at the end of the day, the will of the American people is going to overcome that.\nAnd again, what I mentioned at the outset of this is the advice and consent piece of this. He and our team have met with senators from both sides of the aisle to make sure that we understand the qualities that they are looking for in the next associate justice. And I think that we have done a very, very good job of getting a nominee in place that will be announced tonight that meets the criteria that they set forth. They may not like their political or philosophical background, but I think the criteria in terms of academia background, time on the bench, the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both Republicans and Democrats.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ Do you believe you can get nine Democrats to support this nominee?\nMR. SPICER: I do. Absolutely. Because I think at the end of the day, one of the things that's been a time-honored tradition in this country is that we recognize that the confirmation process is -- the default is that if you're qualified for the position, then you should be confirmed. Not the other around.\nAnd I think that most Democrats realize that at some point that is -- having a court that is not fully operational is not the political fight to have.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ Sean, let me ask you the obvious follow-up question then. At least one Republican senator has said Democrats have removed the filibuster from just about every other appointment, aside from the Supreme Court. And he said several Republicans say they would have no hesitation about moving for another nuclear option if Democrats attempt a filibuster of any of the possible nominees. Is this something the President would support? And has he discussed it with members of the Senate?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think first and foremost taking a step to the last question, I think we're going to get the nine senators regardless, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get more. When you look -- and I'll be able to shed more light on this tomorrow in terms of the background. But I think that he is -- we've got an individual that I think is hopefully going to garner widespread bipartisan support because I think this individual has the qualifications and the experience and the judicial philosophy that should win bipartisan support.\nThat being said, beyond that, I would suggest that that's -- Senator McConnell has done a phenomenal job of moving things along in the Senate to the extent that Democrats will let him. And I'll leave any further questions on how the Senate operates to him.\nBlake.\nQ Sean, thanks. We know that the list of 21 was put out during the campaign. We know that, at 8:02 tonight, the President is going to reveal his selection. Can you kind of fill the gap in between as to how often the President might have spoken with this person, whether there were any meetings here at the White House, just any of the -- how he got there? And then the last hours -- (laughter) -- or in the last days here, really, who has he leaned on to kind of narrow this down? And then a follow-up, if you don't mind.\nMR. SPICER: I will say, I think I can probably shed a lot more light on this tomorrow. I appreciate the effort to try to head that off. Tomorrow I think we might be able to have a little bit more of a discussion as to how the President came to this choice. He may touch on it a little tonight; I'll leave it to him. But I appreciate that.\nQ Let me ask you about the news of the day. Prescription drug prices -- the President met with the pharma leaders earlier today. What makes him so confident that he can drive down drug prices, whereas administrations past have tried to do the same but haven't been able to? How is he going to go about it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think it's the story of his entire administration. He's a successful businessman and a top-notch negotiator. Several people tried to get the cost of planes down, the cost of the F-35 and the cost of the Air Force One. And through a couple of conversations, he did it -- shaved billions off of the cost of both -- excuse me, off the F-35 and significant off the next generation of Air Force One.\nI think he has a track record so far just during the transition, but also as a businessman -- he knows how to negotiate. And I think he is going to sit down with these individuals the same way that he's getting people to understand the agenda and the regulatory and tax climate that he wants to institute that's bringing jobs home. People are making a commitment to him to bring jobs and manufacturing back based on his track record as a businessman and his word. They understand that he's going to create a climate that supports the American worker and American manufacturing.\nSo I think -- you look over and over again, the number of companies that want to come back and say, we want to be part of this agenda to grow the economy and to create jobs or to help you fight on behalf of taxpayers, and I think you're going to continue to see that.\nHe understands the challenges that the bureaucracy that's holding back some of the negotiating, that's allowing these prescription drug prices to drop or get the best deal for the government in cases whether it's Medicare or Medicaid, who are such large buyers of the VA -- that you're not -- you have got such purchasing power that's not being utilized to the full extent.\nHunter Walker.\nQ Thank you, Sean. The President is meeting with Mayor Giuliani today. What do you think of the mayor's claim that the executive order on those seven countries evolved from the Muslim ban that the President proposed during the campaign? Is that accurate?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has talked about extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe for a very, very long time. At the same time, he's also made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban. It's not a travel ban. It's a vetting system to keep America safe -- that's it, plain and simple. And all of the facts and a reading of it clearly show that that's what it is.\nQ Mayor Giuliani stressed that too, but he said that it came out of the desire to have a Muslim ban.\nMR. SPICER: Then you should ask Mayor Giuliani. That's his opinion. I'm just telling you what the President has said and what the President has done has been to focus on making sure that we keep the country safe and that the executive order that was drafted does just that -- is to make sure and to ensure that people coming in from seven countries, identified by the Obama administration, that we didn't have the proper systems to know who was coming into our country was put in place, and a 90-day period was also granted to ensure that we knew how to further address vetting situations in the future.\nZeke.\nQ Thanks, Sean. Just following up again about the strike over the weekend in Yemen. Can you confirm that the eight-year-old -- the reports that the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in that strike? And if you can address sort of the killing of the American citizen in this anti-terrorism operation.\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to go any further than what the Department of Defense has released. Obviously, we recovered a tremendous amount of information, and we killed an estimated 14 members of al Qaeda in -- AQAP individuals. And then we suffered the loss of life of a servicemember, and four people were injured. That's as far as I'm willing to go at this time.\nKristen.\nQ Sean, thanks. You're saying it's not a ban. This was President Trump's tweet yesterday: \"If the ban were announced with a one-week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week.\" So he says it's a ban.\nMR. SPICER: He's using the words that the media is using. But at the end of the day, it can't --\nQ Those are his words.\nQ Wait a minute.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, hold on. It can't be --\nQ That's his words, his tweet.\nMR. SPICER: Jonathan, thanks, I'll let Kristen talk. It can't be a ban if you're letting a million people in. If 325,000 people from another country can't come in, that is by nature not a ban -- it is extreme vetting.\nQ I understand your point. But the President himself called it a ban.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that.\nQ Is he confused or are you confused?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not confused. I think that the words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this. He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting.\nQ It seems to fit into this broader point, Sean, which Paul Ryan said today: \"I think it's regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this.\" The House Speaker saying that. What do you say to Republicans who argue that this is a part of a broader issue with the President not enacting this policy smoothly?\nMR. SPICER: Well, first of all, I think we've addressed that -- that we could have either telegraphed this days in advance, in which people could have gotten on planes and come over here, which would have undermined the exact nature of what this sought to prevent. Or we could have done it in a way that inconvenienced some folks for a little while --\nQ But do you dispute that there was confusion --\nMR. SPICER: Can I answer the -- no, no, I do -- there's clearly some confusion. But I think part of it, your network was one of the people that just hours ago told people that General Kelly was unaware of what's going on. And then moments later he gets on air saying, here's how many times I got briefed. So, I mean, with all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion. You have helped cause this, despite claims that whatever. You claim that you have sources that tell us. General Kelly stands up and says, this is how many times I've been briefed, this is how many people were involved. And yet you were out there for --\nQ I think there was a New York Times report that was cited --\nMR. SPICER: Oh, okay, so I apologize if NBC News's reporting is based on The New York Times's false reporting.\nQ It was accurate reporting, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: How can it be accurate reporting, Glenn, if --\nQ Both things can be true.\nQ It was accurate reporting, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, so the --\nQ They can be true that he --\nMR. SPICER: The Secretary of Homeland Security just stood up, and so you're calling him a liar?\nQ He didn't say he saw the specifics of the --\nMR. SPICER: Jonathan, I'm talking to Glenn. I'm talking to Glenn.\nQ No one is calling anyone a liar. I'm saying we --\nMR. SPICER: You said that the report in the New York Times said that he was unaware of the ban.\nQ Sean, let me ask you a question.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no, answer the question. Because you just called this --\nQ So a couple of minutes ago you stood at the podium and you reiterated something you said yesterday about anyone who doesn't agree in terms of career bureaucracy should hit the road. I'm paraphrasing. You had a statement that President Trump made where he accused the acting Attorney General of \"betraying\" her own department by expressing a counter opinion. Don't you think that kind of language has a chilling effect on the public statements that your officials make?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think there's a big difference. Think about the process that worked it here. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Compliance vetted the executive order, sent it back to us saying it was completely compliant. Then the acting Attorney General goes out and says, I'm not going to enforce it. You tell me how that jives. Because at the end of the day, if the action Attorney General has an office under her jurisdiction that says that something is legal and compliant, and then she gets out there and says, I'm not going to enforce it, that doesn't sound like an Attorney General that is upholding the duty that she swore to uphold.\nQ Well, if she think it's illegal --\nMR. SPICER: At the end of the day -- then she should step down. But at the end of the day, the Attorney General either had a problem with her own division approving something. But it wasn't the President she had a problem with. The President followed the process, sought feedback, went through the inter-agency review, had other departments sign off, despite the reporting that said it was otherwise.\nQ But is this a betrayal, though?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. Guys --\nQ Is it a betrayal?\nMR. SPICER: David.\nQ That's a very hard word.\nMR. SPICER: Why don't we just let me answer Glenn so we can be polite now, huh?\nAnd what the answer is, is that we went through the process. The Office of Legal Compliance came back and said, this is a compliant executive order, it's fully legal, and it can be executed.\nSo then for the Attorney General to turn around and say, I'm not going to uphold this lawful executive order is clearly a dereliction of duty. And she should have been removed, and she was. I just -- it is odd to me that we're having a discussion about somebody whose job it is to execute lawful orders who chose not to do it -- hold on -- who chose not to do it, and then we're questioning whether or not we were right to remove her. That's the right thing to do.\nAnd if you looked at the folks from the right and the left, constitutional scholars this morning -- they said, we might not agree with some of the policies or the political -- or the party of the President, but he was right to do this. He had every right --\nQ So why use the word \"betrayal\" --\nMR. SPICER: Because the department's job is to execute. They're the Department of Justice. And if you have a legally executed order and the Attorney General says, I'm not going to execute it, that truly -- that clearly is a betrayal of what she's --\nQ Let's define the word \"betrayal.\"\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to define the word, Glenn.\nYes.\nQ Sean, I think the New York Times report said that the Secretary did not receive a full briefing until the executive order was being signed. So my question is, can we expect that secretaries, agency heads, when there are future executive orders or changes of policy, may not receive full briefings before --\nMR. SPICER: Look, the Secretary was briefed on multiple occasions with the language of the order. I don't know how you can say this any other way.\nQ Well, I'm just talking about a full briefing, which is what the New York Times reported.\nMR. SPICER: And I'm telling you that I don't believe the New York Times reporting is accurate. What I'm telling you is that the Secretary on multiple occasions was briefed, his senior officials were briefed -- not just briefed; they were part of the drafting process. It went through -- not only that. Just back up. So they get consulted and briefed. It goes through the Office of Legal Compliance. Then it gets shipped out to the NSC and the Homeland Security Council. This went through a very, very extensive staffing process.\nSo the idea that you can talk whether or not he got fully briefed or -- he was briefed multiple times, saw the language. His staff made edits. It came back multiple times. I'm not sure how much more briefing you can do.\nQ Thank you, Sean. Zoe Daniel, from Australian Broadcasting. Thanks for taking the question. The Australian government made a recent deal with the Obama administration whereby the U.S. would take refugees from Australia's offshore detention centers. Now most of these people are from Iran, but also some are from Iraq and Somalia, among other places. Can you confirm that this deal is still on? Are those refugees exempt from what you describe as the extreme vetting? Or will that deal change or be delayed?\nMR. SPICER: So the deal specifically deals with 1,250 people. They're mostly in Papua New Guinea, being held. Those people -- part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we're doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them. That is part and parcel of the deal that was made. And it was made by the Obama administration with the full backing of the United States government.\nThe President, in accordance with that deal to honor what had been agreed upon by the United States government, and in ensuring that that vetting will take place in the same manner that we're doing it now, will go forward.\nYes.\nQ The big question -- looking at the bigger picture -- this President, when he came in, said he was going to gather us all together, that he was going to bring us together. And the actions taken in the first 10 days seem to indicate otherwise from people in his own party -- the use of the word \"betrayal.\" How is this President going to address the fact that people are looking to him to bring people together, and yet with his own words seems to be driving us apart?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's a very one-sided way of looking at this. I think he's brought --\nQ Elaborate.\nMR. SPICER: I will. I think he's brought unions together, business leaders together, Republicans, Democrats, independents. I think someone who doesn't carry out an act and using that as a way to describe that he's not bringing the country together is not exactly a representation.\nQ I have one quick follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. I don't -- I'm not -- the President has done a tremendous amount through both what he has said and done, more importantly, to start to bring this country together. And his policies, frankly, are focused on keeping every American safe and getting every American a higher-paying and better-paying job. I think that is something that benefits all of us.\nQ The follow-up -- I asked you about a shield law for journalists last week. You said you would get with this?\nQ If I could just --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on.\nQ -- ask real quick on trade. Now that notices have been given to the TPP countries, are you considering any changes in the roles of your three sort of official trade negotiators? And what area of the globe are you going to start first on negotiations?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's no change in their roles. I'm not entirely sure. I think they -- as announced --\nQ (Inaudible) negotiator --\nMR. SPICER: He is the U.S. -- I mean, he's got to be confirmed first, but the U.S. trade representative is clearly the leader of negotiating trade deals. Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro and Jason Greenblatt -- there's a great, unbelievably robust, brilliant team that has continued to work on behalf of deals and renegotiating, looking at them. So it's a two-step process.\nI think, number one, we're going to reexamine all of the current trade deals, figure out if we can re-improve them. But secondly, I think we're going to start talking to other countries around the globe, including some of those TPP partners. I think of the 11 other countries, five of them we have current trade deals with. So you would examine those to see if we can improve upon them and then look at the other countries in there and see if there's a willingness to engage with some of those other countries.\nQ Sean, the President has previously indicated that he would encourage the targeting of families of terror suspects. Is that still his current position?\nMR. SPICER: When did he say that?\nQ December 3rd, on Fox. He said, \"The other thing with [the] terrorists is you have to take out their families.\" Is that still his position?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's been very clear that when it comes to seeking out ISIS and other terrorists, that he's going to lean on Director Pompeo, General Mattis, and seek their opinion on stuff. And I think that will be continued.\nSarah.\nQ Even the families of terror suspects, civilian members of families, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. Rebecca.\nQ On Guantanamo, Sean. Thanks for taking this question. I know that you've indicated at that podium that there will be further action. What does this look like? And there are five detainees that have been cleared for transfer that are sitting at Guantanamo. Would this administration take action in the next coming months on those detainees?\nMR. SPICER: I think all of those actions are being currently reviewed, and we don't have anything further at this time.\nQ The Obama administration's endangerment finding undergirds the Clean Power Plan. Does the President still plan to revoke the Clean Power Plan? And would he perhaps even go further and try and revoke the endangerment finding?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President has made very clear with respect to energy policy that he wants to review all of the options that we have to use our natural resources to better the country in terms of wind power, solar, clean coal. We're in the process of reviewing all of our energy policies. I'd go back to note that we don't have an Energy Secretary confirmed right now because the Senate hasn't yet moved forward with that. I hope that once that's done, we will have further updates on energy.\nMatt.\nQ Sean, Sally Yates was obviously an Obama appointee, was holding it through the transition. How many more of them are there throughout the government at this time, as the transition and confirmation process plays out? And do you expect any more problems from any of the other ones?\nMR. SPICER: In some cases, we've held some individuals over because they hold a critical position within government. In some cases, we've named folks as acting. It's a case-by-case basis. And again, I think part of it right now is the President wanted to focus on getting his Cabinet up and complete. We'll continue to make nominations both at the deputy, under and assistant secretary-level.\nBut in key agencies -- so, ICE being one of them, where it's an assistant secretary. But there are 30 other agencies where we've named acting heads to ensure that as we move through the confirmation process, we have somebody in that position to ensure continuity of government.\nDaniel.\nQ Sean, yesterday you said 109 individuals were affected by this extreme vetting.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ DHS officials said that it was over 1,100.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on. First of all, just to be clear, what they're talking about is the number of people who weren't allowed to board a plane coming in. So they were stopped at their port of entry, had to get additional clearance, and then take off. There's a big difference. The numbers that we're talking about were the initial group of people that were in transit at the time the executive order was signed.\nAnd then there's another group of people -- and the Department of Homeland Security has those numbers up to date on their website -- where they're talking about people that are stopped at the port of entry to ensure that they're properly vetted before they board a plane. There's a very, very delicate distinction between people who were on the plane coming into this country when the executive order was signed, all of who have been vetted and cleared, and the people who have been stopped at a port of entry in one of those seven countries to ensure that the proper vetting took place before they were able to move on.\nQ Sean, Hallie's question was about civilians that are being targeted by the administration in anti-terror raids. And Zeke's question was about al-Awlaki's daughter. So let me ask you: Is the President willing to kill and target American citizens, even minors, just because their family members are terrorists?\nMR. SPICER: No American citizen will ever be targeted.\nQ One more follow-up there. If you're qualified for the position -- you said earlier, if you're qualified for the position, you should get confirmed. That's not how Merrick Garland was treated in the previous administration.\nMR. SPICER: No, there's never been a situation in which you had a fourth-term -- someone that late in an election cycle. That had never occurred before. And I think that the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice, and that's exactly what happened.\nAs I noted at the beginning of this, 70 percent of people thought that the President's choice for the next Supreme Court was a major decision. That was something he campaigned on. I think when you're that late in a term -- it had never happened before. And the goal was to make sure that the voters had a say in allowing that to happen. And I think that, clearly, it worked. The voters looked at that as a major reason in which they voted for the President. And I think that as we move forward, that's why I think we're going to get the support we need.\nQ Sean, if the President does get his pick on the bench, what are any specific cases that the administration hopes that the Court takes up in the near future\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's a lot of cases that I think are in the queue right now that have the potential to be 4-4. I think the idea is to get this individual confirmed as soon as possible just to get the docket moving. That's probably the biggest priority right now.\nThank you guys very much. Have a great day. I'll see you tonight. Good luck. Eight o'clock.\nEND - 1:50 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-01-31", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 2:21 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to White House Chief of Staff Reinhold R. \"Reince\" Priebus, in his former capacity as chairman of the Republican National Committee; Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis; Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly; White House Senior Adviser Jared C. Kushner; and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Thomas P. Bossert. Mr. Giuliani referred to Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian L. Gorka. The transcript, prepared for immediate release by the Office of the Press Secretary, was received by the Office of the Federal Register on July 27.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128070", "text": "The President. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, everybody, for being here. We appreciate it. Today I'm convening this meeting to follow through on my promise to secure crucial infrastructure and the networks—that we've been talking so much about over the last period of time—of the Federal Government against cyber threats.\nI will hold my Cabinet Secretaries and agency heads accountable—totally accountable—for the cybersecurity of their organization, of which we probably don't have as much, certainly not as much as we should have. We will defend and protect Federal networks and data. We operate these networks on behalf of the American people, and they are very important and very sacred. We will empower these agencies to modernize their IT systems for better security and other reasons.\nWe will protect our critical infrastructure such as power plants and electrical grids. The electrical grid problem is a problem, but we'll have it solved relatively soon. We must work with private sector—the private sector is way ahead of Government in this case—to ensure that owners and operators of critical infrastructure have the support they need from the Federal Government to defend against cyber threats.\nNow, I think a pretty good example of this was, despite having spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars—more money than we did—the Democratic National Committee was hacked successfully, very successfully, and terribly, frankly. And the Republican National Committee was not hacked, meaning it was hacked, but they failed. All right? It was reported, I believe, by Reince and other people that it was hacked, but we had a very strong defense system against hacking.\nSo despite spending a lot less money than the Democrats and, in all fairness, winning—people don't say that—we spent a lot less money, Admiral, and we won. That's good, right? Isn't that a good thing, when you can spend less and win?\nNational Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers. Yes, sir.\nThe President. But we were also very successful in our defense against hacking.\nWe're going to make sure that cybersecurity is central to both our military and the ships, planes, and tanks built by great Americans for our great American military. And our military will become stronger and stronger as we go along.\nI just met with General Mattis, and he's doing a great job. We're really happy with him and everybody. You probably saw General Kelly; he was spectacular today on his press conference, and we appreciate everything he said.\nWith that, I want to introduce Rudy Giuliani, and he's going to be working with Jared Kushner and with Tom Bossert, who are also here. And Rudy is very much of an expert on cybersecurity. It's been a very important thing to him and to what he does. And maybe I'll ask Rudy to say a few words.\nWhere is Rudy? Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City. Well, thanks. Thank you very, very much, Mr. President. And first of all, congratulations on what is, in fact, a historic start of an administration. I've never seen so much done in so short a period of time than ever. I was in the early part of the Reagan administration; we used to sit in this room every Thursday, and I remember how fast they got off to a start, and you're about three times ahead of them. I don't remember the Roosevelt thousand days, but I think you may be ahead of him. And you're doing it without a Cabinet, with three, four members.\nThe President. It would help if the Democrats approved my Cabinet, I will say. [Laughter]\nMr. Giuliani. So congratulations. And what you've been doing is keeping your promises, and this is one of your promises. One of your promises was to shore up our country because one of the dangers we face—national security and crime—is cybersecurity. And a large part of our country, unlike other countries, is made up of the private sector. And the private sector is wide open to hacking. And sometimes, by hacking the private sector, you can get into Government.\nSo we can't do this separately, and you were wise enough to decide that we should have a Council where we can bring in the private sector, they can explain to you the problems they have, they can explain to the administration the solutions they have, which, in some cases, may be better than the Government; in some cases they may not be as good as the Government. Plus, we can search around the world, including in countries like Israel and places where they're doing a lot of advanced cybersecurity analysis; we can look for long-term solutions.\nSo here, you're addressing not only a national security problem, but you're addressing the fastest growing form of crime in America, which is cyber theft. It's growing faster than any other crime.\nAnd finally, by speaking out on this and holding regular meetings on it, you're using the bully pulpit of the Presidency to get the private sector to wake up. Some of the private sector has awakened to the fact that they have to do more about cybersecurity, but part of it hasn't. And as President, you are in a unique position to get the private sector to realize that they have to pitch in and help the Government.\nAnd I'll work very closely with Jared and with Tom and Sebastian Gorka and all the people that you have that are working on this. And we'll take our priorities from you. If what you—if first you want to do is look at the grid, we'll bring in all the private grid companies and solution companies. If you want to look at financial institutions, we'll do financial institutions. If you want to look at hospitals, we'll bring in hospitals.\nBut we'll let you set the priorities so we can have a very, very close working relationships. And congratulations on fulfilling another one of your campaign promises.\nThe President. Well, thank you very much, Rudy. I appreciate it. And I know you're going to do a great job. And you've formed a Committee. And we're going to go into great detail, and we'll have it up and running. And we'll be doing something very special in many ways.\nI want to just thank Senator Dan Coats. Thank you very much for being here, Senator. Would you have anything to say about cyber?\nDirector of National Intelligence-designate Daniel R. Coats. Clearly, it's risen to a top priority because of the impact that it can have. My job, if confirmed—and I'm not confirmed yet—— The President. I have a feeling you'll make it.\nDirector-designate Coats. Well, I hope so. [Laughter] My job is to make sure the intelligence community provides every bit of intelligence that they can so that the policies that can be affected are the right policies to deal with this. I think this is an enormous challenge, but one that is a significant threat to our country and something that needs to be—we have to get after this right away.\nThe President. Well, I want to thank you for your service and thank you for everything you've done, even over the last week. Your knowledge is amazing, and everybody has great respect. So thank you very much.\nDirector-designate Coats. Don't oversell your man. [Laughter]\nThe President. He thought he was going to leave after many years in the Senate and have a nice, peaceful life, when I called him—\"Dan, how about going a little bit longer?\" And we really do appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nAnd, Admiral, thank you very much, Mike, for being here. Would you have anything to say about cyber?\nDirector Rogers. Other than, as Mr. Giuliani indicated, I believe the key here is going to be partnerships between the private sector and the Government; it's our ability to bring together the capabilities of both, that's the sweet spot.\nThe President. Good. Well, we'll do that. And as you know, John Kelly just gave a very long news conference and a very, very good one and effective one. And while he's warmed up—[laughter]—you might as well go for another 1 minute or 2 minutes.\nSecretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. I have a lot of things to say about cyber, but I think I'll just learn at the feet of the wise men here, sir.\nThe President. Going to have a lot to do with the border and with, really, I mean, if you think about it, a lot to do with what you're doing. It's going to be very important.\nWell, thank you all very much. And we're going to have a meeting, and we're going to get it going. Thank you, gentlemen.\nQ. Are you going to get your Supreme Court nominee through, Mr. President?\nQ. Any clue on who you'll choose?\nMr. Giuliani. I'd like to point out—one second. I'd just like to point out one person—General Keith Alexander——\nThe President. Hold up, one second, Rudy was just saying one thing.\nMr. Giuliani. General Keith Alexander is probably the person who knows the most about cybersecurity of anyone that I know.\nThe President. Good.\nMr. Giuliani. And he, I hope, will play a very, very big role in this.\nFormer National Security Agency Director Keith B. Alexander. We're looking forward to supporting you, Mr. President, and you——\nMr. Giuliani. This man is a tremendous resource. The President. Thank you. That's great. Thank you, General. That's very nice. And we'll see you in a little while; we'll be announcing a Supreme Court Justice who I think everybody is going to be very, very impressed with. So we'll see you at about 8 o'clock.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-31", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting on Cybersecurity"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 8:02 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Maureen McCarthy Scalia, wife of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin G. Scalia. Associate Justice-designate Gorsuch referred to Vice President Michael R. Pence; former Chief Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit; and his daughters Emma and Belinda. The transcript, prepared for immediate release by the Office of the Press Secretary, was received by the Office of the Federal Register on July 27.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123897", "text": "The President. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\nWhen Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected President, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court. I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written.\nThis may be the most transparent judicial selection process in history. Months ago, as a candidate, I publicly presented a list of brilliant and accomplished people to the American electorate and pledged to make my choice from among that list. Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for President. I am a man of my word. I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time. Today—[applause]. Thank you.\nToday I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court—to be of the United States Supreme Court, and I would like to ask Judge Gorsuch and his wonderful wife Louise to please step forward. Please, Louise, Judge. Here they come. Here they come.\nSo was that a surprise? Was it?\nI have always felt that after the defense of our Nation, the most important decision a President of the United States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice. Depending on their age, a Justice can be active for 50 years, and his or her decisions can last a century or more and can often be permanent. I took the task of this nomination very seriously. I have selected an individual whose qualities define—really, and I mean closely define—what we're looking for. Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support.\nWhen he was nominated to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, he was confirmed by the Senate unanimously. Also—that's unanimous. Can you believe that nowadays with what's going on? [Laughter] Does that happen anymore? Does it happen? I think it's going to happen maybe again.\nAlso with us tonight is Maureen Scalia, a woman loved by her husband and deeply respected by all. I am so happy she is with us. Where is Maureen? Please stand up. Thank you, Maureen. Thank you, Maureen.\nShe is really the ultimate representative of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, whose image and genius was in my mind throughout the decisionmaking process. Not only are we looking at the writings of the nominee, and I studied them closely, but he is said to be among the finest and most brilliant—oftentimes the writings—of any judge for a long, long time.\nAnd his academic credentials—something very important to me in that education has always been a priority—are as good as I have ever seen. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia with honors. He then received his law degree from Harvard, also with honors, where he was a Truman Scholar. After Harvard, he received his doctorate at Oxford, where he attended as a Marshall Scholar, one of the top academic honors anywhere in the world. After law school, he clerked on the Supreme Court for both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. It is an extraordinary résumé, as good as it gets.\nJudge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado and was taught the value of independence, hard work, and public service. While in law school, he demonstrated a commitment to helping the less fortunate. He worked in both Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Projects and Harvard Defenders program. Brilliance being assured, I studied every aspect of his life. He could have had any job, at any law firm, for any amount of money, but what he wanted to do with his career was to be a judge, to write decisions, and to make an impact by upholding our laws and our Constitution.\nThe qualifications of Judge Gorsuch are beyond dispute. He's the man of our country and a man who our country really needs and needs badly to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. I would like to thank Senate leadership. I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together, for once, for the good of the country.\nCongratulations to you and your family. May God bless you. May God bless our glorious nation.\nJudge Gorsuch, the podium, sir, is yours.\nAssociate Justice-designate Gorsuch. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President, thank you very much. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, you and your team have shown me great courtesy in this process, and you've entrusted me with a most solemn assignment. Standing here, in a house of history, and acutely aware of my own imperfections, I pledge that, if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country.\nFor the last decade, I have worked as a Federal judge in a court that spans 6 western States, serving about 20 percent of the continental United States and about 18 million people. The men and women I have worked with at every level in our circuit are an inspiration to me. I've watched them fearlessly tending to the rule of law, enforcing the promises of our Constitution, and living out daily their judicial oaths to administer justice equally to rich and poor alike, following the law as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs. I think of them tonight.\nOf course, the Supreme Court's work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of the people's liberties under law and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. The towering judges that have served in this particular seat of the Supreme Court, including Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson, are much in my mind at this moment. Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench cherished his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him.\nI began my legal career working for Byron White, the last Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court and the only Justice to lead the NFL in rushing. [Laughter] He was one of the smartest and most courageous men I have ever known. When Justice White retired, he gave me the chance to work for Justice Kennedy as well. Justice Kennedy was incredibly welcoming and gracious, and like Justice White, he taught me so much. I am forever grateful. And if you've ever met Judge David Sentelle, you'll know just how lucky I was to land a clerkship with him right out of school. [Laughter] Thank you. These judges brought me up in the law. Truly, I would not be here without them. Today is as much their day as it is mine. In the balance of my professional life, I've had the privilege of working as a practicing lawyer and teacher. I've enjoyed wonderful colleagues whose support means so much to me at this moment, as it has year in and year out. Practicing in the trial work trenches of the law, I saw too that when we judges don our robes, it doesn't make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what's expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage.\nAs this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward with speaking with Members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the Constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges.\nI respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge—[laughter]—stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.\nI am so thankful tonight for my family, my friends, and my faith. These are the things that keep me grounded at life's peaks and have sustained me in its valleys.\nTo Louise, my incredible wife and companion of 20 years, my cherished daughters who are watching on TV—[laughter]—and all my family and friends, I cannot thank you enough for your love and for your prayers. I could not attempt this without you.\nMr. President, I am honored, and I am humbled. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-01-31", "title": "Remarks on the Nomination of Neil M.
