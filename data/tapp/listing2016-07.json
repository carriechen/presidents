{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117667", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:23 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: All right, good afternoon, everybody. Happy Friday. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKathleen, you want to start?\nQ: Sure. First, I just wanted to start with if you have any update on the Istanbul attack, if you can confirm these reports that the man behind it was a Chechen extremist.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of these reports. I'm not in a position to confirm them at this point. Obviously, this is a Turkish-led investigation. U.S. officials are devoting significant time and energy and attention to learning what we can about this incident, as well. And when we have information that we think could be useful to Turkish investigators, we will share it with them. But at this point, I don't have an updated assessment to share.\nQ: So was Chairman McCaul off base, or out too far ahead of the administration? He's come out and confirmed his name.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of his comments. But you'd have to ask him or his staff about the nature of them.\nQ: Okay. And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Attorney General's comments about her meeting with President Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: I suspected you might.\nQ: So she said she fully expects to accept the recommendation from investigators in the FBI. If that's the case, should she just recuse herself from the case entirely in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety there? And can you tell us whether or not the White House and the President were involved in that decision?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that the White House and the President were not at all involved in that decision. I will leave it to the Attorney General to describe the role that she will play and the process that the Department of Justice will undertake as they conduct this investigation.\nThe President's expectation is that this investigation will be handled just like all the others, which is that the investigators will be guided by the facts, they will follow the evidence, and they will reach a conclusion based on that evidence and nothing else. That's the President's expectation about how this should be handled.\nI think the Attorney General in her most recent comments indicated that that was her expectation about how this will be handled. But I'll leave it to her to describe what role she will play and what process the Department of Justice will follow in the conducting this investigation.\nQ: She said she understood that the meeting sort of cast a shadow on the investigation. I guess, do you think that now that shadow is lifted, that she's gone far enough?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I didn't attend the meeting. I'll let her describe the meeting. And if it's had any impact on the investigation, I'll let her describe that, as well. This is something that is being handled completely independent of the President and completely independent of the White House.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, just to follow up on that, you said yesterday you hadn't had a chance to speak with the President about it. Have you since? And is he frustrated about this issue and the fact that that meeting took place?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I have not raised this directly with the President, so I have not discussed this particular piece of news with him. But what I do feel confident in telling you -- even though I have not discussed it with him -- is that he believes that this matter should be handled without regard to politics. And he believes this investigation should be conducted based on facts, not based on the political affiliation or the political standing of anybody who may be involved in it. That is the way that these kinds of investigations have been handled in the past. It's the way these kinds of investigations have been handled throughout President Obama's tenure in office. And it's his expectation that that's how these kinds of investigations should be handled in the future.\nQ: Does that suggest then that he would also be supportive of her decision that she has articulated today that she will accept the recommendations of the FBI and not intend to overrule them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President feels strongly that that is a decision that she should make without regard to his opinion about it. These are independent decisions that should be handled by the Department of Justice. And it's appropriate for the Attorney General to determine what her role is. And she's spoken to that today, and that is appropriate for her to do. And, frankly, my view of that matter or even the President's view of that matter is not relevant. This is an independent investigation that is intentionally being shielded from any sort of political interference.\nQ: Moving on to the next week, the President will be campaigning with Secretary Clinton on Tuesday. Can you give us a sense of the message that he intends to bring to that? Will he have anything more to say about Bernie Sanders? And how will he be trying to attract voters for her in that state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I don't think anything the President has to say on Tuesday will be a particular surprise to those of you who have been covering the President for a long time. The President obviously has had an opportunity to evaluate Secretary Clinton both when they were competing against one another on the campaign trail, but also when she was serving this country as the Secretary of State under President Obama.\nAnd over the years, the President has developed a deep appreciation for her toughness under fire and her commitment to a set of values that the President shares. So those attributes, that character, those values are principally the reason the President believes that she is the best person to succeed him in the Oval Office. Those are the reasons that the President has decided to support her campaign. And I think that will be the essence of the case that he will make on Tuesday in Charlotte.\nQ: All right. And lastly, there was a ruling in Austria today allowing for a rerun of a presidential election there, giving the far-right party a second chance at trying to achieve office. Are you concerned about that ruling? And is the White House more broadly concerned about the rise of the far right in Europe?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I didn't see the news about the specific ruling, so I'll have to take that aspect of your question. But I think the President has spoken more generally about the question that voters -- not just in the United States but around the world -- will have to face in terms of how countries want to engage in the world.\nAnd obviously the Austrian people will make their own decisions about who they believe should lead their country. But politicians in Austria certainly have a strong case to make about the way their country has benefitted from engaging with their partners and allies across the continent of Europe. The President certainly made a strong case about how the United States of America has benefitted -- both economically and from the security perspective -- when it comes to our engagement with the world. And whether that is trade agreements that expand economic opportunity for American workers and American businesses, or national security alliances that keep us safe, the United States benefits from using our influence and using our advantages to advance our interests around the world.\nThat has certainly been true over the course of his presidency, and he believes that -- President Obama certainly believes that his successor is somebody who should continue that strategy.\nMark.\nQ: Yes, Josh, can I ask about this report that I gather we're getting on drone strikes and the executive order that the President is planning to issue along with it? Why the need for some greater clarity in the rules on drone strikes? And does the President think that the numbers show that there have been too many civilian deaths and more that he was expecting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I can't speak to the specific numbers. I do anticipate that the Office of the DNI will have some news to make on this relatively shortly. So they'll have some context to present alongside those numbers, but I'm not going to speak to them at this point.\nI also anticipate that there will be some news a little later today on steps that the President believes would be useful in ensuring that the counterterrorism strategy that he has put in place is one that continues to be transparent and durable going forward.\nThe President believes that our counterterrorism strategy is more effective and has more credibility when we're as transparent as possible. There are obviously limitations for transparency when it comes to matters as sensitive as this, but the fact is, these operations that will be the substance of an announcement later today are the kinds of operations that just a couple of years ago we wouldn't even confirm existed.\nAnd I think it's an indication of how far that we've come that we're now in a position where we are describing the process for making decisions about these kinds of operations and being rather transparent with not just the American public but with the world about the outcome of those operations, even when the outcome is not entirely consistent with our intentions. Because the truth is, the United States of America goes farther than is even required by international law to avoid civilian casualties. That certainly is a stark contrast to the adversary that we face that seeks to maximize civilian casualties to try to advance their narrative. The United States, on the other hand, goes to great lengths to avoid those kinds of civilian casualties. And when we fall short or when those efforts are not as successful as we would like, the President believes it's important for us to be as transparent as possible about those results.\nAnd in doing so, yeah, that may mean that there will be a little bit of negative press coverage in the short term, but over the long term, it will build the kind of credibility that is critical to the ongoing success of these efforts.\nQ: But by issuing the guidelines to go with these numbers, is the President acknowledging that there were instances where civilian deaths or the possibility of civilian deaths were not properly taken into account in making targeted decisions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the architecture that the President plans to discuss later today -- and by that, I mean I don't anticipate that the President will be making a statement later today, but information that we will be able to release on paper from the President later today. I just want to be -- I don't want to ruin anybody's Friday afternoon plans here. (Laughter.) So consider that a public service announcement.\nThe point is, the President believes that it's important to put an architecture in place that reflects the kinds of reforms that this administration has implemented to ensure that proper steps are taken to avoid civilian casualties and to ensure that the operations that are undertaken are consistent with our national security goals. You will recall that when President Obama took office, drone technology was relatively new. And, again, it was something that was not discussed from this podium and there were a lot of legitimate policy questions about how this new technology and this new tool could be used to protect the American people.\nAnd there is an extraordinary amount of work that's been done not just over the last two or three years, but really over the last seven and a half years, to organize an architecture for making decisions about how to use this technology and how to use this tool to enhance the safety and security of the American people. This is a tool that this administration and this President has used frequently in a way that has had a devastating impact on the ability of terrorists to establish a safe haven and use the safety of that safe haven to plot against the United States and our interests.\nSo this is a powerful tool -- one that has been used to great effect and one that makes the American people safer. But the President believes it's important for us to establish a structure to guide how that tool is used not just for the remainder of this administration but into the next one, and also to establish a regular mechanism for bringing some transparency to those efforts. And that includes at least some transparency around those occasions when the outcome is not as good as we expected.\nQ: But not to belabor the point, Josh, does not the issue in some of these guidelines imply some regret about the way things have transpired to date?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this will be an easier conversation for us to have once you have seen these guidelines. And this is why this is important: The guidelines extend far beyond steps that should be taken to prevent civilian casualties; that there are a whole host of other questions that are raised about when this technology and when this tool can be used in an appropriate and in an effective way.\nSo certainly the question of civilian casualties is a critically important one, both for moral reasons but also for legitimate policy reasons, too. And that certainly will be discussed in some of the language that you'll see, and the report that's issued by the DNI I think will illustrate the greater transparency that we're bringing to this. I also don't want to overpromise because not all the questions will be answered by the material that is presented, and I think that is an indication of how difficult it is to be completely transparent about matters that are this sensitive.\nBut I think it would be very difficult to deny the remarkable progress that has been made over even just the last couple of years, where we have gone from refusing to even confirm that these kinds of operations are taking place to now disclosing proactively not just the fact that they have taken place but to chronicle some of the outcomes, including those that are negative.\nQ: Speaking of negative outcomes, why not include Afghan and Iraq and Syria in this -- the numbers that we're going to see?\nMR. EARNEST: Because -- and we'll have a more robust explanation of this, but let me just take a shot here -- operations that are carried out by the Department of Defense already have a regular mechanism for disclosing the results of those operations. So you regularly get news releases, for example, from Central Command detailing individual operations that take place in Iraq, for example. And there have been a number of situations where the Department of Defense, after a careful analysis, has disclosed that there were civilian casualties associated with individual operations.\nSo there is a mechanism for doing that when operations are carried out by the Department of Defense. When there are counterterrorism operations carried out not by the Department of Defense, there was not an established mechanism for reporting the outcome, and that's what's being established today and that's what will be reported for the first time today.\nQ: Can I follow on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Go ahead, Kevin, sure.\nQ: So if I'm understanding you, the things that are Title 50 then would all begin to move over to Title 10, which is more standard in recognizing and releasing information about these certain strikes. Is that your understanding?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for technical questions, we'll be able to talk about this a little bit more today. But the point is, operations that are carried out by the Department of Defense already have a mechanism for public reporting, both in terms of specific operations that are undertaken and the battlefield assessment that's done with regard to those operations. They also have a mechanism for reporting in those rare instances where civilian casualties that we go to great lengths to avoid are nonetheless sustained. And so there's a mechanism for transparency that's built into the Department of Defense process.\nThere has not heretofore been a process for disclosing specifics around counterterrorism operations that are not carried out by the Department of Defense.\nQ: Which would fall under Title 50.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I've said what I can say.\nQ: I got it. Quick on Hillary, will she be riding aboard Air Force One?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have details about the travel arrangements for Tuesday at this point, but we'll keep you posted.\nQ: Is it certainly possible?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you can check with her campaign to determine how exactly she's going to get to Charlotte. The President will be riding Air Force One to Charlotte. (Laughter.)\nQ: Fair enough. During the Brexit controversy, if you want to call it that, Advisor Rice talked about contingency plans and things that happen whether it goes one way or the other way. And I'm just curious if the White House has made a contingency plan in the event that Secretary Clinton were to be criminally indicted.\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. I'm not really sure what impact that specifically would have on any specific policy around here.\nQ: Would the President then say, encourage someone else to run for the nomination, if that happened?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, that's a hypothetical situation. I won't get into that.\nQ: Last thing. You talked about an indication of how far we have come in disclosing not just often what has happened, unfortunately, as it relates to drone strikes. Is it fair to say then that you are satisfied with where we are along the continuum in this presidency in terms of disclosure, in terms of using the mechanisms as you have been to inform the American people and, indeed, the world when you have utilized drone strikes?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, again, we have made remarkable progress in both establishing an architecture for making smart policy decisions about when to use this incredibly powerful counterterrorism tool. And part of that architecture also includes the extraordinary lengths that this administration goes to and our national security professionals go to, to avoid civilian casualties. Of course, that stands in quiet stark contrast to our adversaries that seek to capitalize on civilian casualties to demonstrate their strength, when, in fact, what it illustrates is that they are cowards.\nWhat is true is we're talking about technology and a capability that in many cases in unique to the United States. But I think what is also true is that we are going to greater lengths in our commitment to transparency when disclosing this kind of information is also unique to the United States. And it's something that the President believes builds a lot of credibility into our broader national security efforts, but also adds credibility to our efforts to go after terrorists.\nI think I would just add that none of this capacity would exist and it would not be used so effectively were it not for the skill, professionalism and courage of our national security professionals. These are men and women who do not seek the spotlight. These are men and women who, in some cases, even when we are trying to be as transparent as possible, we're not able to discuss them or their activities. But as we prepare to enter the Fourth of July weekend, I think it merits at least some time spent to expressing our deep appreciation for their courage and their professionalism and their patriotism in keeping our country safe. And it has been patriots like these individuals over the course of generations that have allowed us to establish the greatest country on Earth.\nQ: Last one, for me. Did the President have an occasion to speak with the Attorney General since the much talked-about meeting with former President Clinton? Has he had a conversation with her? I know that she's made public comments. I presume you watched them this morning, as well. Have they had a phone call?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any conversations that they've had in the last couple of days.\nMichelle.\nQ: Do you agree with the Attorney General that having that meeting was not a good idea now?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not going to second-guess or offer my own backseat driving here. I'll let the Attorney General speak to her schedule and to her handling of the significant responsibilities that she has.\nQ: Even though she's come out and said it? I mean, she just said that she would not do this again because of the shadow that is cast. I mean, isn't that something that the White House agrees with now that this has turned into a couple of days of debate over --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again I will let the Attorney General speak to that.\nQ: It is a question of judgment, though, isn't it? And the decision to sit down for that 30 minutes or however long it was. Isn't that something that you would be concerned about -- the judgment and what it leads to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think when it comes to judgment, I think there is no quarreling with the 30-year history that Loretta Lynch has established as a highly competent, highly successful federal prosecutor. She is somebody who has prosecuted Democratic and Republican public officials for corruption. She is somebody who has broken up organized crime rings. She is somebody who has held accountable some of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street to make sure that the interest of middle-class families are protected.\nShe did that work as the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, and that's work that's she's continued to do even as the Attorney General, both in terms of fighting corruption in the most powerful, international, athletic institution in the world, as well as continuing the important work to fight Medicare fraud and make sure that taxpayer dollars that are dedicated to the health and wellbeing of our senior citizens is wisely spent and that unscrupulous administrators, scammers aren't able to get away with it.\nSo she is somebody who is remarkably tenacious. She is somebody who handles her responsibilities consistent with the values that are enshrined in our Constitution, and consistent with the President's expectations about what the Attorney General of the United States should do.\nQ: Do you also then not quarrel with her saying that that was a bad idea?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'll let her render her own judgment on that.\nQ: Okay. And on the drone report -- even before it comes out, even before we see any numbers, some groups are questioning how those numbers would be arrived at, since, in the past, estimates on the ground or from NGOs are larger. So what would you say about the effort that was made to find out really how many were killed recently?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the goal of being as transparent as possible is to settle on numbers that are as accurate as possible. And I'll let the Director of National Intelligence discuss how exactly the numbers that they present were arrived at. And once they've had an opportunity to do that, everyone will have an opportunity to evaluate how successful these kinds of operations are.\nQ: Do you acknowledge, though, that there's a possibility that this number -- whatever it will be -- wasn't able to account for every death? I'm assuming there's some threshold of verifiability that --\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let the Director of National Intelligence speak to this, because these are numbers that they have worked up.\nQ: So is it possible that the actual number would be higher than these numbers?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'll let the Director of National Intelligence speak to it.\nAlex.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said you feel confident that the President feels that this investigation of Attorney General Lynch to Secretary Clinton's emails should be handled without regard to politics. But doesn't her announcement this morning mean that politics did rear its head here?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think so. I think -- again, the President continues to believe that it is critically important for people across the country to continue to have confidence in our justice system at large. And for generations, our country has followed a tradition, makings sure that our justice system is not used to benefit or exact revenge against American citizens based on their political affiliation.\nA core principle of the United States Constitution is that the rule of law is paramount and that everyone, including the President of the United States, is subject to the rule of law, and that people are treated, under the law, the same -- regardless of whether they're famous, regardless of who their supporters are, regardless of which political party that they're in. And this is an important principle, one that the President believes is worth fighting for. His Attorney General has said the same thing, and we continue to be confident that that's what she'll do. What exactly her role is in that process or what exactly the process will be as it's implemented by the Department of Justice is something that they should answer.\nQ: So is it in the White House's view that her announcement this morning was in any way related to the airplane meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let -- well, look, I think it's pretty obvious that that's exactly what she was discussing today. But again, I'll let her words speak for themselves.\nQ: Okay, and then on Zika. We did a poll earlier this week where 73 percent of the public said that they're okay with the level of the administration's funding proposal. But only 46 percent said that it should be approved immediately. Does the administration feel that they could have pitched this any differently to instill this kind of urgency into the public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Alex, I think this is the kind of question that, frankly, should be quite a bit more important than politics. What we have here is a public health emergency. And that's not just -- that's not a phrase that I'm using by accident, or even a phrase that I have coined. This is what our top public health professionals say about the situation. And this is an emergency that the President and these public health officials identified five months ago.\nAnd over the course of that time, we've seen very little movement from the United States Congress. And this does raise significant questions about the Republican leadership in Congress. Republicans spent hundreds of millions of dollars, spent days and days, if not weeks or months, on the campaign trail making the case to the American public about why they deserve to wield the authority that's exercised by the majority in Congress.\nNow, presumably they did that because they had an agenda they wanted to advance. There's very little evidence that they have an agenda, or that they've succeeded in advancing it -- to the extent that it even exists. But it also -- we can have that discussion if you'd like. I would like to. But I'll leave it up to you guys to decide that.\nThat also comes with an important set of responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is making sure that our country's and our government's top health care professionals have the tools and resources that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people, including our most vulnerable populations, like pregnant women and newborn children.\nAnd Republicans in Congress have utterly failed to fulfill that responsibility. I don't know exactly how they're going to account for that. But they certainly do have some explaining to do. And I won't be surprised if it is the subject of some discussion across the country while they're enjoying their Fourth of July recess. The President certainly feels a sense of urgency about this, and I think that's why you heard the President say earlier today that before Congress embarks on their nearly two-month-long summer recess, that they will fulfill this responsibility.\nSo the President has had some conversations with congressional leaders in the last 24 hours about this. I would anticipate that he'll have some additional conversations with congressional leaders in the days ahead. But the responsibility rests with Congress. This administration has put forward a very specific proposal based on the recommendations the President has received from top public health professionals. That is the proposal that we forwarded to Congress more than four months ago. It's time for Republicans in Congress to fulfill their responsibility and make sure that our public health professionals have the resources that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, the Pentagon yesterday lifted the ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces. Did the White House have a hand in moving forward with that? Or was that completely internal at the Pentagon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, as you know, this is something that Secretary of Defense Carter decided to review. He announced a few months ago that he wanted to take a look at this policy. At that point, he had described the policy as outdated. So he conducted this review consistent with the priority that he has placed on making sure that our Department of Defense and our armed forces are ready and well-prepared to defend the country.\nHe's come to the conclusion that the best way to do that is to update this outdated policy. This was a review that he conducted on his own. This is a decision that he made, but it's certainly one that is supported by the Commander-in-Chief.\nQ: Even though the President supports it, it sounds like he didn't have a specific role in moving forward with the decision to pull the trigger on (inaudible) transgender service yesterday. Is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the Secretary of Defense had the responsibility, and assumed the responsibility to conduct this review. Obviously, the President and the Secretary of Defense have had an opportunity to discuss it. But this is a review that was conducted by the Secretary of Defense, and he did so focused on the priority that he places on military readiness. And he made an observation that is consistent with the President's view, which is that our country and our military is best served when everybody who is qualified to serve in our military has an opportunity to do so.\nThat means that our military can draw on the rich diversity of this country, on the skills of everybody in this country to protect it. And we should be giving everybody who has a talent or a skill and a commitment to this country the opportunity to use it in service to this country in the military if they're qualified to do so.\nQ: Because the change is regulatory, a future administration hostile to transgender military service could reverse it. Does the change yesterday underscore the risks to LGBT rights in the upcoming election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let individual voters make their own determinations about this. The President and the Secretary of Defense agree on this principle. And both men certainly believe that it enhances our national security to live up to this principle. So, frankly, this is not a decision that's rooted in politics. This is rooted in a decision, something more important, which is the national security of the United States.\nQ: Also, on Thursday, a judge enjoined the enforcement of that Mississippi religious freedom law seen to enable sweeping anti-LGBT discrimination. The Obama administration was reviewing that law. Is that review now on hold as a result of the judge's order?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, this individual law is subject to ongoing litigation. So I'm somewhat limited in what I can say about it. What I can just say in general is that these types of laws raise a number of difficult legal and policy questions. And what happens in the courts in these cases will obviously inform our assessment of these laws and their implications.\nSpeaking more generally, you've heard the President say on a number of occasions that he pretty strongly disagrees with laws that are focused on taking away the rights of law-abiding Americans. The truth is we should be a little more focused on protecting the rights and expanding the rights, and enhancing the rights of law-abiding Americans. And that is a principle that the President has been guided by throughout his tenure in public service. It's also been a principle that has guided his assessment of laws that are passed at the state and local level, as well.\nQ: Another anti-LGBT law, much like the one you just spoke about, is on the books in North Carolina. Will President Obama speak out on his previously stated opposition to that law in Charlotte next week and urge voters to keep that in mind when they head to the polls in November?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't have detailed remarks to preview for you at this point. But I can tell you that the focus of the President's remarks in Charlotte will be on Secretary Clinton, and his view that she has the character, the toughness, skills and experience to succeed him as President of the United States.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, ahead of the press being briefed today, were the leaders of the countries where these done strikes took place briefed? Or were they involved in any kind of weighing in on these disclosures?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there are significant diplomatic implications for this kind of transparency. And that certainly goes to I think the legitimate questions that Mark was raising about how challenging it is to be transparent when you're dealing with matters that are as sensitive as this one. But I can tell you that there certainly was a diplomatic effort to communicate with our allies and partners about this information.\nQ: Did they in any way get to weigh in, for lack of a better term? Was this a two-way communication, given how sensitive it is, given oftentimes countries don't really want to be acknowledging that America is bombing their own citizens?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is we certainly are going to factor in concerns that are raised by our allies, particularly our closest partners. But I'm not able to speak to the substance of any individual conversations that the United States had with our counterparts around the world. The State Department may be able to provide you some additional insight on that. But I haven't been briefed on any individual conversations.\nQ: But it's safe to say that the architecture that the administration is trying to shape here, that you're talking about, took some of that into consideration? Or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, sure, we certainly are aware of the way that these kinds of operations have an impact on our diplomatic relations. And when we're talking about countries that are either allies or close partners of the United States, then their opinion matters.\nBut the architecture that we have established is one that is consistent with our national security interests and consistent with our values. And this is something that was the result of a lot of painstaking policy work that's been done over the last seven years.\nAnd again, the President inherited this powerful tool that we were just beginning to understand and our national security professionals were just beginning to understand how powerful it is and what the consequences of its use could be. So I bring this up not to criticize the previous administration, but rather to illustrate how dramatically our counterterrorism capacity has been enhanced over the last seven or eight years. And that has challenged our policy process to ensure that that new and highly effective tool is effectively used consistent with our national security objectives, but also consistent with our values. And that's the work that's been underway for quite some time. And that is something that -- the establishment of this architecture is something that the next President will benefit from.\nQ: Any chance that we get similar disclosures on one of the other powerful tools -- cyber?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that is a different policy area but I think is another example of the way our nation's capabilities and vulnerabilities have developed. And there is a similar set of questions that could be asked about this policy area, too. I think what I would say about that is that when it comes to cybersecurity and our cyber capabilities, and the policymaking around that, it's not as developed as these questions about our counterterrorism capabilities. But there certainly is appropriate time and attention that's focused on them as well.\nQ: Quickly -- the President heads to NATO next week. Vladimir Putin today saying he wants to start a dialogue with NATO, even though they're creeping so close to Russian borders. Are there any plans to sort of change the agenda or have any kind of outreach to Russia as the President heads to NATO?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any conversations in the NATO context that are planned with Russia. But look, what is true is that the United States has a wide-ranging and extraordinarily complex relationship with Russia. And we've talked about, at various times in this briefing room, about the way that we have been able to successfully work together, for example, to isolate North Korea, to eliminate chemical weapons from Syria, and even to reach an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nEach of these things are priorities. Each of these things have significant consequences for the national security of the United States. And in each instance we have been able to coordinate effectively with the Russians to advance our shared interests. Now, there have been a variety of situations in which our interests are not shared, in which we have had significant concerns with Russian behavior, particularly as it relates to the situation in Ukraine, which is a subject of heightened concern in Europe.\nLet me get around to my point here, which is simply that the United States and even NATO will continue to have an open line of dialogue with Russia about a wide range of issues. But what's also true is the United States and our alliance with NATO is critical to our national security. And the United States has been looking for ways to invest more deeply and deepen our cooperation with our NATO allies. And that will be the subject of discussion when the President travels to Poland next week.\nQ: And you said nothing planned in terms of speaking to Russia about this proposal for dialogue, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I didn't see exactly what Putin was -- or what President Putin was suggesting, so it's making it a little hard to answer your question. But in the context of the NATO Summit, I'm not aware of any specific of prominent Russian role or negotiation that will be started.\nQ: And lastly, Attorney General Lynch joked that she wished she knew where the lock on the plane door was in hindsight.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see that part of her discussion.\nQ: She said she wished Eric Holder had given her the scoop on that.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, I see.\nQ: It was a joking comment, but is it one that you would agree with?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let her speak to that particular situation. I wasn't there, so I'll let her describe exactly what happened and what she thinks about.\nQ: It would suggest that she was an unwilling recipient of the guest who boarded her plane.\nMR. EARNEST: That is what it suggests. But again, if that's what she intended, you should ask her.\nVictoria.\nQ: Will the drone strike report contain a definition of what a civilian is?\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned.\nQ: So, human rights groups are saying that the U.S. has changed its definition of what a civilian is over the past several years. Can you confirm that?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't. I'll let you all have an opportunity to take a close look at it -- close look at these materials for yourself. That's the point of this whole exercise here.\nQ: Will that be in there, or won't it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Whether the U.S. has changed its definition of what a civilian is over the seven years that this report covers, will that be in there?\nMR. EARNEST: Take a look at the report when it's released, and I'll let you evaluate that for yourself.\nQ: Because changing the definition of what a civilian is will --\nMR. EARNEST: Victoria, I think you know what we're doing here.\nQ: I do. But it would seriously impact the numbers of those --\nMR. EARNEST: And my point is, you'll have an opportunity to take a look at it.\nNadia.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I came a bit late, so I don't know if you answered this question. But, on Syria, did the President sign on that plan that will further cooperate militarily with Russia to target the al Nusra Front in Syria? And how does this benefit the moderate opposition that you're supporting? And I'm referring, of course, to The Washington Post article that I don't know if you're familiar with.\nMR. EARNEST: I did. I talked about this a little bit yesterday, actually. It has not come up today. So our position from yesterday has not changed, but let me describe to you just a little bit about what our view is here.\nWe've been saying -- and I think you and I have had this conversation -- we've been saying for quite some time that the United States would welcome a more effective and more constructive contribution from the Russians to our counter-ISIL coalition. The United States and our 65 or 66 partners have been very focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. And we would welcome any available assistance that Russia is prepared to offer. The reason that they haven't is that they have prioritized shoring up the Assad regime over going after extremists. And the problem with that is that represents a fundamental contradiction in their strategy -- that by shoring up the Assad regime they only prolong the kind of political chaos inside of Syria, they exacerbate the violence inside of Syria that makes for a more hospitable environment for a terrorist organization like ISIL.\nSo the case that we've been making to the Russians that even predates their military intervention in Syria is essentially twofold: focus your efforts on ISIL and work with us to do it, and use your political influence with the Assad regime to get them to engage in the kinds of talks that will lead to a political transition inside of Syria. This is a political transition, by the way, that even President Putin acknowledges is necessary for addressing the many problems plaguing Syria.\nBut even though they have acknowledged that that transition is necessary, they continue to shore up the Assad regime. Again, it's difficult -- there's such a clear contradiction there, it's difficult to explain exactly what their intentions are.\nSo the case that we continue to make to the Russians -- again, this is one that predates even their military intervention in Syria, but one that we continue to make is let's focus on the Cessation of Hostilities. Let's make sure that every signatory to the Cessation of Hostilities -- and that includes both the Russians and the regime -- should live up to those commitments. And that will nurture the fledgling political talks that we've been trying to get going. And when I say \"we,\" I actually mean the international community, because it's the United Nations that's facilitating them.\nAnd if Russia is concerned about the threat that is posed by extremists in Syria, then they should be focused on trying to hasten those political negotiations. And if they want to take military action, then they should work with us to target ISIL and other extremists that are capitalizing on the chaos inside of Syria.\nQ: So for all these reasons that you just mentioned, you obviously don't have much faith in the Russians. So are you disputing the fact that -- not fact, but disputing the report that is saying that the President has signed on to this plan?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I am disputing the nature of the report. That's not true. But what I'm trying to illustrate here is the context of the case that we made to the Russians. And in some ways -- you described it as not having faith in the Russians -- I think there are a lot of reasons for us to be somewhat distrustful of them, but that's not really the question here. The question here is about this fundamental contradiction in their strategy that they have thus far refused to address. And that simply is, as long as you're shoring up the ability of the Assad regime to remain in power, you're just prolonging the chaos, you're exacerbating the violence, and pushing a solution off further into the distance.\nAnd so that's been -- again, I think no surprise -- a subject of some consternation on the part of the United States and the rest of the international community. And so our case to President Putin and to the Russian government is that if they're willing to capitalize on the opportunities that exist, for them to use their influence with the Assad regime, then we can actually make some more progress in trying to address the situation.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, back on the Attorney General. Can you say why President Obama didn't avail himself of the opportunity yesterday that the pool gave him to comment on it? They asked several questions but he wouldn't have any of it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think some of that is -- I think it's rooted in two things. The first is that the President's views on the importance of investigations handled by the Department of Justice being free of political influence are quite well known. This is a topic that he has addressed on a number of occasions. I think that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is, it undermines -- or at least has the potential to undermine -- that independence if the President is weighing in on this at every opportunity. So there are some times when the President is asked a direct question, as he has been in a number of interviews or news conferences where the President has answered the question. And in each case, I think the President has made clear that he believes in the importance of these investigations being handled independently and free of any sort of political interference. So those, frankly, are situations in which he can't avoid the question, but yesterday was a scenario in which he could avoid the question and so he did.\nQ: Did he not think questions on that matter were appropriate, as you indicated they were yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, no -- I don't recall the President ever suggesting that somehow it's inappropriate for somebody to ask him. I just think that, again, given how well-known his views are on this topic, I think he decided to pass up the opportunity.\nQ: And on your comment earlier about not wanting to ruin our afternoon by bringing the President out, can I invite you to ruin away?\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) I know, Mark, that you, in particular, like to start your weekend rather early on Friday afternoons.\nQ: Thanks for looking out. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'm just teasing.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, yesterday the State Department issued its report on human trafficking and it put Myanmar in the same category as Iran, North Korea and Syria. This is a country the President has visited twice and with which his administration reopened diplomatic ties. I'm wondering whether you can tell me -- is the President disappointed by the evidence of backsliding in Myanmar? And what does it say about the future of the relationship between our two countries?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has made nurturing political reform inside of Burma a national security priority. And we certainly are pleased with the progress that Burma has made just over the last several years in making some fundamental changes to the way that country is governed in a way that has benefits for the citizens of that country and for the broader region.\nAt the same time, and I think at every turn, the President has made clear that the journey on which they have embarked will be a long one. And there is a lot more progress that we would like to see the government of Burma make when it comes to protecting the universal human rights of their people. So I think what you're underscoring, Mark, is the fact that they've got a lot more work to do. I don't think that even when he has been on Burmese soil the President has not papered over that priority; he's acknowledged it.\nAnd, in fact, I think he has made the case that the government doing a better job of protecting the basic universal human rights of their people will actually strengthen their country and strengthen their democracy. And I think that was a pretty powerful signal for the President of the United States to travel to Burma and make that case rather directly. So there's no denying that the government of Burma has a lot of work to do, but there's also no denying the remarkable progress that they've made in a rather short period of time.\nAngela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The situation in the UK of choosing its next prime minister seems to have evolved very quickly in the last couple days. And some of the leading candidates now are talking about a lack of urgency in executing Brexit. Does the President want to see a new prime minister in the UK who might want to slow-walk that process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that the President's -- I think the views that the President has expressed on this matter are irrespective of who succeeds David Cameron at Number 10. The President believes that the UK and the EU should negotiate with one another and establish an orderly and transparent process for removing the UK from the EU. And it will be up to those two entities to carry out those negotiations. Obviously the United States is going to continue to maintain our strong relationship with both parties, but ultimately those kinds of decisions need to be made by leaders in the EU and the UK.\nQ: I guess what I'm trying to get at is, does the U.S. have a stake in the pace of that process? You want it to be orderly and transparent, but should that happen at a sooner date or a later date? How does that play into the President's thinking on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding is that the way that the EU charter has been written is that it essentially establishes a process that could take up to two years once Article 50 has been invoked. So there is a -- this is time-bound a little bit, based on the rules and regulations of the EU. But, look, whether it ends up actually taking two years to complete that process is something that will be determined in talks between the EU and leaders in the UK.\nQ: And then one other topic. There's been some in-fighting this week among the Clinton and Sanders camps as the Democratic Party works on its platform that will be approved at the convention in a few weeks. Is the President concerned about this intraparty squabble over what should be in the platform? And what are his priorities for the platform?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think the President is particularly concerned about it, in large part because the President has been through a process, back in 2008, of working to unify the Democratic Party after a competitive primary campaign. And I think the President has been pleased thus far with the good-faith effort that leaders in the party have made to unify the party. I think they're an indication of how leaders in the Democratic Party understand the stakes in the upcoming presidential election.\nI think all of this is being done with a healthy amount of respect for Democratic voters. And I think people at all levels in the Democratic Party have an interest in making sure that our party platform reflects the diversity and diversity of views that are in our party. And the President continues to have confidence that as that process plays out, that the result will reflect that priority.\nFrancesca, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. I have a few questions, but we'll stay on the Democratic Convention for the moment.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: How involved is the President and the White House in the convention itself and the platform and all that? Is that really more Secretary Clinton's team, or is the White House heavily involved?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this is almost entirely the responsibility of the Democratic National Committee. The DNC does now bear the imprint of the presumptive nominee, so that's where those decisions are made.\nQ: Well, how involved will the President be? I mean, obviously he will give a speech at some point during the convention, the Vice President as well. Is he doing anything more than that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't anticipate that the President will be doing a lot more than that.\nQ: Okay. Staying on the topic of Secretary Clinton, how frequently can we expect the President to be out there campaigning with her before November?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen I don't have an update on the President's schedule at this point. The President has indicated a desire -- I think those of you who have watched some of his public appearances over the last six weeks or so have recognized that he is quite eager to make a public case about the path that his successor should follow.\nSo it's hard for me to say at this point exactly how many days a week the President will be engaged in political activity. My sense is, is that over the summer I do not anticipate that there would be extensive political travel, but once the general election is fully engaged and as the attention of the country begins to focus on the presidential election, the President's opportunity to make a visible case for Secretary Clinton will increase.\nQ: Okay. Last one on a completely different topic. Going back to NATO -- Donald Trump, he said that it's going to have to be readjusted to take care of terrorism, or we're going to set up a new coalition, a new group of countries to handle terrorism because terrorism is out of control. And so with the NATO Summit coming up next week, is it on the President's agenda to put in a new request for NATO to fully join the ISIS coalition -- the coalition against ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: What is true is that the United States benefits enormously from the commitment that our allies have made to our NATO coalition -- to our NATO alliance. Many of our NATO allies are also active participants and contributors to our counter-ISIL coalition. And the President has been appreciative of the contributions that our partners and allies around the world have made to our counter-ISIL coalition, but he believes that there is more that can be done both in terms of committing military resources, but also in committing financial resources to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.\nIn some cases, that means offering that military and financial support to the central government of Iraq as they work to rebuild those communities that have been retaken from ISIL. In other cases, that means making substantial and important contributions to international relief organizations that are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the millions of people who have been displaced by the violence in Syria.\nSo there are a lot of ways for people to participate. We certainly have been deeply appreciative of the important contributions that have been made thus far, including by so many of our NATO allies. But we surely believe that there is more that can be done.\nQ: So he does think it should be readjusted to focus more on terrorism -- the President -- or he doesn't?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, NATO has a fundamental place when it comes to our national security, and NATO has performed a variety of functions, including in Afghanistan. And we certainly have welcomed the important contribution that our NATO allies have made to our efforts in Afghanistan. There are also some significant challenges that Europe is dealing with, and there is a potential that NATO resources could be used to confront some of those challenges, particularly as it relates to the migration situation there.\nBut NATO is primarily a defensive alliance. And the goal is to unify these North Atlantic countries in pursuit of our collective self-defense. So that contribution has been valuable to the United States and to our national security. Certainly countries throughout Europe have benefitted from that alliance. And the President's goal is to look for ways to strengthen that alliance and further deepen our cooperation with our allies on the other side of the Atlantic.\nQ: Josh, just quickly on a developing terrorist potential situation in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It's ongoing, so I just want to know if the President has been briefed on this. Do you have anything for us on this? It's happening right now in the diplomatic quarters there.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of this particular situation, but we'll see what we can learn and let you know if and when the President has been briefed.\nI'll just do week-ahead before we adjourn here.\nOn Monday, the President and the First Lady will celebrate the Fourth of July, as they always, do by hosting military heroes and their families for an Independence Day celebration, with a barbecue, a concert, and a view of the fireworks on the South Lawn of the White House. White House staff and their families from throughout the administration will also attend this event for the fireworks viewing. There will also be a performance on Monday evening by fellow Kansas Citian, Janelle Monбe, and Kendrick Lamar.\nOn Tuesday, the President will travel to Charlotte, North Carolina for a \"Hillary for America\" campaign event. Additional details on the President's travel to North Carolina will be available in the days ahead.\nOn Wednesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\nOn Thursday, the President will travel to Warsaw, Poland, to attend the 2016 NATO Summit. It will be the President's fifth and final summit with NATO leaders. The meeting will afford an opportunity to underscore alliance solidarity, to advance efforts to bolster security to NATO's East and South, and to project stability through new partnerships beyond the North Atlantic area.\nOn Friday, the President will meet with the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission to discuss U.S.-EU cooperation across a range of shared priorities, including countering terrorism, fostering economic growth and prosperity, and addressing the global refugee crisis. Afterward, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg.\nOn Friday afternoon, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with President Duda of Poland to discuss U.S.-Polish relations, reaffirm the American commitment to Poland's security, and exchange views on the broader security environment in Europe. Afterward, the President will participate in a NATO family photo and attend a NATO session on the NATO Alliance Council.\nOn Friday evening -- a rather long day -- the President will participate in a family photo and attend a working dinner with NATO leaders.\nThe President will spend Friday night in Warsaw, Poland.\nOn Saturday, the President will attend a NATO session on Afghanistan, followed by a session of the North Atlantic Council. In the afternoon, he'll participate in a session of the NATO-Ukraine Commission before convening a news conference that evening.\nAfter the news conference, the President will depart Warsaw, Poland and travel to Seville, Spain. The visit to Spain, an important NATO ally, will highlight robust security cooperation, a strong political and economic relationship, and longstanding people-to-people ties. The President will spend Saturday night in Seville.\nAnd we'll have more details about the President's trip in the coming days.\nQ: Is Thursday a travel day, or is there NATO action on Thursday?\nMR. EARNEST: Thursday is just a travel day. The excitement of NATO will begin on Friday.\nThanks, everybody. Have a very happy Fourth of July.\nEND 1:32 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118123", "text": "Since President Obama took office, he has been clear that, when necessary, the United States will use force abroad to protect the American people consistent with our values and all applicable law, including the law of armed conflict. He has also emphasized the need to be as transparent as possible with the American people about the basis for our counterterrorism operations and the manner in which they are conducted in order to enhance the public's confidence in these activities, set standards for other nations to follow, and counter terrorist propaganda and false accusations about U.S. operations. Additionally, the President has underscored that we will continue to develop a sustainable legal and policy architecture to guide our counterterrorism activities going forward. To these ends, in 2013 the President approved and publicly described policy guidance formalizing and strengthening the rigorous standards and procedures governing our use of lethal force against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities. Today, the Administration is taking additional steps to institutionalize and enhance best practices regarding U.S. counterterrorism operations and other U.S. operations involving the use of force, as well as to provide greater transparency and accountability regarding these operations.\nThese steps include promulgating an Executive Order on United States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of Force, as well as releasing aggregate data regarding both the number of strikes undertaken during this Administration by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets located outside areas of active hostilities[1] and the range of assessed combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes. The Executive Order provides additional information on best practices and procedures that are already in place for current operations and that will be applied in future operations, regardless of the location. Collectively, these measures demonstrate the professionalism and high standards employed by U.S. Government personnel who help keep Americans safe from terrorist threats overseas, while also underscoring our commitment to constantly refine and strengthen our counterterrorism framework and enhance accountability for our actions.\nExecutive Order to Address Civilian Casualties\nAs President Obama has said, \"All armed conflict invites tragedy. But by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life.\" In that spirit, this Executive Order applies to all of our operations, regardless of where they are conducted, and underscores that our legal and policy commitments regarding the protection of civilians are fundamentally consistent with the effective, efficient, and decisive use of force in pursuit of our Nation's interests.\nFirst, this Executive Order catalogues the best practices the U.S. Government currently implements to protect civilians in the context of operations involving the use of force inside and outside areas of active hostilities, and it directs relevant departments and agencies to sustain such measures in present and future operations. These measures include conducting training on implementation of best practices that help reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties and dedicating operational resources to mitigate that risk. It also includes, as appropriate, maintaining channels for engagement with the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations that can assist in efforts to distinguish between military objectives and civilians; acknowledging U.S. Government responsibility for civilian casualties and offering condolences, including ex gratia payments, to civilians who are injured, or to the families of civilians who are killed; and, when civilian casualties have occurred, taking steps to minimize the likelihood of future such incidents.\nSecond, to help address challenges associated with assessing the credibility of reports of civilian casualties in non-permissive environments, the Executive Order emphasizes the U.S. Government's consideration of credible reporting provided by non-governmental organizations in its post-strike reviews, including drawing on existing information-sharing arrangements to ensure the availability of such reporting to those conducting post-strike analyses.\nThird, it directs the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), or such other officials as the President may designate, to release publicly an annual summary of information obtained from relevant departments and agencies about the number of strikes undertaken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities and the assessed range of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes, based on relevant and credible post-strike reporting and consistent with the need to protect sources and methods. The annual report will also include information regarding the general sources of information and methodology used to conduct these assessments and address general reasons for discrepancies between post-strike assessments by the U.S. Government and credible reporting from non-governmental organizations.\nFinally, the Executive Order establishes a mechanism for experts from relevant U.S. Government departments and agencies to convene to consult on civilian casualty trends and consider potential improvements to the U.S. Government's civilian casualty mitigation efforts.\nBackground on Processes and Procedures Taken by the U.S. Government to Mitigate Civilian Casualties\nIn May 2013, President Obama issued Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG) that, among other things, set forth policy standards for U.S. direct action outside the United States and outside areas of active hostilities. These policy standards generally include that the United States will use lethal force only against a target that poses a \"continuing, imminent threat to U.S. persons,\" and that direct action will be taken only if there is \"near certainty\" that the terrorist target is present and \"near certainty\" that non-combatants will not be killed or injured. As the President has said, the \"near certainty\" standard is the \"highest standard we can set.\"\nThus, unlike terrorist organizations, which deliberately target civilians and violate the law of armed conflict, the United States takes great care to adhere to the law of armed conflict and, in many circumstances, applies policy standards that offer protections for civilians that exceed the requirements of the law of armed conflict. Moreover, even when the United States is not operating under the PPG - for example, when the United States is taking action in \"areas of active hostilities,\" such as it is today in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, or when the United States is acting quickly to defend U.S. or partner forces from attack - the United States goes to extraordinary lengths to minimize the risk of civilian casualties.\nIn particular, in dealing with enemy forces that do not wear uniforms or carry their arms openly, the United States goes to great lengths to apply the fundamental law of armed conflict principle of distinction, which, among other things, requires that attacks be directed only against military objectives and not against civilians and civilian objects. The United States considers all available information about a potential target's current and historical activities to inform an assessment of whether the individual is a lawful target. For example, an individual may be targetable if the individual is formally or functionally a member of an armed group against which we are engaged in an armed conflict. As Administration officials have stated publicly, to determine if an individual is a member of an armed group, we may look to, among other things: the extent to which the individual performs functions for the benefit of the group that are analogous to those traditionally performed by members of a country's armed forces; whether that person is carrying out or giving orders to others within the group; or whether that person has undertaken certain acts that reliably connote meaningful integration into the group.\nBefore a strike against a terrorist target is considered in any theater, U.S. Government personnel review all available information to determine whether any of the individuals at the location of the potential strike is a non-combatant. A body of standards, methods, techniques, and computer modeling, supported by weapons testing data and combat observations, informs the analysis as to whether those not specifically targeted would likely be injured or killed in a strike.\nReleasing Aggregate Data on Strikes Undertaken by the U.S. Government Against Terrorist Targets Outside Areas of Active Hostilities\nDemonstrating the legitimacy of our counterterrorism efforts requires not only complying with the law of armed conflict and setting policy standards that offer protection that exceeds the law's requirements, but also providing information to the American people about our counterterrorism efforts. As President Obama has said, when we cannot explain our efforts clearly and publicly, we face terrorist propaganda and international suspicion, we erode the legitimacy of our actions in the eyes of our partners and our people, and we undermine accountability in our own government. That is why the President believes it is important to provide the public with as much information as possible regarding the basis for and results of U.S. counterterrorism operations. In keeping with this commitment, today the DNI is releasing a summary of information obtained from relevant departments and agencies about both the number of strikes undertaken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities between January 20, 2009, and December 31, 2015, and the best assessed range of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes. Going forward, figures for the preceding year will be released annually on May 1, consistent with the need to protect sources and methods.\nWe recognize that U.S. counterterrorism strikes have killed non-combatants, a reality that exists in all conflicts. As the statement today from the DNI notes, in releasing these figures, the U.S. Government also acknowledges that there are differences between U.S. Government assessments and reporting from non-governmental organizations on non-combatant deaths resulting from U.S. operations. Although the U.S. Government has access to a wide range of information, the figures we are releasing today should be considered in light of the inherent limitations on the ability to determine the precise number of combatant and non-combatant deaths outside areas of active hostilities, including the non-permissive environments in which these strikes often occur. But as the information we are releasing also shows, the rigorous standards and procedures we apply to such strikes have resulted in extraordinarily precise targeting. The U.S. Government remains committed to continually refining, clarifying, and strengthening the standards and procedures that govern our use of force abroad to keep the Nation safe from terrorist threats.\n[1] The Administration currently considers Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria to be \"areas of active hostilities.\"", "timestamp": "2016-07-01", "title": "Fact Sheet on Executive Order on the US Policy on Pre & Post-Strike Measures to Address Civilian Casualties in the US Operations Involving the Use of Force & the DNI Release of Aggregate Data on Strike Outside Area of Active Hostilitie"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120960", "text": "First Lady Michelle Obama: For Girls, A Heartbreaking Loss—And An Opportunity\nRalphina Feelee lives in Liberia, where the average family gets by on less than two dollars a day, and many families simply can't afford to educate their daughters. Teen pregnancy rates are high, and pregnant girls are often discouraged from attending school.\nSometimes it's not even safe for girls to attend school in the first place, since their commutes to and from school can be dangerous, and they sometimes even face sexual harassment and assault at school.\nRalphina wakes up early each morning, cooks for her family, cares for her younger siblings, and goes to work at a local market -- all before she even gets to school. But she still attends class each day, working especially hard in science and math so she can fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse.\nRihab Boutadghart lives in a remote part of Morocco near the Sahara Desert. While Morocco has made huge strides in education, and nearly all girls there attend elementary school, girls in rural areas often live far from the nearest middle and high schools, so many of them drop out of school by the time they turn twelve. Right now, only 14 percent of girls in rural Morocco attend high school.\nBut Rihab, who proudly describes herself as a \"feminist,\" is determined to finish her education. She dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and being the CEO of a major company, and she recently appeared on Moroccan TV urging girls to work hard and follow their passions.\nI had the privilege of meeting Ralphina and Rihab earlier this week when I traveled to Liberia and Morocco to highlight our global girls' education crisis -- the fact that right now, more than 62 million girls worldwide are not in school. This is such a heartbreaking loss, because these girls are so bright and so hungry to learn -- and like Ralphina and Rihab, they have such big dreams for themselves. These girls are no less smart or deserving of an education than my own daughters -- or any of our sons and daughters. The only thing that separates them from our children is geography and luck.\nSometimes the issue is resources: their families simply can't afford the school fees; or the nearest school is hours away; or the school nearby doesn't have adequate bathroom facilities for girls, so they're forced to stay home during their menstrual cycles, and they wind up falling behind and dropping out.\nBut often the root of the problem is really about attitudes and beliefs: families and communities simply don't think girls are worthy of an education, and they choose to marry them off as teenagers instead, often forcing them to start having children when they're basically still children themselves.\nThe girls I met in Morocco and Liberia want to be doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs, engineers. One of them wants to run for office so she can fight for women's rights and combat climate change. Another hopes to open her own auto shop to teach women about cars so they can be more independent.\nBut we know that when we give these girls the chance to learn, they will seize it. They'll walk for miles each day to school. They'll study for hours every night by candlelight, determined to learn as much as they possibly can.\nWe know that when we give these girls the chance to learn, they will seize it.\nWe also know that educating girls doesn't just transform their life prospects -- it transforms the prospects of their families, communities, and nations as well. Studies show that girls who are educated earn higher salaries -- 10 to 20 percent more for each additional year of secondary school -- and sending more girls to school and into the workforce can boost an entire country's GDP. Educated girls also marry later, have lower rates of infant and maternal mortality, and are more likely to immunize their children and less likely to contract malaria and HIV.\nThat's why, last year, President Obama and I launched Let Girls Learn, an initiative to help adolescent girls worldwide attend school. And this week, we were proud to announce major new efforts by the U.S. government to promote girls' education in Africa.\nIn Liberia we'll be running girls' empowerment programs, working to end gender violence in schools, and supporting new, second-chance schools for girls who were forced to drop out because of pregnancy or rape.\nIn Morocco we'll be working closely with the Moroccan government to help transform high schools across the country, and we'll be supporting new school dormitories to allow girls from rural areas to attend school far from home.\nLarge scale efforts like these are critically important, and will affect the lives of countless girls, but they're simply not enough. Governments alone cannot solve this problem -- not when we're talking about a number like 62 million.\nThat's why I ended my trip this week in Spain delivering a speech to an audience of young Spanish women. I wanted to make a simple, but urgent point: Every single one of us in countries like Spain and the U.S. has the power -- and the obligation -- to step up as a champion for these girls.\nI told these young women: If you have access to social media, then you have a platform to tell these 62 million girls' stories and raise awareness about the challenges they face. And that's just as true for everyone at home in the U.S. You can go to 62MillionGirls.com right now to find all the information you need to get started and to learn how you can take action to support girls' education efforts across the globe.\nOnce you know these girls' stories, I think you'll find, as I have, that you simply can't walk away from them. After traveling the world as First Lady and meeting so many girls like Ralphina and Rihab, I carry their hopes and their ambitions with me everywhere I go, and I plan to continue my work on their behalf not just for my final seven months as First Lady, but for the rest of my life. I hope you will join me in this mission.", "timestamp": "2016-07-01", "title": "Op-Ed Article by the First Lady on CNN.com"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 10:50 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Anthony S. Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Also participating in the briefing was Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117882", "text": "I just had an opportunity to get the most recent briefing from the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, and NIH about the situation involving Zika. And so I wanted to speak to the press just briefly about it and the American public.\nAs all of you know, there has been an enormous spread of Zika throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, and Puerto Rico. We have not yet seen cases that were transmitted on the continental United States, but we do know that the mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus exist on the continental United States.\nWe also have seen that in Puerto Rico, Zika has spread rapidly. And Dr. Frieden and members of the CDC who have traveled there have seen that the incidence of the cases of Zika—not just among the general population, but among pregnant women—has been spiking. So it is absolutely critical for the United States Government, working in concert with other governments in the hemisphere, to be pushing hard right now to get this situation under control.\nNow, the good news is that for the most part, Zika is not a type of disease like Ebola, where it's life threatening. It is—in some cases, folks may not even have symptoms that are significant. But what we do know is, is that if pregnant women are infected it can have severe consequences for the fetus and a child that's born and has been impacted by the Zika virus.\nSo we have been issuing guidelines in terms of folks who are of childbearing age, who are thinking about starting a family. We know that men can transmit Zika through their semen if they are infected. And so we have issued a range of guidelines about how to approach this problem.\nBut the most important thing that we can do right now is to actually reduce the incidence of Zika. We can issue precautions for travel to areas that have Zika. We can give people guidelines in terms of how to deal with it if they get infected. But this is actually something that we could reduce the risks if Congress does the right thing and allocates the dollars that are needed right now to get the job done.\nIn a briefing by Dr. Fauci, at the NIH, the good news is, is that we feel fairly confident that we can develop a effective vaccine for Zika. And that would help a whole lot of people and allow us to get out in front of this problem before it's in the continental United States. But that requires research money. And in order for a vaccine to be widely available it has to be tested to make sure it's safe; it has to be tested to make sure that it is effective.\nAnd we're beginning right now on a whole bunch of promising pathways to get those tests done so that in fairly short order we might have a vaccine available and people wouldn't have to worry about this. The problem is, right now that that money is stuck in Congress. And we have not seen the House and the Senate come together in a sensible way to put forward the dollars that we have requested that have been budgeted to get the job done.\nSo what I want the American people to understand is that I expect Congress to get this funding done before they leave for vacation, before they adjourn. That's part of their basic responsibility. We put forward a budget request of $1.9 billion. We didn't draw that figure from the clouds; it was based on the assessment of our scientists and our experts in terms of what was going to be needed for basic mosquito abatement and vaccine development and making sure that we've got the proper diagnostic tools so that we can respond effectively to protect the health and safety of the American people.\nAnd that request has been up there for quite some time and has gotten caught up in politics. And we've seen people trying to attach legislation on a bunch of unrelated topics to this funding. It's been politics as usual rather than responding smartly to a very serious public health request.\nSo just to summarize, number one, we have put forward guidelines in terms of travel to areas that have Zika, and we are recommending that pregnant women or women of childbearing years who are thinking about being pregnant or individuals who are traveling to Zika-infected areas, male partners who want to make sure that they're not infecting their spouses or their partners, that they have to take a look and see whether they're traveling in the right places. That's point number one. And you can go to the CDC website in order to find out how you can protect yourself. Stay informed and protect yourself during this summer.\nPoint number two is, we have a crisis right now in Puerto Rico surrounding Zika, and we have to obtain the resources to make sure that we are engaging in mosquito abatement and providing the kind of basic health services to reduce the effects of Zika in Puerto Rico. And at a time when Puerto Rico is already going through a tough time and its public health infrastructure is being strained because of budget constraints and debt problems, it's especially important that we're responsive to the millions of American citizens who live there.\nAnd keep in mind that there's a lot of travel back and forth between Puerto Rico and the continental United States. So this is not something that, ultimately, may end up just being isolated there. That's point number two.\nAnd point number three: We have to get the money from Congress over the next 2 weeks to make sure that we can begin to develop the effective vaccines, the mosquito abatement tools, the State emergency response dollars so that all of us are safe and we're not seeing families dealing with tragedies that can last a lifetime.\nThis is just common sense. And this is not the time to play politics. There are going to be all kinds of negotiations up on Capitol Hill around budget items for the remainder of the year, and that's to be expected; that's what happens during budget negotiations. But when there are emergencies, when there are public health emergencies, when we know that we have the chance to prevent serious tragedies in the lives of families and protect the health and safety of our populations—and particularly our children—then those politics need to be set aside.\nSo Congress should not leave, should not adjourn until they have this done. And I want all the American people to know that we have a chance of developing a vaccine quickly that will help a lot of people as long as Congress, over the next few weeks, does its job. Okay?\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-07-01", "title": "Remarks Following a Briefing on Zika Virus Response and Prevention Efforts"}

Purpose. United States policy on civilian casualties resulting from U.S. operations involving the use of force in armed conflict or in the exercise of the Nation's inherent right of self-defense is based on our national interests, our values, and our legal obligations. As a Nation, we are steadfastly committed to complying with our obligations under the law of armed conflict, including those that address the protection of civilians, such as the fundamental principles of necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality.\nThe protection of civilians is fundamentally consistent with the effective, efficient, and decisive use of force in pursuit of U.S. national interests. Minimizing civilian casualties can further mission objectives; help maintain the support of partner governments and vulnerable populations, especially in the conduct of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations; and enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of U.S. operations critical to our national security. As a matter of policy, the United States therefore routinely imposes certain heightened policy standards that are more protective than the requirements of the law of armed conflict that relate to the protection of civilians.\nCivilian casualties are a tragic and at times unavoidable consequence of the use of force in situations of armed conflict or in the exercise of a state's inherent right of self-defense. The U.S. Government shall maintain and promote best practices that reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties, take appropriate steps when such casualties occur, and draw lessons from our operations to further enhance the protection of civilians.\nSec. 2. Policy. In furtherance of U.S. Government efforts to protect civilians in U.S. operations involving the use of force in armed conflict or in the exercise of the Nation's inherent right of self-defense, and with a view toward enhancing such efforts, relevant departments and agencies (agencies) shall continue to take certain measures in present and future operations.\n(a) In particular, relevant agencies shall, consistent with mission objectives and applicable law, including the law of armed conflict:\n(i) train personnel, commensurate with their responsibilities, on compliance with legal obligations and policy guidance that address the protection of civilians and on implementation of best practices that reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties, including through exercises, pre-deployment training, and simulations of complex operational environments that include civilians;\n(ii) develop, acquire, and field intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems that, by enabling more accurate battlespace awareness, contribute to the protection of civilians; (iii) develop, acquire, and field weapon systems and other technological capabilities that further enable the discriminate use of force in different operational contexts;\n(iv) take feasible precautions in conducting attacks to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties, such as providing warnings to the civilian population (unless the circumstances do not permit), adjusting the timing of attacks, taking steps to ensure military objectives and civilians are clearly distinguished, and taking other measures appropriate to the circumstances; and\n(v) conduct assessments that assist in the reduction of civilian casualties by identifying risks to civilians and evaluating efforts to reduce risks to civilians.\n(b) In addition to the responsibilities above, relevant agencies shall also, as appropriate and consistent with mission objectives and applicable law, including the law of armed conflict:\n(i) review or investigate incidents involving civilian casualties, including by considering relevant and credible information from all available sources, such as other agencies, partner governments, and nongovernmental organizations, and take measures to mitigate the likelihood of future incidents of civilian casualties;\n(ii) acknowledge U.S. Government responsibility for civilian casualties and offer condolences, including ex gratia payments, to civilians who are injured or to the families of civilians who are killed;\n(iii) engage with foreign partners to share and learn best practices for reducing the likelihood of and responding to civilian casualties, including through appropriate training and assistance; and\n(iv) maintain channels for engagement with the International Committee of the Red Cross and other nongovernmental organizations that operate in conflict zones and encourage such organizations to assist in efforts to distinguish between military objectives and civilians, including by appropriately marking protected facilities, vehicles, and personnel, and by providing updated information on the locations of such facilities and personnel.\nSec. 3. Report on Strikes Undertaken by the U.S. Government Against Terrorist Targets Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. (a) The Director of National Intelligence (DNI), or such other official as the President may designate, shall obtain from relevant agencies information about the number of strikes undertaken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, as well as assessments of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes, and publicly release an unclassified summary of such information no later than May 1, 2017. By May 1 of each subsequent year, as consistent with the need to protect sources and methods, the DNI shall publicly release a report with the same information for the preceding calendar year.\n(b) The annual report shall also include information obtained from relevant agencies regarding the general sources of information and methodology used to conduct these assessments and, as feasible and appropriate, shall address the general reasons for discrepancies between post-strike assessments from the U.S. Government and credible reporting from nongovernmental organizations regarding non-combatant deaths resulting from strikes undertaken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities.\n(c) In preparing a report under this section, the DNI shall review relevant and credible post-strike all-source reporting, including such information from nongovernmental sources, for the purpose of ensuring that this reporting is available to and considered by relevant agencies in their assessment of deaths.\n(d) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs may, as appropriate, request that the head of any relevant agency conduct additional reviews related to the intelligence assessments of deaths from strikes against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities.\nSec. 4. Periodic Consultation. In furtherance of the policies and practices set forth in this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, through the National Security Council staff, will convene agencies with relevant defense, counterterrorism, intelligence, legal, civilian protection, and technology expertise to consult on civilian casualty trends, consider potential improvements to U.S. Government civilian casualty mitigation efforts, and, as appropriate, report to the Deputies and Principals Committees, consistent with Presidential Policy Directive 1 or its successor. Specific incidents will not be considered in this context, and will continue to be examined within relevant chains of command.\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) The policies and practices set forth above are not intended to alter, and shall be implemented consistent with, the authority and responsibility of commanders and other U.S. personnel to execute their mission as directed by the President or other appropriate authorities, which necessarily includes the inherent right of self-defense and the maintenance of good order and discipline among U.S. personnel. No part of this order modifies the chain of command of the U.S. Armed Forces or the authority of U.S. commanders.\n(b) No part of this order modifies priorities in the collection of intelligence or the development, acquisition, or fielding of weapon systems and other technological capabilities.\n(c) No part of this order shall prejudice or supplant established procedures pertaining to administrative or criminal investigative or judicial processes in the context of the military justice system or other applicable law and regulation.\n(d) The policies set forth in this order are consistent with existing U.S. obligations under international law and are not intended to create new international legal obligations; nor shall anything in this order be construed to derogate from obligations under applicable law, including the law of armed conflict.\n(e) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nJuly 1, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-07-01", "title": "Executive Order 13732—United States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of Force"}

On Monday, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and I will celebrate the Fourth just like most of you: in the backyard. We'll hang out with family and friends, throw some burgers and dogs on the grill, and watch the fireworks show.\nOf course, we're fortunate enough to have the South Lawn as our backyard. So we're going to fill it with hundreds of our troops, our veterans, and their families. Over the past 7½ years, it's become one of my favorite traditions. We get to celebrate our freedoms while doing what we can to honor all those who serve and sacrifice to make that freedom possible. And I know that honoring our servicemembers, our veterans, and their families is something that so many Americans try to do every day, without fanfare or expectation of anything in return.\nFor the past 5 years, Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden have tried to follow the example of so many of those Americans with their Joining Forces initiative. They've rallied businesses to hire more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses and helped to reduce veteran homelessness. And just this week, Michelle and Jill announced a breakthrough on a concern they've heard again and again from the military spouses they spend so much time with, and that's the issue of professional licensing.\nThis is something that most Americans aren't familiar with. But for military families, it's a big challenge. Here's why. Our troops are often transferred from base to base. It's part of the job. And because their families serve with them, that means their spouses move 10 times more often than the rest of us. Ten times more often. As you might expect, that's tough on a career. And more than one in three of these spouses works in a profession that requires a professional license or certification: nurses, childcare providers, accountants, social workers, and lots of other jobs.\nAnd until recently, when these spouses were asked to move across State lines, they often needed to recertify for a job they're already qualified for. A nurse with years of experience might have to take entry-level courses or pay a fee or wait months for paperwork to be processed before he or she could get back to work on the job they love and that lets them support their families.\nIt didn't make any sense. So we changed it. When Michelle and Jill took up this cause 5 years ago, only three States had taken action on military spouse licensing. But they rallied Governors and State legislatures into action. And this week, we reached a milestone. Today, all fifty States have acted to streamline many of these licensing issues. This is a big step forward, but we're not done yet. We're going to keep working with States to make licensing simpler for more jobs and reach more qualified workers. But we can finally say to so many of our military families, when you move, you'll no longer be forced to put the career you love on hold just because you and your family have chosen to serve this country.\nThat's what this is all about: serving our men and women in uniform as well as they have served us. But you don't have to be a Governor or a First Lady to make a difference. So this holiday weekend, take a look at joiningforces.gov to find out how you can serve the troops, veterans, and military families in your community. And to all our brave men and women in uniform: You represent the best of who we are as a nation. On this day and every day, we thank you.\nHave a great Fourth of July, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-07-02", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Tonight Michelle and I join people across the United States, Israel and around the globe in mourning the loss and celebrating the life of a truly remarkable human being. Like millions of admirers, I first came to know Elie through his account of the horror he endured during the Holocaust simply because he was Jewish. But I was also honored and deeply humbled to call him a dear friend. I'm especially grateful for all the moments we shared and our talks together, which ranged from the meaning of friendship to our shared commitment to the State of Israel.\nElie was not just the world's most prominent Holocaust survivor, he was a living memorial. After we walked together among the barbed wire and guard towers of Buchenwald where he was held as a teenager and where his father perished, Elie spoke words I've never forgotten: \"Memory has become a sacred duty of all people of good will.\" Upholding that sacred duty was the purpose of Elie's life. Along with his beloved wife Marion and the foundation that bears his name, he raised his voice, not just against anti-Semitism, but against hatred, bigotry, and intolerance in all its forms. He implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of \"never again.\"\nAt the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum that he helped create, you can see his words: \"For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.\" But Elie did more than just bear witness, he acted. As a writer, a speaker, an activist, and a thinker, he was one of those people who changed the world more as a citizen of the world than those who hold office or traditional positions of power. His life, and the power of his example, urges us to be better. In the face of evil, we must summon our capacity for good. In the face of hate, we must love. In the face of cruelty, we must live with empathy and compassion. We must never be bystanders to injustice or indifferent to suffering. Just imagine the peace and justice that would be possible in our world if we all lived a little more like Elie Wiesel.\nAt the end of our visit to Buchenwald, Elie said that after all that he and the other survivors had endured, \"We had the right to give up on humanity.\" But he said, \"We rejected that possibility . . . We said, no, we must continue believing in a future.\" Tonight we give thanks that Elie never gave up on humanity and on the progress that is possible when we treat one another with dignity and respect. Our thoughts are with Marion, their son Shlomo Elisha, his stepdaughter Jennifer, and his grandchildren whom we thank for sharing Elie with the world. May God bless the memory of Elie Wiesel, and may his soul be bound up in the bond of eternal life.", "timestamp": "2016-07-02", "title": "Statement on the Death of Eliezer Wiesel"}

For those in our military who could not attend, we just want to say how much we admire, respect, and appreciate everything you do to fight for our freedom every single day.\nAnd obviously, the Fourth of July, we enjoy the hotdogs, we enjoy the burgers, we enjoy the barbecue, we enjoy the day off for a lot of us—[laughter]—we enjoy the fireworks. But it's important to remember what a miracle this country is. How incredible—how incredibly lucky we are that people, generations ago, were willing to take up arms and fight for our freedom. And then, people inside this country understanding that there were imperfections in our Union and were willing to keep on fighting on behalf of extending that freedom to all people and not just some.\nAnd that story of independence is not something that happens and then we just put away. It's something that we have to fight for every single day. It's something that we have to nurture, and we have to spread the word, and we have to work on. And it involves us respecting each other. And it involves us recognizing that there are still people in this country who are going hungry, and they're not free because of that. There are still people in this country who can't find work, and freedom without the ability to contribute to society and put a roof over your head and your—look after your family, that's not yet what we aim for.\nAnd so on a day like this, we celebrate, we have fun, we marvel at everything that's been done before, but we also have to recommit ourselves to making sure that everybody in this country is free, that everybody has opportunity, that everybody gets a fair shot, that we look after all of our veterans when they come home, that we look after our military families and give them a fair shake, that every child has a good education. That is what we should be striving for on Independence Day.\nSo to all of you who are here in this amazing gathering, we love you, and we're grateful that you could join us. To our incredible artists, thank you for always sharing. I've got to tell you—I have to tell you that these two I've gotten a chance to know, and they are both amazing artists and talented and popular and doing great things, but they're also very conscious about their responsibilities and obligations. And they put in a lot of time and effort on behalf of a lot of causes that are important. We're really proud of them for that.\nAnd just because it's a job of a father to embarrass his daughters—[laughter]—I've got one last job. It is—it just so happens that we celebrate our country's birthday on the same day that we celebrate my oldest daughter's birthday. So just a quick happy birthday for Malia.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117848", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Charlotte, North Carolina\n1:54 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One both for what is and has been a highly anticipated visit by the President of the United States on the campaign trail for the first time in 2016. The President is looking forward to the event that he'll do today with Secretary Clinton, and he'll obviously be able to speak for himself about why he is so enthusiastic about her candidacy.\nBut other than that, I'm happy to take whatever questions may be on your mind today. I can only imagine what they are. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, we want to start with Director Comey's announcement. Do you have a reaction? Can you tell us whether or not the White House got a head's up this was coming? And can you tell us whether or not the President has any reservations about endorsing someone who is extremely careless with classified information?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can first confirm what Director Comey said with regard to the White House, which is that no one at the White House received advance notice of his comments. In fact, no one at the White House received advance notice that he was planning to make comments today. So Director Comey, in his statement I saw, confirmed that that applied to the entire federal government. I can certainly vouch for the White House. If you have questions about other government agencies, you can check with them.\nWith regard to the President's support for Secretary Clinton and her presidential campaign, I think you'll hear from him at length today about why he is so enthusiastic about her candidacy and why he believes she would be an excellent 45th President of the United States.\nWith regard to a reaction from the White House, I don't have an official reaction to share. The reason for that is simply that, while the FBI is completing their investigation, the career prosecutors at the Department of Justice still have to make a final determination about how and whether to proceed. And we have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of interfering with this ongoing process. Director Comey himself noted that there was no outside influence brought to bear on this investigation. That certainly is consistent with the effort that we have made to protect the independence of the investigation. It also is consistent with the President's expectations about how any sort of criminal investigation should be conducted -- that is without regard to the political standing or partisan affiliation of anybody involved in the investigation.\nSo given the fact that this matter is still going to be considered by Department of Justice prosecutors, I don't have an official reaction to what Director Comey said today about the FBI's investigation or the recommendation that they're making to those prosecutors.\nQ: Does the President agree that her handling of this material was careless?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, what we're talking about today is an investigation that was conducted by the FBI. This is an investigation that was conducted independent of any outside influence. And again, I think based on what we know from Director Comey's comments, they've looked at this in excruciating detail. So as I alluded to last week, the President's views are irrelevant. The views that matter in this case are the views of the independent FBI investigators that have spent a long time looking into the matter.\nAnd again, with regard to the President's support for her candidacy, he'll talk at length about that today. I think you will find him making a very forceful case about why he believes she should succeed him in the Oval Office, but I'll let him speak to that later today.\nQ: Josh, do you expect him to address the email issue at all during his remarks? And do you expect him to address the overall questions about her trustworthiness that the email issue has fed?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not anticipate that the President will discuss directly the findings and recommendations announced by Director Comey today, but I do anticipate the President will deliver a forceful case about Secretary Clinton's qualifications and values that she'd bring to the job as President of the United States.\nQ: I think we're curious, to the extent that you can help us, about what they're talking about on the flight now, and also whether President Obama has decided only to talk with her about the campaign and governance going forward -- in other words, not to kind of go over these details. They could be on the plane right now talking about what the FBI Director has criticized her for and how he thinks that -- you know, what she shouldn't do if she's President. Maybe they're not doing that, and maybe he's decided that's not going to be his role. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what boundaries he's drawn in terms of how to advise her and what sort of advice is appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I am confident that the President and Secretary Clinton are not discussing the FBI investigation that is being completed. I'm confident that they are not discussing the findings of the investigation that were disclosed by Director Comey today. I'm confident that they are not discussing the recommendation that Director Comey is making to the Department of Justice.\nThe President believes deeply in the principle of keeping independent Department of Justice investigations separate from politics. And that's a principle that the President believes is not just worth upholding, but one that's worth fighting for. On various occasions over the last year, year and a half in which you all have asked me questions about this, I've worked hard to try to make clear how important the principle is. And occasionally that's meant, as recently as today, that there are direct questions that I decline to answer. That also means that there are conversations that the President declines to have because he believes that this is a principle that's worth protecting. I have confidence that Secretary Clinton believes in that principle too. But I'll allow her team to discuss that.\nQ: Did he watch the remarks this morning, though?\nMR. EARNEST: Did I?\nQ: No, did he --\nMR. EARNEST: I did watch the Director's comments today. I don't know whether or not the President did.\nQ: Was the President made aware of those comments? And who briefed him on it? Did the Attorney General brief him? Did Director Comey, after he gave those remarks, brief the President?\nMR. EARNEST: No. And as the Attorney General has said, no one at the White House has received a briefing on this ongoing investigation. And the President has still not received a detailed briefing on this matter from anybody at the Department of Justice. Again, the President all along has believed that it's important for the Department of Justice to conduct their investigation separate from any sort of perceived influence from the White House or anybody else in the federal government.\nSo the President is aware of the news. I don't know whether or not he watched the entirety of the Director's statement in real time.\nQ: In his statement today, Director Comey said that the FBI went through other agencies' email servers to find emails that Secretary Clinton had sent that she hadn't turned over. Did that include any White House emails or even the President's emails? Were they a part of the FBI investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that question. Even if I did know the answer to that question, I don't know that I would be a in a position to discuss it. But let me consult with my colleagues to see if I can get you some kind of an answer to that question.\nQ: So, Josh, you've said a lot of things that they're not discussing today. What are they discussing? Are they discussing Donald Trump? Are they discussing potential running mates for Hillary? And there's some Cabinet members who are on her short list, apparently. He you could give some references, I assume.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they're having a conversation right now. And since I'm talking to all of you, it's hard for me to provide a detailed readout of that. I'll just say in general that -- look, I've made clear what they're not discussing, but I would not be surprised if they do have an opportunity to discuss the ongoing campaign. Obviously, Secretary Clinton has lots of people who have good intentions, who can offer solid political advice. The President is among them. And presumably someone who has won two national elections with more than 50 percent of the vote -- the first time that any President has done that since President Dwight D. Eisenhower -- I'm confident that Secretary Clinton is interested in whatever advice the President might have to share.\nBut President Obama has also been in the position of receiving a large quantity of political advice in the context of a competitive national election. So I'm confident that he will be respectful of the important decisions that she has to make. She alone is the person who can make the right decision for her and her campaign. And the President, I'm confident, will be entirely respectful of that.\nQ: Where are they having that meeting now, Josh? And can you also address some criticism today about the fact that they're flying together on Air Force One? Are the taxpayers paying for that? How is that funded or billed?\nMR. EARNEST: Shortly before I walked back here to visit with all of you, they were visiting with some staff in the senior staff cabin. As it relates to this trip, the White House of course follows all the rules and regulations that apply to the President's political travel. Those rules and regulations apply when the President makes what are now routine fundraising trips to places like Seattle and New York, most recently. Those rules also apply when the presumptive Democratic nominee for President is onboard Air Force One. So we'll follow all those rules and regulations.\nAs you know, the Democratic National Committee files monthly reports with the FEC. And in those reports, the Democratic National Committee discloses the disbursements that they make to the federal government consistent with those rules and regulations.\nQ: Josh, the White House doesn't disclose the reimbursement rate for specific flights, so it's impossible to determine what the specific reimbursement rate is for a trip like this one. Is that something that the White House would commit to disclosing in the future as the most transparent administration?\nMR. EARNEST: The White House follows all the rules and regulations that are on the books. And we can get you the very specific part of the code that applies in this situation. We follow all those rules, and the DNC does disclose on a monthly basis the payments that they make to the federal government consistent with those rules and regulations.\nQ: It's been a week -- really a month of Americans seeing large-scale terrorist attacks taking place across the globe, including here at home. Given the attack in Iraq, the attack in Bangladesh, what's sort of the response or your message to the American people after a week of seeing the same stuff play over the news to reassure them that this isn't going to come here at home?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, President Obama believes that his most important responsibility as President is the safety and security of the American people. And the President goes to great lengths to make clear that that's a priority. Obviously the United States is leading a coalition of 66 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. This international coalition was possible because the President demonstrated some leadership in the international community and worked hard to assemble this diverse coalition to focus our efforts against ISIL. And that includes military efforts involving 13,000 airstrikes that have resulted in more than 45 percent of the territory in Iraq that ISIL previously controlled being retaken. Syria opposition forces with the support of our coalition have retaken about 20 percent of the territory inside of Syria that ISIL previously controlled.\nSo we're making progress, and we are applying significant pressure to ISIL leaders in Iraq and in Syria. Unfortunately, what we have seen is an effort by ISIL to try to export their radical ideology and inspire people to carry out acts of violence in other locations. The United States is working very intensively with our allies and partners around the globe to combat those efforts. That includes trying to counter the radical messaging of ISIL on social media. It includes better coordination among intelligence agencies and customs officials to shut down the flow of foreign fighters and to more effectively monitor individuals who are crossing borders.\nBut this is a significant challenge. And the President and his national security team understand that this isn't just a significant challenge, it's also the President's top priority. And the President receives regular briefings on homeland security, and the President receives regular briefings from his national security team about our ongoing efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And I'm confident that for as long as he remains in office, the President and his team will be focused very carefully on this priority.\nQ: Josh, there was some indecision about whether the Secretary and the President were going to make this trip together, especially after the Bill Clinton-Loretta Lynch encounter last week. Can you talk about how the decision was made to travel together and what the symbolism of sort of continuity of purpose that's intended to send?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, obviously by traveling together it gives President Obama and Secretary Clinton the opportunity to spend some time together and to visit. I know President Obama is looking forward to doing so as he was boarding the plane. I would expect that people might conclude that the President has a lot of personal affection for Secretary Clinton. People might conclude that the President is deeply invested in the success of her campaign. It would be right to draw those conclusions.\nAgain, with regard to the ongoing work at the Department of Justice, we have made clear time and time again that neither President Obama nor the White House is involved in that investigation. Neither President Obama nor the Obama White House will be involved in the prosecutorial decisions that are made by career prosecutors who have received now the recommendation of the FBI. So what message Secretary Clinton's travel aboard Air Force One sends and what it doesn't send should be quite clear to the American public.\nQ: Josh, just to draw a line under the earlier discussion, the DNC will reimburse the White House or the taxpayers for the appropriate level of money for this flight? Is that how it works?\nMR. EARNEST: It's slightly more complicated than that. But in a general --\nQ: Can you spell it out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I was hoping to avoid to in this setting, but let me just give you the top lines and we'll walk through the details.\nWe can get you the specific rules that are written down that apply in this scenario. But my understanding about the way that this works is that the Democratic National Committee essentially establishes an escrow account that Secretary Clinton's campaign committee pays into. And then the DNC will make disbursements from that escrow account to pay for the costs associated with President Obama's political activities. Because, keep in mind there are payments that are made by the DNC to the federal government any time the President is traveling for political purposes. So the fact that Secretary Clinton is aboard Air Force One doesn't change the rules. Those rules apply both for routine fundraising trips, but also when Secretary Clinton is aboard Air Force One.\nSo that, in general, is how this process works. But it is extraordinarily complicated. And we can certainly get you some more information, particularly as it relates to the details of the law in this case.\nQ: When somebody says \"taxpayers are paying for this trip and I object to that,\" your response to that is?\nMR. EARNEST: That the Obama administration follows all the rules and regulations about paying for political travel that previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have followed.\nQ: And this is purely a political trip? There's no official business on this trip, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: That is correct. This is a political trip.\nQ: Josh, how many more of these events should we expect the President to be doing jointly with Secretary Clinton? Is this going to be -- is this sort of the kickoff of a long summer of these joint events and appearances together?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let Secretary Clinton and her team describe the strategy here. I think one observation that I can make is that one of the benefits of having the strong political support of someone as high-profile and as influential as President Obama is that he doesn't struggle to get attention for the affirmative case that he will make for Secretary Clinton. There may be other prominent supporters of Secretary Clinton that only get a lot of attention for their remarks if they are appearing onstage with Secretary Clinton. President Obama can do so on his own.\nAnd that is only part of the kind of benefit associated with his strong support for Secretary Clinton's campaign. So I wouldn't rule out future joint events, but one of the reasons that President Obama's support is so important is it will not require the President making joint appearances with Secretary Clinton for you all to notice.\nQ: Can we ask one more question about the VP search, which I think was touched on earlier? Are you saying that President Obama would share his views or help bounce ideas around if Secretary Clinton asked, in terms of a running mate? Or do you know whether that's already occurred?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't know whether or not that's occurred. I don't anticipate being able to provide a detailed readout of their conversation, so I don't know whether or not she will ask him about that. If Secretary Clinton wanted to talk to President Obama about choosing a running mate, I'm sure he would not hesitate to engage in that discussion.\nPresident Obama has often described choosing Vice President Biden to be his running mate as the smartest political decision he ever made. So I think it's fair to say that President Obama believes that he was extraordinarily well served by the successful execution of the process of choosing a running mate.\nI know that Secretary Clinton has spoken admiringly of how well Vice President Biden has served President Obama. So presumably, Secretary Clinton would agree with President Obama that he made a smart decision in choosing Vice President Biden to be his running mate. That might lead her to seek President Obama's advice in that process. But I don't know whether or not it's happening. And again, I think even if I knew that it were, I don't think it's something I would be in a position to confirm, just because they're having a private conversation about it.\nQ: More broadly on messaging, staying on message is important to the administration. I'm just wondering whether President Obama is a little frustrated that on this day -- which took months of waiting until she had the right delegate numbers and the timing was right -- whether on this day, when he wanted the message to be just a pure show of Democratic unity, having images of them stepping off the plane together with headlines that read \"FBI\" and \"careless\" is really not what he wanted, and whether he is concerned that even if the long-term effect of today is that there's no prosecution, that the short-term effect will be to step on the message of the two of them.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't think the President is particularly concerned about that, primarily because the question you're raising is entirely outside of his control. Neither the President nor anybody at the White House had any influence on the ongoing -- or the recently completed FBI investigation. There was no White House influence on the conduct of that investigation. There's no White House influence on the conclusion of that investigation. There's no White House influence on the decision that Director Comey made to publicize many of the results of that investigation. And there certainly is no White House influence on the recommendation that Director Comey made to the Department of Justice.\nSo I think this falls in the category of accepting the things that you can't control. But I think what is also true is that the decision of the most popular national politician in the country to endorse the Democratic nominee is something that people will notice. And the President will have a very forceful case to make. I'll let all of you judge for yourself how effective he is in making that case. But the President has a forceful case to make, and I am completely confident that the news of the President making that case alongside Secretary Clinton will cut through.\nQ: One more thing. Director Comey has come under fire from a number of Republicans, it seems, particularly including the Speaker of the House, questioning the decision not to recommend criminal charges to the DOJ. Would the President defend Director Comey from that criticism? Would you defend Director Comey from that criticism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just make a couple of observations. The first is that Director Comey is of sufficient stature and skill that he can defend himself. The second is that there were a number of Republican members of Congress who, prior to today's announcement, expressed confidence in the investigation because Director Comey was leading it. I think the third relevant point is not just that Director Comey served in a prominent role in a Republican administration, but rather that Director Comey is somebody with a well-established reputation of being able to put politics aside and focus on his official responsibilities.\nSo that's the reason the President chose him for the job. Presumably, that's also the reason that Director Comey was confirmed with such strong bipartisan support in the United States Senate.\nBut again, Director Comey is of sufficient skill and stature that he can defend himself. He certainly doesn't need my help.\nEND 2:20 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-07-05", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Palmer, R-AL, and one cosponsor)\nThe Administration is strongly committed to upholding the highest accountability standards for Federal agencies and the Federal workforce, including strict standards to ensure that employees act in the best interests of the American people, and we appreciate the Congress' attention to government reform and oversight efforts. However, certain sections of this legislation would weaken the rights of Federal employees, and be impractical and administratively burdensome to implement. They would also have harmful unintended consequences, while failing to address the issues they are designed to solve and while raising serious constitutional concerns. Because of this, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4361 as considered by the Rules Committee.\nThe Administration believes that the approach to accountability in certain provisions of the legislation is misguided. For example, H.R. 4361 would require expedited removal procedures for agency senior executives that would raise significant constitutional concerns under the Appointments Clause and the Due Process Clause. These procedures impose a time-constricted case review and appeal process that would permit administrative judges who are not appointed in a constitutionally appropriate manner to render removal decisions, would make those decisions final if the administrative judges fail to act within 21 days, and would deny any review of the decisions of the administrative judges by the Merit Systems Protection Board. These procedures are substantially the same as those in section 707 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, which the Department of Justice notified the Congress in May of this year could not be defended against constitutional challenge. These provisions would significantly alter and diminish important rights and protections that are available to the vast majority of other employees across the government and that are essential to safeguarding employees' rights. Moreover, these provisions would hamper the Federal government's efforts to attract and retain top talent committed to serving in the Senior Executive Service.\nThe requirements for mandatory senior executive reassignment would be problematic to implement as written, and duplicative of existing efforts. Under a December 2015 Executive Order, \"Strengthening the Senior Executive Service,\" agencies are already required to develop and implement a senior executive rotation plan. The Executive Order provides a more productive approach that considers the agencies' talent and succession management plans, as well as the executive's individual development plan.\nThe bill would require the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report on the use of union official time across the Executive Branch on matters not currently covered in existing OPM reporting. The additional requirements are subjective and virtually impossible to measure. These additional, burdensome requirements would have to be manually gathered for approximately 2,000 local bargaining units across the Executive Branch, making it challenging, if not impossible, to meet the statutory deadlines established by the bill.\nIn addition to objectionable personnel policy provisions, this bill would set policy that would undermine existing government-wide cybersecurity and records management policies. Amending individual agency records management practices is unnecessary and would set a problematic precedent, as the Federal Records Act already provides clear, transparent, and effective requirements for managing Federal records.\nFinally, the \"Midnight Rule\" provisions in this bill would infringe on the powers of the President to faithfully execute the laws in the final months of the term. They would arbitrarily prohibit the issuance of key rules and thus prevent the implementation of laws passed by the Congress through otherwise lawful, well-justified, and beneficial regulations, and would also subject the rulemaking process to additional, unnecessary judicial review provisions.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4361, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-07-05", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4361 - Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act of 2016"}

Well, fired up!\nAudience members. Ready to go!\nThe President. I'm fired up. Hillary got me fired up. She got me ready to do some work. So I hope everybody had a great Fourth of July.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you back.\nI—now, first of all, let me just say I like any excuse to come to North Carolina. I just like North Carolina. I love the people in North Carolina. I used to—when we used to campaign here, I used to say, even the people who aren't voting for me are nice. You know, that's not true everywhere. [Laughter] So you've got great people here. And then, you've got great food. North Carolina has got some food. In fact, I will find someplace to stop and get some food before I head back to DC. I know you all have recommendations. [Laughter] I know I can't go to your house to get the food. [Laughter] Although, I'm sure you're an excellent cook.\nAnd then, you've got great basketball. [Applause] You've got great basketball. We all know that. We all know that. But I'm not going to get in between all the Tar Heel and Wolfpack and—[applause]—you know. Yes, Blue Devils. I—see, Deacons. I'm not going to get into all that. You just have great basketball in North Carolina. So I love an excuse to come to North Carolina.\nBut I'm here for a simple reason. I'm glad to see our outstanding congressional delegation. You are lucky to have them. I'm glad you've got an outstanding candidate for the Senate and an outstanding candidate for Governor. And I'm going to be working for them too. But I'm here today because I believe in Hillary Clinton, and I want you to help elect her to be the next President of the United States of America. That's why I'm here. Now, this is not—[laughter].\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Now, as Hillary mentioned, this is not the first time we campaigned together. We went up to New Hampshire after our primary in 2008. We went to Unity, New Hampshire, just in case people missed the point. [Laughter] That was the name of the town, Unity, New Hampshire. And we had gone through what was one of the longest, toughest primaries in history. And primaries are always tough, because you're arguing with your friends instead of the folks you disagree with. Sometimes, you've got to find things to disagree about even though you don't really disagree. [Laughter] So we were crisscrossing towns from New Hampshire to Nevada. And as much as I had admired her when we served together in the Senate, I came away from that primary admiring her even more.\nBecause during that year and a half, I had had a chance to see up close just how smart she was and just how prepared she was, especially since I had to debate her a couple dozen times. [Laughter] And let's be clear, she beat me, like, in the first—now, you don't have to rub it in. You don't have to rub it in, now. [Laughter] She beat me at least the first half, and then I just barely could play her to a draw. [Laughter] I always had to be on my game because she knew every fact and she knew every detail.\nAnd then, during those 18 months, I saw the passion that she feels for anybody who's experienced injustice, anybody who's faced discrimination, anybody who does everything right and still can't seem to get a fair shot, whether it was workers who had lost their jobs or kids unable to afford college. And you could tell it was personal to her because she had seen struggles in her own life. She had known challenges in her own life. And she could identify and empathize with people who were doing the right thing and wanted to make sure that they got a fair shake.\nAnd then, during the primaries, again and again, I saw how, even when things didn't go her way, she'd just stand up straighter and come back stronger. She didn't give up. She didn't pout. She just kept on going. She was the Energizer Bunny. [Laughter] She just kept on.\nAnd the bottom line is, she had to do everything I had to do, but she was like Ginger Rogers: She had to do it backwards in heels. And at the end of our contest, I saw the grace and the energy with which she threw herself into my campaign, not because she wasn't disappointed about the outcome of the primary, but because she knew there was something that was at stake that was bigger than either of us, and that was the direction of our country and how are we going to make sure that all the people who were counting on us could see a better life.\nSo we may have gone toe to toe from coast to coast, but we stood shoulder to soldier—shoulder to shoulder for the ideals that we share. So maybe Hillary was surprised, but I wasn't surprised when I asked Hillary to represent our interests and our values around the world as America's Secretary of State. I knew she would do a great job. I knew she would perform. I knew the regard in which she was held in capitals all around the world. I knew that the minute she took that job, there was a stature and a seriousness that would immediately mend some of the challenges that we had had around the world during that time.\nNow, let me tell you, North Carolina, my faith in Hillary Clinton has always been rewarded. I have had a front row seat to her judgment and her toughness and her commitment to diplomacy. And I witnessed it in the Situation Room, where she argued in favor of the mission to get bin Laden. I saw how, as a former Senator from New York, she knew, she understood because she had seen it, she had witnessed it, what this would mean for the thousands who had lost loved ones when the Twin Towers fell.\nI've benefited from her savvy and her skill in foreign capitals, where her pursuit of diplomacy led to new partnerships, opened up new nations to democracy, helped to reduce the nuclear threat.\nWe've all witnessed the work she's done to advance the lives of women and girls around the globe. She has been working on this since she was a young woman working at the Children's Defense Fund. She's not late to the game at this. She's been going door to door to make sure kids got a fair share, making sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education. She's been fighting those fights, and she's got the scars to prove it.\nAudience member. Thank you, Hillary!\nThe President. And Hillary and I shared—we shared a big hug the first time we saw each other after we finally realized one of the great causes of her career, finally guaranteeing access to quality, affordable health insurance for every single American. Because that's something she got started, and we picked up that baton and were able to get it across the finish line.\nThe bottom line is, she was a great Secretary of State. And by the way, that's not just my opinion. That was the view of the American people and pundits throughout the time that she was serving as Secretary of State, before the whole political machinery got moving. You remember that? It wasn't that long ago. It's funny how that happens. [Laughter] Everybody thought she was doing a great job.\nAudience member. She did do a great job.\nThe President. That's because she did do a good job. But it's funny how the filter changes a little bit. Same person, done the same work, but that filter is a powerful thing.\nBut it wasn't just what happened in the limelight that made me grow more and more to admire and respect Hillary. It was how she acted when the cameras weren't on. It was knowing how she did her homework. It was knowing how many miles she put in traveling to make sure that America was effectively represented in corners of the globe that people don't even know about. There wasn't any political points to be had, but she knew that it was important.\nI saw how she treated everybody with respect, even the folks who aren't, quote, unquote, \"important.\" That's how you judge somebody. It's how do they treat somebody when the cameras are off and they can't do anything for you. Do you still treat them right? Do you still treat them with respect? Do you still listen to them? Are you still fighting for them?\nI saw how deeply she believes in the things she fights for. And I saw how you can count on her, and how she won't waver and she won't back down. And she will not quit, no matter how difficult the challenge and no matter how fierce the opposition.\nAnd if there's one thing I can tell you, Charlotte, is, those things matter. Those things matter. I'm here to tell you that the truth is, nobody fully understands the challenges of the job of President until you've actually sat at that desk. Everybody has got an opinion. But nobody actually knows the job until you're sitting behind the desk. Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you've sat behind the desk.\nI mean, Sasha tweets, but she doesn't—[laughter]—think that she's—thereby should be sitting behind the desk. [Laughter] So you can't fully understand what it means to make life-and-death decisions until you've done it. That's the truth.\nBut I can tell you this. Hillary Clinton has been tested. She has seen up close what's involved in making those decisions. She has participated in the meetings in which those decisions have been made. She's seen the consequence of things working well and things not working well. And there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton—ever. And that's the truth.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. That's the truth.\nSo the bottom line is, I know Hillary can do the job. And that's why I am so proud, North Carolina, to endorse Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States.\nNow, I recognize, to some degree, I'm preaching to the choir. [Laughter] I know I probably don't need to tell anybody here why we need Hillary's steadiness and her levelheadedness and her brilliance and her temperament right now. Audience member. Right now!\nThe President. Right now. Because we've been through some tumultuous times in this new century.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And we'll continue to face all kinds of challenges and change in the years ahead. And in—this November, in this election, you are going to have a very clear choice to make between two fundamentally different visions of where America should go. And this isn't even really a choice between left and right or Democrat or Republican, this is a choice between whether we are going to cling to some imaginary past or whether we're going to reach for the future. This is about whether we have an America that works for everybody or just a few people.\nAnd Hillary is not somebody who fears the future. She believes that it is ours to shape, the same way it's always has been. Hillary understands that we make our own destiny as long as we're together, as long as we think of ourselves not as just a collection of individuals or a collection of interest groups or a collection of States, but as the United States of America. She knows that.\nShe know that when it comes to our economy. Because she knows that our economy works best not when it only benefits a few at the top, but when everybody has got a fair shot at success. As Hillary mentioned—look, when I came into office, things were not in very good shape, you will recall. [Laughter] We were losing 800,000 jobs a month, pursuing, by the way, the same proposals that the Republicans are still peddling. And over the past 6 years, our businesses have created more than 14 million new jobs. We've cut the unemployment rate in half. Manufacturing jobs have grown for the first time since another President Clinton was in office. By the way—and by the way, because they're always talking about us being these spendthrift Democrats, I just want to point out, we cut our deficit by nearly 75 percent. They didn't. They did not.\nWages for families are finally starting to rise again. But we've got so much more work to do. Because in the 21st century, we're not going to help families, we're not going to create jobs just by pretending that we can turn back the clock and women are going to somehow not be in the workforce anymore and people of color suddenly are not going to be competing and wanting a better future for their kids. We're not going to suddenly ignore all the progress that's been made over the last 30 years. We're not going to build walls around America or put technology back in a box. We're not going to reverse hard-won rights for women or minorities or Americans with disabilities to fully participate in the workforce. We're not going to do that.\nIf we're going to give working families—all families—a chance to succeed, we've got to make sure they can afford childcare and they've got sick leave and paid leave. And we've got to make sure women get equal pay for equal work. And we should make it easier, not harder, for workers to organize for better wages and working conditions. And we shouldn't eliminate the minimum wage, we should raise it high enough so if you work full time, you don't live in poverty.\nEach of these policies—the policies Hillary mentioned—would help working families feel more secure in today's economy. She's actually got a plan. It's actually paid for. [Laughter] You can actually look at it. [Laughter] Now, the fact that we haven't gotten all these ideas done, it's not the fault of immigrants or unions or some liberal socialist scheme. It's very simple: Republicans in Congress and Republican Governors have been blocking these ideas for the last 8 years. It's that simple.\nSo look, I just want to be clear, not everybody votes on the economy, I understand. There are other issues. But if your concern is who's going to look out for working families, if you're voting your pocketbook, if you're asking who's actually going to stand up for the guy on the construction site or the guy in the factory or the woman who's cleaning a hotel room or somebody who's really working hard—the working family—if that's your concern, this isn't even a choice. Because the other side has nothing to offer you. [Applause] The other side has got nothing to offer you.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. I'm going a little off script here, but I just want to repeat this. If your concern is working people, then this is not a choice. I don't care whether you're White, Black, Hispanic, Native American, polka dot, male, female. I don't care. If what you care is who's going to be fighting for ordinary folks who are fighting for a better life for themselves and their children, then I don't know how you vote for the guy who's against the minimum wage, against unions, against making sure that everybody gets a fair shot, against legislation for equal pay, against sick leave and family leave, against all the things that working families care about.\nSo if you're voting for the other team, it's not because of the economy. It's not because of the economy. You've got to be clear about that. Even the Republicans on the other side don't really know what the guy is talking about. [Laughter] They really don't. They really don't. If you ask them, they're all, like, \"I don't know.\" [Laughter] Then, they, kind of, duck the other way. Am I joking? No.\nSo you can choose a path that divides us with harsh rhetoric and pits working people against each other, all the while pushing policies that will just help folks at the top do even better. But that's not helping working families. Or we can transform our politics so they're responsive to working families, so that all people of all races and all backgrounds get a higher wage and all folks get quality health care and a decent retirement and all children in this country get a better education that lets them dream bigger than their circumstances. That's what Hillary Clinton believes. And that's why I'm supporting her for President of the United States. And that's why you should too.\nNow, to me, that, in and of itself, would be enough to make the choice. But we've got some other choices. You can go the path that denies climate change is real, or you can choose a path where American jobs and businesses lead the world to combat it. Over the last 7 years, we have doubled renewable energy in this country. We've—remember when we were all concerned about our dependence on foreign oil? Well, let me tell you, we've cut the amount of oil we buy from other countries in half. Remember when the other team was promising they were going to get gas prices down in, like, 10 years and—[applause]? We did it. Did it.\nSo we've been able to shape an energy policy that's good for families, good for your pocketbook. And with Secretary Clinton's help, America ultimately led nearly 200 other nations to an agreement to save this planet for future generations. Now, maybe you don't care about this; maybe you think 99 percent of scientists are wrong. [Laughter] Or you can——\nAudience members. Thank you, President Obama!\nThe President. You're welcome. But the point is, we're not done with this. So where we go from here is up to you. You can vote with the climate deniers who want to tear up the agreements we've crafted and doom our kids to a more dangerous world, or you can vote to keep putting people back to work building a cleaner energy future for all of us. That's part of what's at stake in this election. That's one of the reasons I'm supporting Hillary Clinton for President.\nHillary mentioned how we operate on the world stage. Now, let me just say, I know the other guy talks about making America great again. I—America is really great. And just the other day, somebody was writing about, wow, when you look at the surveys in the world, it turns out that when Obama came into office, the world didn't think we were that great, but now they think we're the greatest. They think we're the strongest. They think we're the best positioned. We were in a hole before I came into office. But right now the world—the rest of the world thinks we're pretty darn great.\nAnd by the way, you can look that up. That's a fact. That's not, like, just something I just made up and tweeted. [Laughter] So there are actually, like, surveys done. They poll people so you actually know what people think. You don't just assert it. And it turns out, that's what they think. You can look it up. [Laughter]\nPart of the reason is because we had an outstanding Secretary of State. Part of the reason is, is that Hillary understood and continues to understand that just a bunch of tough talk doesn't replace the hard work of diplomacy. A bunch of phony bluster doesn't keep us safe. And she understands we can't retreat from a world that needs American leadership. That's why she offers a smarter approach that uses every element of American power to protect our people and to protect our allies.\nShe is and will be a stateswoman who makes us proud around the world. She'll deploy diplomacy whenever possible, but she also knows what it takes to be a Commander in Chief, and I know she will never hesitate to use force when it is necessary to protect us. And she'll know how to mobilize the world around the causes that we believe in, that we know are right, and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That's strength. That's leadership. And that's why Hillary Clinton has to be the next President of the United States of America.\nAudience members. I'm with her! I'm with her! I'm with her!\nThe President. I am with her!\nAudience members. I'm with her! I'm with her! I'm with her!\nThe President. I am with her. You know, part of the reason why we are here is because we all share the belief that this country only lives up to its potential when every single one of us get a chance to succeed. Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, rich, poor——\nAudience member. Turkish——\nThe President. ——Turkish American—[laughter]—gay, straight, male, female—all of us matter. All of us share the same creed. All of us pledge allegiance to the same flag. That doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. We all have different ideas and beliefs, and that's part of what makes America great.\nBut I agree with Hillary that our democracy works best when there are basic bonds of trust between us; when we recognize that every voice matters and the people who disagree with us most strongly love our country just as much as we do. You never heard Hillary Clinton demonize other people. You haven't heard her not be willing to engage in folks even when they disagree with her. You ask about folks in the Senate who were on the other side, they liked working with her. Even though some of them had done everything they could to tear her down when she was First Lady, she still worked with them.\nAnd that brand of leadership is how we're going to get things done. That's how we can protect more of our kids from gun violence. After Newtown, the other side blocked any new gun safety reforms. After Orlando, they blocked any new gun safety reforms. They're not listening to 90 percent of the American people—Democrats and Republicans—who support background checks. And making sure somebody who's on a no-fly list can't actually go out and purchase an automatic rifle. Hillary knows how to build coalitions. And she knows we can take smart steps that protect both our rights and our kids so they can go to the movies or to church or to a nightclub or to school. And if you believe that, too, then there's no choice here: You've got to vote for Hillary Clinton.\nHer brand of leadership can fix a broken immigration system so that it lives up to our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. You know, unless you're a Native American, somebody brought you here. [Laughter] Somebody came here. You came from someplace else, now. So I just want to be clear about that. And not everybody had their papers straight when they came. I'm just saying.\nAnd there are millions of striving young people whose lives hang in the balance. And they want to give something back to this country that they love. They want to serve in our military. They want to go to college. They want to be doctors. They want to cure diseases. And for years, the Republicans who run this Congress, they talk a good game about immigration reform, and then they don't do anything. And now they've picked a nominee whose only plan is to build a higher wall. That's not a plan——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. No, no, no. Hold on a second. I was waiting for this opportunity: Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. ——vote! [Applause] Don't boo, vote! Booing doesn't help! You need to vote!\nBut if you care about a smart immigration policy that controls our borders and makes sure that it's lawful, but also gives everybody opportunity, then this is your candidate. You've got to vote in this election.\nAnd you know what, if you don't think your vote matters, if you don't think the stakes are high enough, remember that just last month, the Supreme Court could not reach a decision involving immigration because Republicans in the Senate had refused to just do their job and just have the courtesy to meet with a nominee that even they admit is one of the most qualified ever to be nominated to a seat on the Supreme Court. Won't even give him a hearing. Won't even give him an up-or-down vote. They'd rather have their nominee for President choose his own justice to fill that seat.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote! The President. Got to vote!\nHe wants to nominate a justice who views the world he does. That's not a good thing. [Laughter]\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. That's not what you want on the highest court in the land.\nThe Supreme Court is no joke. The people who sit on that Bench make monumental decisions that affect all of your rights, our responsibilities and duties to each other as citizens, affect every aspect of our daily lives. This is not a reality show. This is not entertainment, this is real. This is not a reality show, this is reality. And being President of the United States means you've have to deal with——\nAudience members. Reality.\nWhen a crisis hits, you can't just walk off the set. [Laughter] You can't fire the scriptwriter. [Laughter] You can't be reckless. You don't have the luxury of just saying whatever pops into your head. You've actually got to know what you're talking about. You've got to actually do your homework. You can't just kick out reporters. [Laughter] You can't go to another country, and if they ask you a question you don't like, just kick them out—[laughter]—because you're in another country. You've got to apply steady judgment, even when things don't go your way. You've got to make the tough calls, even when they're not popular and even when they won't pay off right away or increase your poll numbers. You've got to be able to handle criticism without taking it personally. You've just got to brush it off and get the job done.\nThat's some of what I've learned while serving as your President. That's some of what Hillary has learned as a Senator and as Secretary of State. And that's why I'm voting for Hillary Clinton to be the next President of the United States.\nI know I've gone on too long. That's what happens—you haven't campaigned in a while, you start just enjoying it too much. So let me just simplify this. And let me be blunt. I want to be blunt. Can I be blunt? [Laughter] I'm going to be blunt. You know, Hillary has got her share of critics. That's what happens when you're somebody who's actually in the arena. That's what happens when you've fought for what you believe in. That's what happens when you dedicate yourselves to public service over the course of a lifetime. And what sets Hillary Clinton apart from so many others is, she never stopped caring, she never stopped trying.\nWe're a young country, so we like new things. And I've benefited from that culture, let's face it. When I came on the scene in '08, everybody said, \"Well, he's new.\" [Laughter] They don't say that now, because I'm not. But sometimes, we take somebody who's been in the trenches and fought the good fight and been steady for granted. Sometimes, we act as if never having done something and not knowing what you're doing is a virtue. [Laughter] We don't do that, by the way, for airline pilots. [Laughter] We don't do that for surgeons. But somehow we think, President of the United States, yes, let's just give—I don't know—who's that guy? Come on. [Laughter]\nAnd so, as a consequence, that means that sometimes Hillary doesn't get the credit that she deserves.\nAudience members. That's right!\nThe President. But the fact is, Hillary is steady. And Hillary is true. And she's been in politics for the same reason I am: because we can improve other people's lives by doing this work. And we don't care about the slings and arrows that are thrown at us, because we know that's how real change and real progress happens and that we, if we're willing to work hard, can finish—can bring about changes that make life better for some kid out there, some senior out there, somebody who's unemployed out there.\nAnd it may take more than a year. And sometimes, it takes more than a term. And sometimes, it takes more than one Presidency or even one generation. And yes, that's old fashioned. I think she'll fess up to that. [Laughter] But we want people to believe that their Government can work and that the President cares and that every child in this country should have the same chance that this country gave us.\nBecause we weren't born with a silver spoon. And we know that behind all the division and sometimes angry rhetoric of this election year and all the petty bickering and the point scoring and the punditry, the ordinary American—Americans are good. And they are generous. And they are hard-working. And they've got an awful lot of common sense. And we share a certain set of common values and hopes and dreams.\nThat's why I ran in 2008. And I believe in those values and those ideals more than ever. And I believe in you, the American people, more than ever. And I am more optimistic about our future than ever. And that's why my faith—my faith—is stronger about the simple American ideal as old as our founding that people who love their country can change it for the better. I have seen it happen.\nI have run my last campaign. And I couldn't be prouder of the things we've done together. But I'm ready to pass the baton. And I know that Hillary Clinton is going to take it. And I know she can run that race: the race to create good jobs and better schools and safer streets and a safer world. And that's why I'm fired up! And that's why I'm ready to go! And that's why I'm with her!\nAnd that's why I need you to work just as hard to make sure that Hillary Rodham Clinton is the next President of the United States of America.\nGod bless you, North Carolina.

God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-07-05", "title": "Remarks at a Fundraiser for Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton in Charlotte, North Carolina"}

For me, one of those people was Ab Mikva. When I was graduating law school, Ab encouraged me to pursue public service. He saw something in me that I didn't yet see in myself, but I know why he did it: Ab represented the best of public service himself, and he believed in empowering the next generation of young people to shape our country. Ab's life was a testament to that truth. Six decades ago, when he first tried to volunteer in Democratic politics, the Chicago political machine told him that they \"don't want nobody nobody sent.\" Ab didn't take no for an answer, because he knew that in America, in our democracy, everybody can be somebody, everybody matters.\nThat conviction led Ab, a son of immigrants and a World War II veteran, to serve Illinois as a State legislator and serve our Nation in every branch of Government: as a Congressman, Federal judge, and White House Counsel. In every position he held, Ab's integrity and wisdom consistently put him on the right side of history, from fighting against prejudice and discrimination and for free speech and civil liberties. He reformed Illinois's criminal code, defended consumers' rights, and although his decision striking down the ban on gay Americans serving in our military was overturned, history proved him right.\nLike so many admirers, I've lost a mentor and a friend. But as we mourn his passing, I'm comforted by the thought that countless Americans will continue fighting for progressive causes Ab believed in because he pushed them toward public service, both during his time in Government and through Mikva Challenge, which he established with his wonderful wife Zoe. We're all better off because we were sent Ab Mikva, and because Ab in turn sent us forward to do big things. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to Zoe, their three daughters, seven grandchildren, and the generations of young patriots Ab inspired.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118018", "text": "Via Conference Call\n10:49 A.M. EDT\nMR. PRICE: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining this morning's call. Following the President's statement this morning, we wanted to give you a bit more detail on the plans he announced for our troop posture in Afghanistan.\nFirst a bit about ground rules. This call will be on background. You can attribute what you hear to senior administration officials. It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. So please, we ask that you not use this material until the call is over.\nSo with that, I will turn it over to my colleagues to get us started.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Great. Thanks, everybody. I'll just make a few opening comments and turn it over to my colleagues here. I won't reprise the President's whole statement here, but let me just give some context for the decision that he announced today.\nFirst of all, as he has said, over the last seven years we've made significant progress in addressing the core mission that brought us into Afghanistan in the first place, which was to degrade and ultimately defeat al Qaeda. Over the last several years, we've struck significant blows against al Qaeda, which could not have been done without our presence in Afghanistan and our ability to support an Afghanistan government that was increasingly providing for its own security, and also to have the counterterrorism platforms necessary to continue to go after terrorist networks.\nAt the same time, as the Afghan government and security forces have gotten stronger, we've been able to significantly draw down our forces, which peaked at around 100,000 troops to now under 10,000 U.S. troops in the country. We also have always been focused on ensuring that we are giving the Afghan government and security forces the best possible opportunity to continue to work to stabilize their country and to combat a Taliban insurgency, while also continuing to ensure that we have the necessary platforms both to support the Afghans but also to ensure that there's not a reemergence of al Qaeda or potential emergence of a terrorist organization like ISIL that could pose a greater threat in the region.\nAnd so the President has been meeting regularly with his national security team to review the situation in Afghanistan. When General Nicholson took over, he undertook an assessment of the situation on the ground and then worked with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to provide the President with a recommendation as to what the appropriate troop level would be for the conclusion of 2016. And again, today the President made his announcement of the troop levels that we will maintain through the end of the year, again, based on that recommendation from the Secretary and the Chairman.\nI'd note importantly that we are making this announcement the day before the NATO Summit. NATO continues to be deeply invested in Afghanistan and its future. We have a number of allies who are themselves committing troops beyond 2016. We have significant contributions in terms of funding the Afghan security forces from out NATO partners. And of course, many of the allies who will be in Warsaw also provide additional assistance to the Afghan government.\nSo we wanted to take this step to demonstrate the continued U.S. leadership of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. We believe that this announcement will be very welcomed by our NATO allies and by the Afghan government in that it provides a clarity about our intentions and our enduring support for Afghanistan. And, again, it will allow us I think to have a more constructive discussion on Afghanistan at the NATO Summit as the alliance plans for how it can continue to support the ANSF and work together through the end of 2016 and beyond.\nThe last thing I'd just say is we also believe that this is the responsible way to ensure that we have the best possible plan in place to carry out the mission of training and advising and assisting the Afghans, and engaging in our counterterrorism efforts through the end of this year. And then the next President will have the opportunity to make their own determination about what additional steps to take regarding our troop presence.\nSo with that, I'll stop and I'll turn it over to my DOD colleague to give some more detail on the announcement.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll just give a breakdown kind of how we were thinking of the 8,400 to support, as the President said, the two primary missions that we currently have in Afghanistan which is train, advise and assist the Afghan National Security Forces, in addition to executing our counterterrorism operation.\nBut the 8,400 also reflects a lot of lessons learned in the last two fighting seasons. In particular on TAA -- the train, advise, and assist mission -- we definitely have recognized the effects of having advisory capacity with the Afghans at the core level. And this is an important part of what the 8,400 will enable us to continue to do through the end of year. That means we'll be able to provide advisory capacity to the Afghan National Security Forces at the two- and three-star level out in the field, and doing it on a sustained expeditionary basis. So it's a qualitative piece that we wanted to ensure that we could continue through the end of the year.\nI also would say that it enables us on the NATO front, with our Resolute Support partners, to continue to provide critical enabling capacities in support of the broader Resolute Support Mission.\nSo three big buckets: Robust CT. The second is train, advise, and assist all the way to the core level on an expeditionary and sustained basis, which the Afghans -- we've been using to create effect already, as well as the enabling capacity with NATO.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'd like to just add a couple words about reconciliation. We continue to recognize that this long war will only end through a political negotiation between the Afghan government and the Taliban to work out terms of peace and reconciliation. And the President's decision today to maintain a sizeable U.S. military presence continuing in the train, advise and assist role will enable the Afghan government to preserve security while it pursues a peace settlement.\nPresident Ghani remains absolutely committed to pursuing a peace and reconciliation process. And the United States supports the Afghans going into this without any preconditions for a reconciliation process. Our position is we would support any political settlement that includes the Taliban renouncing violence, breaking ties with international terrorism, and accepting Afghanistan's constitution, including protections for women and minorities.\nSo, in our view, the Taliban have a real choice. They can accept the government of Afghanistan's invitation to engage in a peace process and ultimately become part of the political system of a sovereign, unified Afghanistan, which would be supported by the international community. Or they can continue (inaudible) fellow Afghans, which is what is destabilizing the country.\nQ: Hello, thank you. I have two questions. One, can you tell us if you budgeted for the funds for these troops to remain in Afghanistan, and just give us some idea where that money comes from? And secondly, if you could give us an update on where the negotiation and reconciliation process stands right now.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. With respect to your first question, anytime we develop options like this, we obviously look very carefully and think through what the cost associated will be. So part of the development of the option allowed us to view that work. And now what we will do is we will engage and discuss with Congress about how to ensure that we're providing the necessary support for the mission.\nAnd in the past, we've always been able to work collaboratively with Congress to provide the necessary support for our efforts in Afghanistan. And going forward today and beyond, we'll be in consultations with Congress about that piece of the announcement.\nI'll turn it over to my colleague on the other question.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So you'll recall that -- just a bit history -- that last summer, the Taliban came to the table with the Afghan government for the first and had peace talks in Murree, Pakistan. That process later came apart. But in an effort to test the proposition that the Taliban were prepared to come to the table, we worked with three other international partners -- the government of Afghanistan, the government of China, and the government of Pakistan -- to set up a quadrilateral coordinating group.\nWe met a number of times early in the year, and issued a call for the Taliban to come to the table to negotiate in an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process. The call was made twice, actually. Regrettably, the Taliban declined to join the process. But from our perspective, those offers still remain open. We support the quadrilateral process. And we continue to hope that the Taliban will come to the table. In the meantime, we'll continue to explore all opportunities for pursuing reconciliation.\nQ: Two things. One, could you talk a little bit more about how you arrived at the 8,400 number? What exactly will -- where will you draw those troops down from? A little bit about that decision process. And also this is obviously a really difficult decision for the President, who has made this a priority -- wanted to end the ground wars. This is not the drawdown as quick as he wanted to do, obviously. Can you talk a little bit about when he reached this decision, how we reached it, what pushed him to this point?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: On the first question, the recommendation on 8,400 really reflects the commanders' recent assessment, which my colleague spoke to earlier and the President obviously discussed. We took a look at the dynamic security environment in Afghanistan, we took a look at the Afghan national security forces' capabilities and where they were, and we also looked at in the short term their performance over the last two fighting seasons. And so capturing all of those lessons learned, we came to the decision and recommendation to maintain at 8,400.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, the only thing I'd add to that is that the President's guidance was to just have a recommendation about what the best presence and necessary resources would be at the end of 2016. And so the effort was to design that recommendation based on what those needs would be, what we've learned about we support the ANSF, what missioned we needed to protect and maintain. And so, again, that did allow for a slight reduction in the number of troops.\nBut this was not about calibrating how many troops we can reduce -- it was about designing what the best possible presence was to carry out these particular missions at the end of the year, and this is the resource request that came from the Department of Defense because of that process.\nOn your second question, I'd say a couple of things, Christi. First of all, again, just to reiterate in some more detail what I said earlier, I think as it relates to this effort in Afghanistan over the course of the last seven and a half years, one of the things that the President has always been very focused on in his public comments from the very beginning of his time in office is to, on the one hand, remind people of what the core mission has been in Afghanistan, which is a mission to deny al Qaeda a safe haven from which they can launch attacks against the United States and their allies. And we believe that because of our presence in Afghanistan that we've been able to put an unprecedented amount of pressure on al Qaeda in South Asia and have significantly degraded their leadership ranks and their operational capacity.\nAnd so, in that sense, we do believe that there's an enormous amount that has been accomplished. Again, another element has always been trying to give the Afghans the best possible opportunity to stabilize their country and to deal with a protracted Taliban insurgency.\nAnd on that second point, I think the one thing that has changed significantly is the nature of our commitment and the scale of our commitment. At the peak of the surge, we had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan -- that cost an enormous amount in terms of the sacrifice that our men and women in uniform were making, in terms of the resources to the American taxpayer. And we were in the lead in that fight. But because of the transition that we've done in building up the Afghan national security forces, we've been able to significantly draw down that commitment of U.S. troops to under 10,000 and, ultimately, to roughly 8,400.\nAnd one of the things that has guided the President in wanting to maintain this commitment is that as the Afghans have moved into the lead, they've really been in the fight. And it's a tough fight, and we've seen them take on significant casualties, and we've seen them confront the Taliban. And we've seen them continue to desire and request our support and the support of our NATO allies. And so, given that circumstance, we have been committed to determining, what is the responsible assistance we can provide to them.\nAnd obviously, this maintains a certain troop presence. But I think it's importance to note that it's significantly reduced from where we were. It is a presence of troops that are not in the lead for security, but rather are in a supporting role in the counterterrorism mission. And it's, frankly, very consistent with what President Obama is doing in other theaters -- like you see in Iraq and Syria, where you have U.S. forces in much smaller numbers -- not responsible for the security of a country, or not responsible for patrolling the streets in cities and villages and mountains of a country, but rather U.S. forces there in a role where we have a counterterrorism capacity to deal with potential threats to our homeland or our allies, and the support capacity, where we're bolstering partners on the ground who are doing the fighting and who are ultimately going to be responsible for security.\nSo I think the shift has been in what is the model. Is the model one where the U.S. is responsible for securing Afghanistan and Iraq, or is the U.S. in a supporting role, with a much smaller number, a much greater -- a much reduced risk in terms of the casualties we're taking and the resources we're expending.\nSo I think his decision is based on all these questions -- not just Afghanistan but Iraq and Syria. I think it's very evident what his approach is, again, which is to make sure we're doing everything necessary to disrupt and ultimately defeat terrorist networks, while significantly reducing the role of the U.S. military in terms of its ground presence and also reducing the resources associated with that presence.\nQ: Can you shed some light on what General Nicholson asked for in terms of authorities and troop numbers? And secondly, if you could address the CT mission and tell us to what extent the U.S. military will be at war with the Taliban in the months ahead. For some time now, their primary authority was self-defense, but that's changed slightly in the last few weeks. Going forward, to what extent are we going to be on the offensive against the Taliban?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I'll start and my colleague may want to add. First of all, I think the decisions that have taken place in the last several weeks reflect where this mission -- well, look, obviously, there are always contingencies over the next few months, but the President's view was let's make these decisions now about troop numbers and about authorities. So I think you should expect -- and it's our expectation -- that the decision that was announced on authorities and the decision that was announced today on troops is our expectation for where the mission will be in Afghanistan through the end of the President's term in office.\nSo, again, I'd note the caveat that he always will listen to recommendations from commanders on the ground, but we went through this process in advance of the NATO Summit so that we could establish what the appropriate authorities were for U.S. forces and what the appropriate troop number was for the end of 2016 so that we could have that kind of certainty and planning through the end of the year, and then allow for the next president and their incoming team to make any further determinations going forward. So, again, I'd expect these authorities and this troop number to be the decisions that guide this mission through the end of the year.\nI'll just say one thing on -- oh, and in terms of the troop request, the recommendation that came to the President was from the Secretary and the Chairman, and informed by General Nicholson's own review, and their recommendation was the troop level that we announced today. So this matched that recommendation.\nThe only thing I'd say on the authorities -- and my colleague may want to add something -- is, look, our CT operations are focused on -- are not focused on the Taliban. The authority shift we made simply represents ensuring that we have the best possible capacity to come to the assistance of the Afghan security forces, based on what we've seen about how they are operating, based on what we've seen about how we can best provide support to their efforts.\nAnd so they are the ones who are on the offensive against the Taliban. The Afghan national security forces are the ones who go on the offensive against the Taliban. We, with these authorities, are giving ourselves the capacity to come to their support in certain circumstance.\nI don't know if you want to add anything.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure, why don't I go back to the new authorities that were granted to the department. So in May, the President gave the department additional authorities to be exercised within the two missions. And these authorities now permit limited U.S. combat-enabler support to Afghan in DSF to achieve what we call \"strategic effect.\" So essential, the commander will have the flexibility to provide, in a limited way, combat-enabling support to the conventional operation.\nSo, for example, with the Afghans operating in the south, the commander can now use this authority to support them in a limited way to achieve a broader effect, to make sure they can maintain momentum against the Taliban. But it's going to be used in a very limited way and in support of a broader objective.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on the authorities issue. It has been used in a limited way already, as we learned last week. Can you describe to the extent it's been used? We know that there have been some airstrikes. I'm also wondering to what extent combat advisors have been used on the ground in light of these new authorities. Thank you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. I don't want to get into specifics of instances when we've used them -- all I can say is that it's early going and that they have been used, and this commander is executing them in a limited way.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The only thing I'd add here is that this is just to give some flexibility to commanders on the ground where if there's a particular circumstance where the Afghans need a very specific capability in support of an ongoing operation that they're undertaking or a circumstance in which they are under attack, there is some additional space for us to provide that support. You mentioned the potential for the use of airstrikes, for example.\nBut this does not apply in terms of opening up the aperture for the U.S. essentially being in combat with Afghan forces against the Taliban across the country. This is about taking our training, advise and assist mission, looking at how the Afghans are operating, and seeing where we can essentially provide them some limited additional support in very specific circumstances, again, where they're on the offensive trying to achieve a certain objective, or where they find themselves in a circumstance where there's a unique capability that we can provide to allow them to continue their operations.\nQ: Thanks, guys. Thanks for doing the call. The President talked about other countries in the region providing a safe haven for terrorism, and you also talked about the importance of denying a safe haven for terrorists. Was the President sort of implicitly talking about Pakistan? And if so, is there something that we can expect in the next six months that the President will do to put pressure on Pakistan to not provide safe haven for terrorism?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, look, I think this has been a longstanding issue of discussion between the United States and Pakistan and between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have seen Pakistan, over the years, go on the offensive against different terrorist organizations and take a significant amount of casualties in those offensives. At the same time, we've also seen a persistent presence of extremist networks inside of Pakistan as well.\nAnd so this is something that we have consistently raised with them. We've expressed concerns, obviously, about groups like the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, as well as, of course, al Qaeda. Again, Pakistan has cooperated with us. They have taken steps to go after some of these groups. But we do believe that they need to provide continued pressure and that ultimately it's in their security interests to, number one, work with us to root out terrorist networks, but, number two, to have a broader political resolution to the conflicts that have torn at this region. And that's why, again, we believe an Afghan-led reconciliation process should be supported by Pakistan.\nBut I don't know if you guys have anything to add.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If I could add to that, I think if you check this, General Raheel Sharif, Pakistan's army chief, just today gave a speech in Pakistan saying something that we've heard before from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that Pakistan's territory will not be allowed to be used for terrorist attacks against its neighbors. But what Raheel added today, which was very significant, is he issued instructions to the security elements -- law enforcement, intelligence, military elements -- to enforce that dictum, to ensure that the territory is not used for terrorism.\nNow, we'll see how this plays out on the ground. But I think what Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had indicated to President Obama when he came to the White House here last October was a recognition that Pakistan will only be secure if there is peace and stability in Afghanistan. And Pakistan has worked with the Afghan government, Ashraf Ghani, to support a peace process that would align all forces, all the insurgents in Afghanistan in a political process to bring peace and stability to that country. So we hope that Pakistan will continue to live up to its words, and we were very pleased with what we heard from General Raheel Sharif.\nQ: Is it possible to characterize how the 8,400 break down between the two missions, the TAA mission and the CT mission? And does that reflect some change in balance between the current mix in terms of the 9,800?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll see if my colleague has anything more to add, but I think -- and ultimately I think General Nicholson can speak to the specifics of the breakdown best -- but ultimately, I think that the balance reflects something very similar to where we are today. So, in other words, there's not a shift in terms of the nature of the forces from where we are with our current levels. It's just the matter that we can reduce that by a small amount while ensuring that we're continuing both of those missions with appropriate resourcing and effectiveness.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't really have much more to add to that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So the balance is basically very similar to what the current balance is.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: What I could add -- just this weekend at the summit in Warsaw, the NATO Summit in Warsaw, the leaders of the Alliance will come together and affirm the continued commitment, both financial commitment to the Afghan security forces, but also contributions of military troops to the resolute support mission, which will continue. And that mission, which the U.S. is a major contributor, will primarily be responsible for the train, advise and assist mission, whereas the United States primarily is responsible for the counterterrorism mission.\nMR. PRICE: And with that, I think we're ready to conclude. Just a reminder, this call was on background, and the embargo is now lifted. Thank you very much.\nEND 11:19 A.M.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117835", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:34 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody.\nQ: Quiet a day. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: You know, just a day at the office.\nI do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions. I assume there are a variety of topics we'll cover today. But, Josh, I'll let you choose where we start.\nQ: Great. Thanks, Josh. Why don't we start with Afghanistan? I wanted to see if you could tell us how the President feels that this troop announcement reflects on his legacy. As President, he came in wanting to disentangle the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq, now leaving conflicts in both of those places, as well as ones in Syria and in Libya. Does the President wish that he would have been able to finish his presidency without so many Americans still overseas in Afghanistan?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, it's important for people to understand the context in which this decision is taking place. First of all, it takes place in the context of a dramatic change in the nature and scale of the U.S. presence if Afghanistan. When President Obama took office, there were about 38,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The President spent much of his first year in office weighing how to fulfill the promise that he made in the context of the campaign, which is to ensure that our national security resources were focused on the real and significant enduring threat that existed in the form of core al Qaeda in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\nAnd in the context of making that decision, the President made the choice -- based on recommendations from the Department of Defense and other members of his national security team -- to increase our troop presence above 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. That peak was reached around 2011 and 2012. And that surge of resources, that surge of troops on the ground had a material impact on the security situation in Afghanistan such that we have succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. We have succeeded in building up the capacity of Afghan security forces to provide for the security of their own country. We have also formed a strong and enduring relationship with the Afghan central government such that the Afghan government now is an effective partner of the United States and the rest of the international community that is focused on the situation in Afghanistan.\nThe President's announcement today indicated that the troop level headed into next year will be 8,400. That represents a substantial commitment on the part of the United States to the future of Afghanistan. It also represents a significant reduction in the number of men and women that the United States has in harm's way in Afghanistan. And it is also a validation of the approach that is focused on training, advising, and occasionally assisting Afghan security forces so that they can fight for their country.\nThis doesn't just reduce the exposure of our men and women in uniform; it also enhances the longer-term outlook for the security situation in Afghanistan. We've already tried the approach -- the previous administration tried the approach where the United States would try to impose a military solution on a country like Afghanistan. That's not a long-term solution.\nSo the President's approach is one that ensures a positive long-term outlook for Afghanistan. But there's also no denying that the next president will also have to make some substantial weighty decisions with regard to our ongoing relationship with Afghanistan, with regard to our ongoing strategy for countering extremists that continue to try to threaten U.S. interests that are based in Afghanistan. And there will be substantial questions to be answered and decisions to be made about our ongoing relationship with the Afghan government. But there's no denying the progress that we've made and the change that -- the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan that we have seen as a result of the decisions made by President Obama over the last eight years.\nQ: I wanted to drill down on what administration officials told us on a call was the administration's intention to engage with Congress on finding a way to pay for these additional troops. Can you be more specific? Are you planning to submit a supplemental budget request? Do you have any sense of what actually the cost is for these additional troops? And are you willing to ask Congress to increase military spending to pay for these troops without also increasing domestic spending, as you've called for in the past?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, let me say a couple things about our expectations. The first is, given the positive reaction that we've seen from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to this announcement, I would expect that we would see constructive engagement on the part of Congress to fulfill their responsibility to pay for this policy decision. That's their responsibility. We would expect them to fulfill it -- particularly when you consider that this is a policy that they say they support.\nSo this shouldn't be a situation where there needs to be a lot of arm-twisting or partisan wrangling. This is the Commander-in-Chief making a national security decision that is supported by senior leaders in both parties.\nSo what's also true is that Republicans spent a lot of time over the last six years or so talking about how the United States of America would benefit from Republican majorities serving in the House of Representatives in the United States Senate. Those majorities come with certain responsibilities. One of those responsibilities, among the most important of those responsibilities, is making sure that our national security efforts are properly funded.\nNow, what's also true, Josh, is that our Department of Defense has indicated that this strategy for Afghanistan is a priority for them. And our men and women in uniform and our commanders in Afghanistan have said that this enhanced troop presence is a genuine priority for the Department of Defense. We would expect -- well, and what is true right now, and many of your news organizations are covering this, is that Congress right now is interested in funding a variety of projects that the Department of Defense does not at all describe as priorities.\nQ: But we're talking about troops here, and not these other bomber projects.\nMR. EARNEST: That's true. But you're raising a question, though, about how the Congress will apportion the limited resources of U.S. taxpayers to focus on our national security priorities. And there are a number of things that do have the attention of Congress right now that our military commanders say are not priorities, but they do say that our Afghanistan presence is a priority. And so we do expect that members of Congress will listen to our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan and at the Department of Defense, at the Pentagon, about what our priorities are and fund them accordingly.\nLet me say two other things. The first is that there was a budget agreement that was reached last year, and we do expect members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- to keep that commitment, to keep their word. There were many people who were advocating the passage of that agreement last year, who are touting the benefits of a two-year agreement. So they kept their commitment in year one. We expect everybody to keep their commitment in year two.\nBut I would acknowledge the substance of your question, which is that this is a priority and it's complicated, and it requires a substantial commitment on behalf of U.S. taxpayers. So it will require the administration working with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to make sure that the needs of our men and women in uniform are properly met.\nQ: That budget agreement that you discussed was predicated on a previous assumption about troop levels that was different from the one that was announced today. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, when you're talking about working with Congress like that, are you going to now go back and ask for more money to fund these troops specifically?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our expectation right now is that given the strong support on Capitol Hill from Democrats and Republicans in Congress for this policy proposal, we anticipate that we should be able to all collectively, as political leaders, fulfill our responsibility to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the resources that they need to do their job and to keep us safe. And that will require Republicans doing something that they routinely find to be quite challenging, which is putting the country's priorities ahead of their own personal political considerations.\nBut in this case, the stakes are high enough that that's what they must do. And given their stated support for this policy, it shouldn't be that hard for them to do it.\nQ: And I just wanted to ask you about a report that the British did on Iraq and the lead-up to that that was pretty damning. It talked about flawed intelligence and wholly inadequate planning. This President was obviously pretty critical of how that war started as well. Do you concur with the results of that report?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, my understanding is that the report numbers some 6,000 pages. So I don't know that anybody in the U.S. government has had an opportunity to evaluate the entirety of the report. The President's longstanding opposition to the invasion of Iraq is well-known and has been extensively litigated.\nWhat is true is that President Obama has been dealing with the consequences of that fateful decision for the entirety of his presidency, and future presidents will likely have to do the same. So that certainly would -- I guess my point is, the fact that I haven't read the report does not mean that this is an inquiry that is not worthy of careful consideration. And it is important that certainly the United States -- I'll speak for our own country here -- learn the lessons of those past mistakes.\nBut what is also true is that the United States and the United Kingdom have a special relationship. And the ability of the leaders of our countries to work together to focus on our common interests and to pursue them jointly has made our countries more prosperous and more safe. And I would expect that that relationship will endure, regardless of who is leading the United States and the UK. Obviously, both countries are facing some leadership transitions in the months ahead. But even as both our countries go through those transitions, I would expect that that relationship will remain special and strong.\nJulia, nice to see you.\nQ: Thanks. Yesterday, FBI Director Comey said that while the FBI was not recommending charges against Hillary Clinton, he did say that it shouldn't be ruled out; that people who repeat that behavior in the future wouldn't be subject to security sanctions or administrative sanctions. What is the White House's view -- what's the Obama administration's view on what punishment should be in store, if not for these folks -- you might not want to talk about them -- but for future people, future staff members who don't follow the rules surrounding keeping classified emails secure?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, as we've discussed from here many times and across the administration, everybody who works in this administration understands how important it is to protect national security secrets and to handle sensitive information appropriately. And that is certainly a priority. And even as there are a number of agencies that have had to deal with situations like cyber intrusions, we have worked to update our technology and to ensure that our workforce understands the appropriate steps to take to protect that information. And our expectation is that's what the professionals who work at our national security agencies will continue to do.\nQ: What about some members of Hillary Clinton's staff who were part of these e-mails, who Director Comey said they would know they were classified? Should their security clearances be reviewed if, for example, they were about to come in and serve with the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm not going to render any judgment on that, primarily because these are the findings and recommendations of the FBI, based on their investigation that they have been conducting. The findings and recommendations of that investigation are still being considered by prosecutors at the Department of Justice, and we've gone to great lengths to prevent any undue White House influence on that situation. So it's just going to be hard for me to react to the specific findings and recommendations of the FBI at this point.\nQ: Okay. So, on Afghanistan, some critics have already come out since this morning's announcement of keeping 8,400 troops, saying that the White House really should be examining strategy, not troop levels, in order to achieve more success in Afghanistan. In the reviews that came before the President when he made this decision, was there any talk of changing any part of the strategy going forward? Or is he staying the course at the end of this administration just with this level of troops instead?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Julia, I think you heard the President reference in his statement to the fact that – you heard the President in his statement reference the fact that the President meets with his team on a regular basis to get an update on the situation in Afghanistan. In the context of those meetings, the President and his national security team, including commanders on the ground, review the strategy and they evaluate which aspects of that strategy are working effectively. They evaluate those aspects of the strategy that aren't working as effectively as intended, and they consider what changes need to be made.\nAnd there's always an ongoing effort to ensure that we are moving in the right direction and that we have a policy that is oriented to supporting the efforts of those who are bravely serving this country on the ground. And that's why the President listens so carefully to the advice that he receives from our commanders in Afghanistan and from the Department of Defense. I think today's announcement, in fact, reflects the recommendation that they put forward to the Commander-in-Chief.\nBut I guess to answer your question as directly as possible, there's an ongoing evaluation of the strategy because the President is determined to make sure that in order to do right by those who are putting their life on the line to protect the country that the Commander-in-Chief owes it to them to make sure that we've got the right strategy in place. And if there are aspects of our strategy that aren't working as well as intended, that we need to figure out why. And if that means we need to make changes to the strategy, the President won't hesitate to do so. If that means that we need to ask for greater contributions from our partners or our allies, the President won't hesitate to do so.\nBut the truth is, this situation in Afghanistan has improved because of the strategy that we do have in place. We did succeed in decimating core al Qaeda in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. We do have a much more effective partner in the Afghan central government because of the diplomatic efforts of officials at the State Department and other agencies. There is a much more effective Afghan security force, both in terms of law enforcement and military, that are doing a better job of securing the country.\nBut Afghanistan remains a dangerous place and there's still significant work that needs to be done, but there's no denying the progress that Afghanistan has made, and there's no denying the degree to which the safety of the United States has been enhanced because of the strategy that has been successfully implemented by President Obama and his national security team.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on the whole idea of security sanctions for Secretary Clinton. Yesterday, Paul Ryan said that he believed that Secretary Clinton should not be given classified briefings because she was extremely careless with classified information. He said that that should be the security penalty that she should receive. What's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my reaction is that I was specifically asked earlier this year about the wisdom of providing national security briefings to the Republican presidential nominee for President. Many people had raised questions about whether or not that was -- whether it was appropriate for the Republican nominee to receive those briefings. What I said at the time is that those kinds of decisions should be made by intelligence professionals who have a responsibility to set aside their own political considerations and focus on the best interest of the country.\nThe fact is, there is a longstanding tradition of providing briefings to the major party nominees to make a smooth transition much more likely in the event that either of them is elected President of the United States. There is a long tradition of those briefings being presented without political influence. And what the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has indicated is that they expect those briefings to move forward after the party conventions, after the parties have chosen a nominee. And the expectation that the DNI has is that they'll provide the same information to both candidates.\nSo that is the most effective way to handle this situation. When we're talking about the safety and security of classified information, we should leave those decisions in the hands of our intelligence professionals and not risk them being sullied by the political debate.\nQ: -- political influence in the political debate. Director Comey and the Attorney General have been sort of called up to the Hill to testify about this case. Do you think that's a good idea? You mentioned that it's an ongoing case and you don't want to talk too much about it, but they've agreed to talk about this case on the Hill, publicly.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, a couple things about that. The first is that the administration has, I think by any impartial measure, gone to great lengths to cooperate with even the most unfair of congressional inquiries. That is just -- that's the principle that we have lived by. What is also true is that Director Comey and Attorney General Lynch are going to make decisions based on their own expertise and their own judgment about the best way to cooperate with that Congressional oversight. They understand the importance of protecting the independence of their investigations -- Director Comey said as much yesterday in his statement.\nThat certainly is a consequence of the lengths that we have gone to here at the White House to prevent any undue outside influence from the White House on this ongoing matter. But as it relates to congressional influence and whether it is undue or inappropriate, I've got confidence in the ability of the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI to protect the integrity and independence of those investigations. They've been doing that for quite some time now and I'm confident that they can do so as this process continues.\nQ: And just one more on the e-mail situation. One of the things that Director Comey mentioned is that there were several work-related emails that were deleted by Secretary Clinton's lawyers as personal. We know that Secretary Clinton has had all of her work-related emails, the ones that she declared so far, already released. Do you believe that those work-related emails that were deleted should be released as well to the public in the same way that the previous emails were released?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, what the information that you've provided that you're asking about is information that has come to light as the result of the ongoing FBI investigation. And because the results of that investigation and the recommendations that arise from that investigation are still being considered by prosecutors at the Department of Justice, I'm just not going to be in a position to react to those details at this point.\nQ: Do you anticipate that, more broadly, when this investigation is over, you'll be able to discuss these types of questions and answer these questions sort of when the investigation is over, kind of discuss this in a more robust way than you are now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, whenever I walk out here, I always endeavor to answer your questions to the best of my ability. In this case, there are going to be obvious limitations to that in part because I haven't seen any of the emails; in part because I wasn't privy to the decisions that were made about Secretary Clinton's email system; in part because what we're focused on when I'm standing behind this podium is the official work of the United States government, not the presidential campaign, and certainly many of the questions that have arisen have been the result of political charges that have been traded back and forth in the context of the campaign. I'm not saying that's inappropriate. I would expect a spirited debate on the campaign trail. But the focus of our time and attention in this room is on the official conduct of U.S. government business.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, if the situation in Afghanistan is as precarious as President Obama says, why make any reductions in troop levels at all? Why not leave it at 9,800?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, this is actually based on the recommendation from our commanders on the ground about what resources are necessary to conduct the missions that the Commander-in-Chief has given them. Those missions are to provide training and assistance to the Afghan security forces and to maintain the kind of counterterrorism platform that's necessary to counter those extremists that may be plotting in Afghanistan against Western interests around the world.\nSo the President has been very clear about what that mission is. The Department of Defense came forward with a specific recommendation about the number of resources and the number of military servicemembers that would be required to carry out that mission. That number was a little over 8,400 and that's what the President has authorized.\nQ: May I ask about yesterday? His campaign event -- what is the policy of the White House about the use and display of the presidential seal at political events?\nMR. EARNEST: At the White House, frankly, we have tried -- we have treated the presidential seal consistent with the way that previous Presidents have, which is that it is certainly used at official events and sometimes used at political events. That's been the case throughout the last seven years and, again, that is a precedent that dates back at least to President Truman.\nThe commitment that we've made before and that I would expect that we would continue to uphold is to not put the seal on the podium when the President is speaking at a fundraiser, when he is soliciting donations for political causes. And I think that's a line that we've kept to over the last seven years. But that's -- it may be aggrandizing it to describe that as a policy, but that is a description of the way that we handle this matter.\nQ: How did you decide to use the seal yesterday? Do you know if the Clinton campaign asked for the seal so that the candidate could be seen speaking behind it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any such requests from the Clinton campaign.\nQ: Does the same policy exist for the Vice President and his seal when he campaigns for the candidate Friday?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not asked the Vice President's team about what policy they expect to have in place, but we can certainly check with them, or you can check with them, and get an answer, or we can just tune in on Friday. (Laughter.)\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about opioid legislation. Now that House and the Senate Republicans have voted down additional funding to attach to that bill, would the President veto that package if it landed on his desk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, the thing that I find at least somewhat surprising is the way that Republicans in Congress continue to abdicate their basic responsibility to address an emergency. Democrats and Republicans all around the country have identified the opioid epidemic in the United States as an emergency. Public health professionals have identified this as an emergency. Mayors and governors all across the country, Democrats and Republicans, have identified the opioid epidemic in America as an emergency. Republican presidential candidates have campaigned in states across the country earlier this year and talked about how the opioid epidemic in America required a robust response. Somehow, that message has not gotten through to congressional Republicans.\nThe administration has gone to great lengths to try to do what we can, using the President executive authority, to try to enhance the fight against the opioid epidemic. Just yesterday, there was an announcement of a couple of steps that the Department of Health and Human Services was taking to give physicians the authority to offer medication-assisted treatment to more patients. There were announcements from the VA and the Department of Defense to improve prescription drug monitoring to prevent people from becoming addicted to opioids.\nSo many people all along the ideological spectrum in both parties are making the case about how this is an urgent priority. But it's only Republicans in Congress that are deaf to those calls. And I'm not really sure why. There are patriotic Americans in Democratic and Republican congressional districts who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic. There are people in America right now who know they have an addiction, who have sought treatment and are unable to get it because beds in treatment facilities are not available to them.\nEveryone who has spent any time looking at this issue understands that additional resources are necessary in the form of hospital beds and public health professionals to treat this problem. Thousands of Americans are in need of assistance. And passing a bill that is doing little more than paying lip service to the problem falls woefully short of Congress's basic responsibility.\nDemocrats have been fighting for additional resources. You'll recall that the President of the United States put forward a comprehensive proposal to fight opioid addiction in his budget. And I don't have to remind you that that billion-dollar proposal was something that Republicans in Congress were unwilling to even discuss. They canceled a hearing that had that the past 40 Congresses had previously held to evaluate the President's budget proposal. For 40 years in a row, that meeting had been held, but Republicans wouldn't even give the President's budget director the opportunity to discuss the President's budget and to discuss his specific proposal.\nSo Republicans don't take this seriously, and I don't understand why. So we'll see what gets passed out of conference. But if there is a bill that reaches the President's desk that is geared toward fighting the opioid epidemic but doesn't include any funding, I certainly cannot promise that the President would sign it. So we'll see what they do, but hopefully Republicans in Congress will listen to the calls from Democrats and Republicans alike who are asking for more resources to deal with this significant emergency.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I have two subjects I want to ask you -- two total different subjects. First, I want to go back to yesterday. How did -- give us a little color off of Air Force One. How did the conversation, or the issuing of the Comey statement come up yesterday with the President and Secretary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Good, this is the easiest question I'm going to get all day. It did not come up.\nQ: So you mean to tell me they were on the plane traveling to Charlotte, never talked about it on the plane, not even when they had broke bread and had barbeque together?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Secretary Clinton did not fly back on Air Force One with President Obama. So presumably she got to --\nQ: They had barbeque at the restaurant.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they got it to go, so, presumably, she was able to enjoy it on her own plane. I know that some members of the President's staff enjoyed the barbeque on Air Force One on the flight back to Washington yesterday. It was excellent.\nBut, no, the President takes quite seriously the need to avoid the appearance of outside influence on an ongoing investigation. The FBI Director has indicated that they have completed the investigation, but the results of that investigation and the recommendations that spring from that recommendation are still being evaluate by prosecutors at the Department of Justice. So the President did not discuss this matter with Secretary Clinton.\nAgain, the President and his views on this matter are not relevant because the decision that prosecutors at the Department of Justice will make will be rooted in their own expertise, their own evaluation of the facts and the evidence. And that's how they will reach their conclusions. They will do that independent of their own political preferences, and they will certainly do that independent of any preferences that the President has.\nBut the President takes this quite seriously, and it was not discussed by the President and Secretary Clinton on the flight yesterday.\nQ: Next subject. Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Alton Sterling. The President is a huge partaker of social media. Has he seen this video that has gone viral of Alton Sterling's death at the hands of police in Baton Rouge?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is aware of the situation. I do not know whether or not he has watched the video. April, as you probably know, the Department of Justice announced just this morning that they would be taking a close look at this matter. And again, for reasons that are not dissimilar from what we were discussing earlier, I'm just not going to be able to comment in a lot of detail on this situation given the fact that the Department of Justice has said that they're going to take a look at the situation.\nBut obviously the President is aware of this. And regardless of what this investigation finds, there is a family in Baton Rouge and there is a community that is grieving right now. And obviously our thoughts and prayers are with the family that's lost a loved one.\nQ: So you say the President has been made very aware of this -- well, he's aware of this. Could you tell us how? Because he started an office, My Brother's Keeper, because of situations like this. Could you tell me how he was made aware, and what has he said? And could you talk to us about the process as it relates to a possible (inaudible) or law violation that the Justice Department is looking at?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the Department of Justice talk about the process. Again, it is a process that they're going to conduct independent of any White House judgment about the situation.\nBut look, the President is aware of it, but I don't have a specific reaction to the news to share with you.\nQ: And how was he made aware of it? Did Broderick Johnson, the head of My Brother's Keeper, tell him? Did Valerie Jarrett send him an email? I mean, how did he find out?\nMR. EARNEST: No, this incident has obviously garnered significant media attention, and that's how the President is aware of it.\nMark.\nQ: Back to the emails and congressional hearings. Is it appropriate for Congress, members of Congress to call before hearings the lead investigator and the Attorney General? Is there a danger of them asserting political influence that you say the President is so keen to avoid?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you're raising a legitimate question, but it's one at this point that I'm just not going to be in a position to comment on given the fact that what the FBI Director will presumably be asked to discuss is the findings of his investigation and the recommendation that that investigation prompted to the Department of Justice. And given that those findings and that recommendation are still being evaluated by the Department of Justice, I'm reluctant to weigh in on it at this point.\nQ: Speaker Ryan said that he should supply a point-by-point justification for the things he said yesterday. Is that appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- again, the FBI Director did speak to this investigation at some length yesterday. Many people have observed that that is not the standard practice. But there is little about this matter that is standard, you might say. So I think the FBI Director did have an opportunity to be quite transparent with the American public about the investigation that was conducted, how it was conducted, what they found, and what they recommended to the Department of Justice. But I'm just not going to be able to speak on this matter given that the findings and recommendations are still under review by the professionals at the Department of Justice.\nQ: So what do you think of Donald Trump's assertion that letting Clinton off the hook represents bribery of the Attorney General?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific reaction to Mr. Trump's comments on this matter. Thank you for giving me the opportunity, though.\nSuzanne.\nQ: I want to follow up on April's question about Baton Rouge. Louisiana Governor Edwards said that there were a number of White House officials who reached out to him this morning. Was the President one of them? Has the President talked to the Governor? And why has the Justice Department reacted with such speed in terms of taking over the investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has not made any calls to the Louisiana Governor on this matter. I can tell you that the White House officials that did place calls placed those calls prior to the announcement from the Department of Justice about the ongoing investigation. Now that the investigation is underway I would not anticipate extensive conversations about this matter between the White House and any Louisiana officials, again, out of respect for the independent Department of Justice investigation.\nFor the decision and speed with which the decision was made by the Department of Justice to take a close look at this matter, I'd refer you to officials at the Department of Justice. They reached that decision on their own and based on their knowledge of the facts. But exactly what factored into that decision and the timing for that decision being announced, that's something that they'll have to speak to.\nQ: Some of those officials, including the police chief, felt like it wasn't necessary, that, according to him, that he didn't need hand-holding and that type of thing. Is there any sense that there's some pushback for the Justice Department getting involved?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the police chief speak to his perspective. Obviously, the Department of Justice has made a decision based on their own expertise and based on their own knowledge of the situation to conduct an investigation. But how they reached that decision, I'll leave it to them to explain.\nQ: So back to the President. The video of what we did see is another African American man on the ground being shot and killed by police officers. It is under investigation, which we know, but the family held a press conference in which his 15-yeaer-old son wailed and broke down at the loss of his father.\nMR. EARNEST: It's heartbreaking.\nQ: Heartbreaking. Has the President seen that particular video? And just to a larger point, what does he think? What is his reaction in response to something like that happening again in our country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, in response to April's question, I noted earlier the pain that is obviously being felt by this family and by this community in Baton Rouge. And we're thinking about them as they endure that grief.\nBut as it relates to the facts of the situation, I'm just not going to be able to get into it because the Department of Justice has taking a look at that. But this is something that the President is aware of. I don't know if he saw the news conference, but I'm certain that he's aware of the news. But we're obviously going to be deferential to the decision-making at the Department of Justice about how to pursue justice in this matter.\nMegan.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You're getting a lot of questions about what the President has watched in the past 24 hours. Has he watched Comey's news conference from yesterday in its entirety?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't believe the President had the opportunity to watch it in its entirety in real time. There was obviously extensive news coverage of it. Those of us who did watch his news conference in real time had an opportunity to describe the news conference to him, so he certainly is aware of what transpired. But I don't believe he got to watch the entire news conference from beginning to end.\nQ: How did he describe it?\nMR. EARNEST: Keep going, Megan.\nQ: I want to take another crack at the reaction to the congressional inquiry -- inquiries -- surrounding this. What about this as a use of members of Congress in terms of their time? Do you see an issue with members of Congress focusing on this particular issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, you have heard me express significant concerns about the inattention that Congress has placed on things like funding for the opioid epidemic, and to make sure that individuals who are seeking treatment can get access to a hospital bed before they die. You have heard me discuss how important it is for Congress to act on a request that was put forward by public health professionals to fight the Zika virus. There are pregnant women and newborn babies all across the country that are at risk, and the fact is our public health professionals have not been able to do every single thing possible to protect us because they haven't gotten adequate resources and adequate funding from the United States Congress. In fact, they've gotten basically nothing from the United States Congress. I know there is essentially a talking point, though, that Congress has previously passed on Zika, but that's not going to actually get them the resources that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people.\nWe've certainly talked at length about how Republicans in the Senate have not done their job and given a hearing to the President's eminently qualified nominee to the Supreme Court. This individual is, based on his 19 years on the federal bench, somebody that I've described as the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in history, somebody that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. But yet, more than half of the Republican conference won't even meet with the man. They won't even have a conversation with him, let alone fulfill their official responsibilities to give him a hearing and give him a yes or no vote.\nSo there are -- again, without talking about the FBI investigation or the Director's decision to travel to Capitol Hill and talk to members of Congress about this, I'll just make the simple observation that there are significant other priorities that have languished, that Republicans have ignored, the kind of things that should be far beyond any sort of partisan wrangling. But that's, unfortunately, not how they have spent their time.\nQ: Are you then characterizing --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I would hesitate to characterize the interaction that Director Comey is scheduled to have with Congress later this week, simply because the investigation that he'll be discussing and the recommendations that he ostensibly will be discussing are still being considered by lawyers at the Department of Justice.\nQ: And I did have one question on 2016 campaigning and what's ahead for the President. Is he going to be campaigning for House and Senate candidates as well? And what's the planning there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any additional events to announce. I can tell you the President is quite interested in making a strong case to Democrats all across the country. It was probably evident to those of you who watched the President's remarks yesterday. So I would certainly confirm your analysis if that's what your conclusion was.\nSo the President is obviously quite enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton's campaign. He described that at some length yesterday. The President is also pretty enthusiastic about a number of Democratic candidates for the Senate and House, as well. And he, I'm confident, will have an opportunity to make his case on their behalf, as well. He certainly is looking forward to that opportunity.\nQ: And then I'd like to hear a little bit more of the description in the back and forth on Comey's announcement.\nMR. EARNEST: So you yield your time to Mr. Nichols.\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Hans, go ahead.\nQ: How do you describe it, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President had not seen it, and I certainly described what I saw, which is the FBI Director offering a detailed public description of what his investigators had done, what they had found, and what they had recommended to the Department of Justice. Again, what was quite clear from the beginning of his statement is that he was going to go into quite a lot of detail -- and he did. And it certainly was not clear, I don't think to anybody, by the Director's own admission, exactly what the recommendation was going to be until he announced what it was. And that's how I described it.\nQ: Can you give us any adjectives he used, other than \"quite\"?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks. If I could follow up for just a second. It seems to me --\nQ: Ask about adverbs.\nQ: Yeah, I should -- adverbs. (Laughter.) It seemed to me that Director Comey suggested without saying -- maybe using Washington speak -- that the Secretary lied about a number of her statements previously made about her server -- about why she used it, about whether or not classified material had been sent marked classified. He cited over 100 of those. As the leader of the party, how did the President take it when he heard that about the person that he was then going to go out and tell the people of North Carolina and, ostensibly, the people of America that this is someone you should place your trust in?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I just don't have a presidential reaction to the investigation to share. And the reason for that is the investigation is still being evaluated by Department of Justice prosecutors.\nBut as it relates to the President's feelings about Secretary Clinton, the President had an opportunity to speak about them at length yesterday in Charlotte. And the President made a forceful and compelling case for someone that he has gotten to see in action, up close. He made his case in support of somebody who he started out running against and now strongly supports. And that's a pretty powerful story, particularly when you consider the President's own perspective.\nAs the President talked about yesterday, you don't really know what it's like to be President until you've had to sit behind that desk, in the Oval Office, and make those weighty decisions. Many of those weighty decisions are not something that are discussed publicly every day but do have a significant impact on the American people.\nAnd the President, I think, made a robust case for why he believes that Secretary Clinton is the right person to inherit that responsibility.\nQ: You have may have been asked this already, but just if I might: Was there any tipoff at all that this was going to go the way that it went? And the reason I ask is I'm wondering what the contingency -- what had been, say, had the outcome been different -- would the President have continued and gone on, and done the event with the Secretary as planned?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I did mention this yesterday. The White House did not receive any advance notice of Director Comey's remarks. There was no advance notice given to the White House about the recommendations that Director Comey was prepared to give to the Department of Justice. In fact, there was not advance notice given to the White House that Director Comey was planning to speak, let alone what he was going to say.\nSo that all said, no, I'm not aware of any contingency plans that were in place. There was never a discussion that I was a part of that the President's schedule would be changed in any way.\nQ: VA report out today by the Commission on Care. And among the many things that were written in that report -- it was pretty damning, to be blunt -- it said that there were many profound deficiencies, that it requires urgent reform, and despite the fact that billions have been sent on making improvements, in some cases things have gotten worse. What's the White House reaction to the report as it is now? And what, if anything, can be done to improve the conditions for the VA and Care veterans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, what I would say is that at the administration we're not going be satisfied until every veteran across the country can get access to the benefits and health care that they deserve. And the truth is, over the last two years we've made important progress in making that a reality. The fact is that the VA has reduced the backlog of disability compensation by 90 percent over the last three years. The VA has dramatically improved the wait times for veterans who are seeking medical appointments.\nThere are a lot of metrics I can share, but about 97 percent of appointments are now completed within 30 days of the veteran's preferred date for that appointment to occur. Twenty-two percent of those appointments are scheduled on the same day. The average wait time for primary care is about five days. The average wait time for specialty care is about six days. That's a pretty good track record, particularly when you compare it to the private sector. And I think that would explain why nearly 90 percent of veterans, according to a recent survey, said that they are either satisfied or completely satisfied with the timeliness of their scheduled appointments.\nSo that, I think, is a clear indication of the critically important progress that has been made thus far. But look, there is no one in the administration who is going to be satisfied until this job is completed. So we're pleased with the progress, but there's no denying that there's a lot of important work that remains to be done.\nQ: And lastly, on Afghanistan. The number that you mentioned -- in 2011, more than 100,000 Americans at that point serving in Afghanistan -- has continued to dwindle down. Is there any disappointment in the fact that still, after 15 years, there are more than 8,000 Americans that will still be serving in this theater?\nMR. EARNEST: Afghanistan continues to be a dangerous place. And we've made a lot of important progress in strengthening the Afghan central government, enhancing the capacity of Afghan security forces to fight for their own country, and to preserve the ability of the United States military to take action against extremists and against terrorists to protect the United States and our interests around the world.\nWe've been able to do that, even as we have followed through on a responsible drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The drawdown is not all the way to zero, but we've drawn down more than 92 percent -- or about 92 percent of our previous commitment just in the last four years or so. So that's an indication that we've made a lot of important progress in Afghanistan, both substantively in terms of the results that we'd like to see on the ground, but also in terms of following through on the President's promise to find a responsible way to bring our servicemen and women home.\nQ: For the record, it's Goyal's birthday. You may want to give him a shout-out.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, okay. Well, maybe we'll give him a birthday question here near the end. (Laughter.)\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. If the FBI determined that a current member of the President's Cabinet or another top official was extremely careless with classified information, would the President expect that official to resign, or ask him or her to resign?\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, I just don't have a response to that hypothetical question.\nQ: Given that a number of other members of this administration have resigned for far less -- including your OPM director over a data breach, your Secret Service director over security breaches, your VA Secretary over a wait time scandal, a top Afghanistan general over comments to a magazine -- yet here you have a member of your administration being accused of carelessness, and the President has endorsed her to succeed him. How do you square that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President squared it yesterday in his remarks. The President made a forceful case for why he believes that she is the best person in the country to succeed him as President of the United States. And he had an opportunity to watch her up close, in action. And they started out running against each other. That relationship evolved into the two of them working together to advance our interests around the world. And now the President is pleased to offer his full-throated endorsement for her to succeed him. And the President talked about her experience and her priorities and her values that she's dedicated her career to fighting for.\nSo the President spoke in his own words about why exactly he believes she should be the next President of the United States. I think the President did that with obvious zeal yesterday, and I would anticipate that he'll continue to do that up and including on Election Day.\nQ: I got this email from someone who says he worked for a Department of Energy lab. He writes, \"I would have lost my security clearance and ultimately my job if I was simply careless with classified information.\" I feel like that's a common sentiment in the civil service around the government. Is the White House willing to say right now that what Secretary Clinton did was a major error in judgment? And are you willing to warn all current members of the administration not to do similar things -- run their own private email servers and conduct government business on unclassified email?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, we've made clear what the policy is as it relates to the use of government email, and our expectation is that individuals who serve in the administration are using their government email for official purposes. In those rare instances in which government email is either not accessible or otherwise unavailable, use of personal email should be limited, and in each instance, that personal email should be transferred to the official government system as soon as possible so that it can be properly archived. That's been our policy for a long time and our expectation is that that's what employees will follow as they conduct the official business of the United States government. That certainly is the policy that I follow, and everyone else does, too.\nBut again, you're asking other questions that are related directly to the assessment that was made by the FBI Director based on their investigation and it's just not something I can react to. As long as that assessment and investigation and recommendations are being considered by prosecutors at the Department of Justice.\nQ: You can't warn federal employees that they shouldn't be careless with classified information?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I've just reiterated what our policy is and, in response to a previous question, discussed how much of a priority we have placed on the careful handling of sensitive information. But as it relates to the investigation that was completed by the FBI, we'll let that be evaluated by prosecutors at the Department of Justice and avoid any sort of outside or undue influence from the White House -- something that we've successfully done for the last year or so. And we certainly want to make sure that we do that up to the conclusion of this matter.\nJan.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, I mean, Secretary Clinton has said that this was absolutely permitted by the State Department. But in light of the policy that you kind of outlined, which I assume was in place or that she knew about -- I mean, did she seek legal guidance from the Counsel's Office? Or was the Counsel's Office totally caught off guard?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I have zero knowledge of the decisions that Secretary Clinton and her team made in setting up her email system.\nQ: But I mean, what about the White House Counsel's Office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not aware of who Secretary Clinton and her team may have consulted with this matter, but you can certainly check with them on that. But the policy was in place and has been in place since the beginning.\nQ: So she would have been aware of that policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, you'd have to ask her if she was aware of it, but it certainly was in place.\nQ: Okay, I'm just trying to -- but you have no knowledge of whether she, with this policy in place, consulted with, say, the White House Counsel's Office of any White House legal staff or team about whether or not something that may be a little different would be acceptable?\nMR. EARNEST: Who Secretary Clinton may have consulted you should get from her team.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, neither President Obama, nor Secretary Clinton, during the campaign appearance yesterday, articulated their opposition in North Carolina's anti-LGBT House Bill 2. Meanwhile, Donald Trump said yesterday during a rally event he's a friend of the gay community, but then later told reporters he's with the state on HB-2. Did the President miss an opportunity to contrast the Democrats to Trump by not speaking out against the law?\nMR. EARNEST: Chris, I think this -- again, the Department of Justice has gotten a lot of air time today. But as you know, this is a matter that is being considered by legal authorities in the administration, so that certainly contributed to the President's decision not to raise it in public yesterday.\nQ: But do you have any reaction to Donald Trump saying in one night he's a friend of the gay community and also with the state on House Bill 2?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not have a reaction to Mr. Trump today.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask you about something the President said at the rally yesterday. He was talking about what a great Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was -- he said, \"That was before the whole political machinery got moving. It's funny how the filter changes a bit -- same person, done the same work -- but that filter is a powerful thing.\" Was he referring in any way to the email investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: No, Dave, I think what the President was referring to was that Secretary Clinton's approval ratings and the willingness of Republicans to work with her was evident while she was serving as Secretary of State. And her political standing was strong, her approval ratings obviously grew. Many people, including people in this room, observed that her approval rating as Secretary of State was higher than the President that she serves, and there was a willingness on the part of many Republicans to work with her effectively to advance our interests around the globe.\nBut obviously, that all changed once she left government service. And, again, I think that is a function of our political system right now -- that Republicans who were willing to work effectively with her while she was Secretary of State are now harshly criticizing her. I'll leave that to all of them to explain why that is the case, but that's what the President was referring to. He wasn't referring to this specific matter.\nQ: -- email investigation by the Department of Justice had nothing to do with her disapproval ratings going up?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think the -- I think the point that the President was making yesterday -- I'm just not going to talk about the investigation to the email system. The point that the President was making is that her service as Secretary of State is something that won her strong support all across the country because she served the country well, because she served the President well, because she succeeded in advancing our interests around the globe in a variety of settings. And the President is certainly proud of her service and that is what contributed to his decision to strongly endorse her candidacy for President.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Last week, you mentioned that the President had talked to congressional leaders about a Zika package. How would you describe those conversations -- a negotiation now, or he is just continuing to push the original request?\nMR. EARNEST: I would describe them as intensely frustrating because our public health professionals have been blunt about what resources they need to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus, and Republicans, for some reason, haven't gotten the message. And when I say Republicans, I'm referring to Republicans in Congress. Republican mayors and Republican governors and particularly in the South, where the mosquito population is larger have definitely gotten the message.\nWe've seen a bipartisan group of governors write a letter to Congress, urging them to act on the President's funding request. We have seen even some Republican members of the Senate strongly support the President's budget proposal.\nRepublicans ran for the job of serving the country in the United States Senate. They made what they thought was a strong case about how the country would benefit from a Republican majority in the House and the Senate. That comes with it significant responsibilities, including making sure that our country has the resources necessary to deal with an emergency. And when faced with this significant emergency, Republicans have not acted on the specific request that our public health professionals have made for funding. And the President has been quite disappointed by all that.\nQ: It looks like Congress will get out of town next week without passing anything. Is the administration preparing another reprogramming request?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any significant plan B here. The fact is, significant resources are required and the administration has already tried to reprogram some $600 million from other accounts to try to bridge the gap. But there's a whole lot more that is not being done because Republicans haven't acted. And that is contrary to the best advice that we've gotten from our public health professionals. This doesn't have anything to do with politics; it doesn't have anything to do with political parties, but it should have everything to do with Republicans in Congress fulfilling their basic responsibilities to the American people. And thus far, they have dropped the ball.\nI'll give the birthday boy the last one here. Happy birthday, Goyal.\nQ: Thank you. How about my question on this, my birthday, that I need blessings from all my colleagues at the White House, from you and the President and your White House press office. That's all my question today, the blessing.\nMR. EARNEST: All right, well, we'll find a way to get those to you before the end of the day.\nHave a good day, everybody.\nEND 2:38 P.M.

Inhofe, R-OK)\nThe Administration strongly opposes S. 3100. This bill fails to offer comprehensive reforms needed to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws, and undermines current Administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals and national security threats, and to work collaboratively with State and local law enforcement agencies.\nThe Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration system through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to strengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines legal immigration, increases the efficiency of the immigration court system, and offers an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of the line. While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over three years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan Senate bill would grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $1 trillion over 20 years. The Administration continues to urge the Congress to address all of the problems with the Nation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation that will offer meaningful solutions to those problems.\nThe Administration also believes the most effective way to enhance public safety is through sensible and effective policies that focus enforcement resources on the most significant public safety threats. The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that accomplish this important law enforcement goal by focusing limited resources on the worst offenders – including national security threats, convicted criminals, and gang members. The effectiveness of these new priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement. Every day, the Federal government fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of mechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task forces. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration enforcement to work with State and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who are enforcement priorities before those individuals are released into communities. PEP builds collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement that allows for the most effective enforcement while enhancing community policing and trust. It is not a \"one-size-fits all\" approach. These efforts are producing results. Today, over 99 percent of those in immigration detention fit within one of the enforcement priorities, and 91 percent of all interior removals in FY 2015 were convicted criminals. Additionally, the vast majority of the Nation's approximately 3,100 local law enforcement agencies are collaborating with DHS. This bill would directly undermine these efforts and undo the progress made in building trust between Federal, State and local law enforcement in focusing our resources on threats to public safety.\nS. 3100 would also jeopardize the ability of State and local governments to receive Federal funding that is critical to their efforts to grow and revitalize their communities. For some jurisdictions, it would deny funding for cities to implement a wide range of community development, infrastructure, and housing activities and provide vital public services, including meals to the elderly and affordable child care for low-income, working families. The bill also would deem State and local law enforcement officials to act as the agents of Federal immigration law enforcement—and to have the authority of Federal immigration law enforcement officials— in certain circumstances. The Administration believes that these provisions would lead to mistrust between communities and State and local law enforcement agencies; undermine the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe across the country; and impede our efforts to safely, fairly, and effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws.\nIf the President were presented with S. 3100, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-07-06", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 3100 - Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act"}

For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has deployed historic levels of front-line personnel, technology, and infrastructure to the border to reduce the flow of unlawful migration and illicit contraband while fostering legal trade and travel. DHS is pursuing a Department-wide strategy that marshals resources from across the agency along the Southern Border and draws on experienced law enforcement officials. The Department has put in place effective new enforcement priorities to ensure that its limited resources are focused on apprehending, detaining, and removing the worst offenders—national security threats, convicted criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118067", "text": "Action from Congress urgently needed to provide resources for treatment\nAs Congress moves to conference on legislation related to the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, the Obama Administration is taking additional actions to expand access to treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring, enable safe disposal of unneeded drugs, and accelerate research on pain and opioid misuse and overdose.\nThe President has made clear that addressing this epidemic is a priority for his Administration. While Federal agencies have been using their authority to take every available action they can, Congress needs to take action on what is most urgently needed now - additional funding to make lifesaving treatment available to everyone who seeks it. The President has called for $1.1 billion in new funding to help Americans who want treatment get it wherever they live. These maps show how much new funding for treatment each State could potentially qualify for if Congress passes what the President has requested.\nEvery day that passes without Congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to get treatment to those who want it, help prevent overdoses and support communities across the country impacted by this epidemic. Recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders is possible, and many Americans are able to recover because they get the treatment and care they need. But too many still are not able to get treatment. That's why the President has called on Congress to provide the resources needed to ensure that every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment can get it and start the road to recovery.\nExpanding Access to Treatment:\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, is issuing a final rule to increase from 100 to 275 the number of patients that qualified physicians who prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorders can treat. Providers, policymakers, advocates, and experts have pointed to the current 100 patient limit for buprenorphine prescribing as a barrier to opioid use disorder treatment. The rule aims to increase access to medication-assisted treatment and associated behavioral health supports for tens of thousands of people with opioid use disorders, while preventing diversion.\nImproving Prescription Drug Monitoring by Federal Prescribers:\n• Indian Health Service: While many Indian Health Service (IHS) clinicians already utilize Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), IHS will now require its opioid prescribers and pharmacists to check their State PDMP databases prior to prescribing or dispensing any opioid for more than seven days. The new policy is effective immediately for more than 1,200 IHS clinicians working in IHS federally operated facilities who are authorized to prescribe opioids. Checking a PDMP before prescribing helps to improve appropriate pain management care, identify patients who may have an opioid use disorder and prevent diversion of drugs. This policy builds on other IHS efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In December, IHS announced that it would provide hundreds of Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officers with the lifesaving opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone and train them how to use it.\n• Department of Veterans Affairs: As part of its efforts to prevent and treat opioid use disorder among Veterans, VA is releasing a new policy for its health care providers who prescribe controlled substances that requires them (or where allowed their delegate) in most cases to check State PDMPs prior to deciding to prescribe a new controlled substance to determine if a patient is receiving opioids or other controlled substances from another provider and document that in the electronic patient record. These checks will occur at a minimum once a year and/or when clinically indicated for each renewal or continuation of therapy. VA provides health care services to approximately 8.3 million veterans at 150 medical centers, nearly 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics, community living centers, Vet Centers and Domiciliaries.\n• Department of Defense: By the end of November 2016, DOD will have conducted an evaluation of its prescription drug monitoring program to assess its ability to capture community providers and use of cash transitions; identify any gaps in comprehensive use of prescription drug monitoring strategies; and make recommendations for closing those gaps.\nAdvancing Prescriber Education:\nOne of the ways HHS is working to stem the overprescribing of opioids is by providing prescribers with access to the tools and education they need to make informed decisions. Today HHS is releasing a Request for Information that seeks provider, consumer and other public comments on current HHS prescriber education and training programs and proposals for potential future activities through programs such as Medicare.\nEncouraging Safe Pain Management Approaches:\nHHS continues to work to better educate providers and patients about safe pain management. Health care providers have expressed concern that scores on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey pain management questions are tied to Medicare payments to hospitals, even though those payments currently have a very limited connection to the survey's pain management questions. However, to prevent any potential confusion on the part of providers, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing to remove the HCAHPS survey pain management questions from the hospital scoring calculation. This means that hospitals would continue to use the questions to survey patients about their in-patient pain management experience, but these questions would not affect the level of payment hospitals receive.\nAccelerating Research on Pain and Opioid Misuse and Overdose:\nHHS is launching more than a dozen new scientific studies on opioid abuse and pain treatment to help fill knowledge gaps and further improve the Administration's ability to fight this epidemic. As part of this announcement, the Department will release a report and inventory on the opioid abuse and pain treatment research being conducted or funded by its agencies in order to provide policy-makers, researchers, and other stakeholders with the full scope of HHS activities in this area.\nExpanding Telemedicine in Rural America:\nLast week, the Department of Agriculture announced nearly $1.4 million for five Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grant awards to Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia to help rural areas address the opioid epidemic. USDA plans to announce funding for additional DLT projects this summer. In addition to DLT investments, USDA Rural Development has funded rural hospitals and health care clinics from its Community Facilities and Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Programs. These projects provide communities with much-needed services to help address health care, including overdose and opioid use disorder.\nSafely Disposing of Unneeded Prescription Opioids:\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has announced it will hold its 12th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day on Saturday, October 22, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs. More than 6.4 million pounds of medication have been collected over the last eleven Take Back Days. Local communities and some pharmacies are also establishing ongoing drug take-back programs.\nImproving Housing Support for Americans in Recovery:\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development, in partnership with the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness and HHS, is identifying best practices to support individuals using medication-assisted treatment in programs funded through HUD's Homelessness Assistance Grants to promote replication of best practices throughout the country. HUD also will work with its Continuums of Care partners to help individuals with prescription opioid or heroin use disorders and use housing to support recovery.", "timestamp": "2016-07-06", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Takes More Actions to Address the Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic"}

The Precision Medicine Initiative will pioneer a new model of patient-powered research that promises to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools, knowledge, and therapies to select which treatments will work best for which patients.\nPrecision medicine is the ability to tailor both prevention strategies and treatment decisions to an individual's unique characteristics. Examples of this include, cancer specialists identifying the most effective drug or treatment based on the specific genetic change in a patient's cancer. Care teams remotely monitoring blood glucose levels and analyzing trends to help patients manage or even prevent diabetes. And when prescription drugs are needed to treat an illness, individualized information being used to make sure the right drug is given at the right dose.\nToday, the Administration is announcing new investments, partnerships, and policies that aim to bring us significantly closer to our goal—using technology and the power of people. These steps include:\n• $55 million in new awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to health care provider organizations, technology developers, and community health centers to launch the major steps to recruit a million or more voluntary research participants as partners into the PMI Cohort Program.\n• A Food and Drug Administration proposal to streamline its oversight of genomic tests to respond to emerging technology while continuing to ensure safety and effectiveness; and\n• The development of tools and technology to make data accessible and usable for researchers and participants.\nThese new milestones follow  actions taken earlier this year by the Federal Government, the private sector, and non-profit organizations to advance precision medicine. These steps included actions by the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and more than 40 private sector organizations. Research participants will be essential partners in PMI, donating their time, energy, and health information. Recognizing the important role that individuals play in PMI, the Administration is making it a priority to protect the privacy and security of the information that will be donated by PMI research participants. Toward this effort, the White House released  privacy and data security principles to guide activities under PMI.\nSteps to Recruit More than a Million Research Volunteers in PMI\nThe PMI Cohort Program is a landmark longitudinal research effort that will engage at least a million people in the United States to improve our ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in genetics, environment, and lifestyle. Participants will be able to join the cohort either through partner healthcare organizations that have existing relationships in their communities or by enrolling directly through a computer, smartphone, or call center.\nToday, the  NIH is announcing an investment of $55 million to build the foundational partnerships and infrastructure of the PMI Cohort Program, to launch the largest ever study of its kind. This investment will support several Healthcare Provider Organizations (HPOs), a Data and Research Support Center, and a Participant Technologies Center.\nThe HPOs will include regional and national medical centers, community health centers, and VA health centers to ensure that participants in the research reflect the geographic, ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity of the country. These organizations will help build the research protocols and plans, inform their patients about the study, enroll interested individuals, and collect essential health data and biological specimens.\n• Regional medical centers: NIH has selected four regional medical healthcare as the initial partners, bringing research expertise and the ability to reach large numbers of potential volunteers, contributing to the overall diversity of the participants and regions reached by this phase of the program. These centers are:\no Columbia University Health Sciences, New York City, partnering with Weill Medical College of Cornell University and Harlem Hospital\no Northwestern University, Chicago, partnering with University of Chicago, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Alliance of Chicago Community Health Services, LLC, and University of Illinois at Chicago.\no University of Arizona, Tucson, partnering with Banner Health\no University of Pittsburgh\n• Community Health Centers: NIH is initially partnering with six Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), critical healthcare providers for the country's most vulnerable patients, in order to ensure that underserved communities are represented in biomedical research. The initial sites are:\no Cherokee Health Systems, Knoxville, Tennessee\no Community Health Center, Inc., Middletown, Connecticut\no Eau Claire Cooperative Health Center, Columbia, South Carolina\no HRHCare, Peekskill, New York\no Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, Jackson, Mississippi\no San Ysidro Health Center, San Ysidro, California\n• Partnership with the VA: Five years ago, the Department of Veterans Affairs launched the Million Veteran Program to allow researchers to study health issues critical to veterans. To date, more than 490,000 individuals across the country have stepped forward to serve their country once again by donating their data to science. Building off this success, today the VA is also partnering with the NIH to help enroll participants directly into the PMI Cohort Program and to share strategies, protocols, and best practices.\nSteps to Support Data, Tools, and Technology for Researchers and Participants in the PMI Cohort\nJust as important as ensuring the recruitment of a diverse and robust group of individuals to participate in PMI is the need to develop the tools and technology needed to make the data secure and useful to researchers and participants, and to maintain participant  privacy.\n• Developing a Data and Research Support Center: To ensure that the data collected through the PMI Cohort Program is accessible to researchers and research participants as part of a secure system, NIH is funding an award to Vanderbilt University, partnering with Verily (formerly Google Health) and the Broad Institute (with additional collaborations with Columbia University, Northwestern, University of Michigan, and University of Texas at Houston), to create the data infrastructure of the PMI Cohort Program. This infrastructure will allow participants to contribute their clinical and lifestyle information in a secure environment, and receive individual and aggregated study results in return. It will also provide qualified researchers secure access to the data, and ensure that privacy and security are built into the program from day one.\n• Creating Tools and Technologies to Support Enrollment through a Participant Technologies Center: NIH is also funding The Scripps Research Institute and Vibrent Health, in partnership with Sage Bionetworks, PatientsLikeMe, Walgreens, and other partners, to support the development of tools and technologies to enroll people directly into the study. These tools will enable individuals across the country and from all walks of life to participate in the study and contribute both survey information and a range of digital health data over time. These organizations will also explore the most dynamic and useful ways of sharing health and research information with participants.\nSteps to Modernize the Regulatory Approach to Genomic Tests\nIn addition to building the infrastructure to support research through PMI, the Administration is also working to accelerate innovation around genomic tests. As part of PMI,  FDA is developing a flexible yet accountable approach to oversight of genomic technologies. It also has launched a novel platform—precisionFDA—that provides the community with a place to compare the accuracy of their DNA sequencing tests. Today as part of these efforts, FDA is publishing draft guidance that, when finalized, will provide a flexible and streamlined approach to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of these tests.\n• Bringing Accurate Genomic Tests to Market: As precision medicine becomes a reality, patients and their providers need to rely on accurate diagnostics to help them make the best care decisions. To assure patient safety while recognizing rapid advances in science and technology, FDA is proposing a streamlined regulatory approach that developers can opt into that aims to speed the development and scalability of genomic tests. Today, the FDA is releasing  draft guidance on standards for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based in vitro diagnostics used for diagnosing germline diseases as well as draft guidance for the use of genetic databases to support clinical validity for NGS-based in vitro diagnostics. These new policies will make it easier for developers to market safe and effective genomic tests by relying on community-based standards and well-established sources of scientific evidence that meet appropriate standards. FDA will seek comment on this proposed approach for 90 days.", "timestamp": "2016-07-06", "title": "Fact Sheet: Administration Announces New Actions to Advance the President's Precision Medicine Initiative"}

Over the years—and thanks to heroic efforts by our military, our intelligence community, our diplomats, and our development professionals—we pushed Al Qaida out of its camps, helped the Afghan people topple the Taliban and helped them establish a democratic government. We dealt crippling blows to the Al Qaida leadership. We delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. And we trained Afghan forces to take responsibility for their own security.\nAnd given that progress, a year and a half ago, in December 2014, America's combat mission in Afghanistan came to a responsible end. Compared to the 100,000 troops we once had there, today, fewer than 10,000 remain. And compared to their previous mission—helping to lead the fight—our forces are now focused on two narrow missions: training and advising Afghan forces and supporting counterterrorist operations against the remnants of Al Qaida as well as other terrorist groups, including ISIL. In short, even as we've maintained a relentless case against those who are threatening us, we are no longer engaged in a major ground war in Afghanistan.\nBut even these narrow missions continue to be dangerous. Over the past year and a half, 38 Americans—military and civilian—have lost their lives in Afghanistan on behalf of our security. And we honor their sacrifice. We stand with their families in their grief and in their pride. And we resolve to carry on the mission for which they gave their last full measure of devotion.\nThis is also not America's mission alone. In Afghanistan, we're joined by 41 allies and partners, a coalition that contributes more than 6,000 troops of their own. We have a partner in the Afghan Government and the Afghan people, who support a long-term strategic partnership with the United States. And in fact, Afghans continue to step up. For the second year now, Afghan forces are fully responsible for their own security. Every day, nearly 320,000 Afghan soldiers and police are serving and fighting, and many are giving their lives to defend their country.\nTo their credit—and in the face of a continued Taliban insurgency and terrorist networks—Afghan forces remain in control of all the major population centers, provincial capitals, major transit routes and most district centers. Afghan forces have beaten back attacks, and they've pushed the Taliban out of some areas. And meanwhile, in another milestone, we recently removed the leader of the Taliban, Akhtar Mohammad Mansur.\nNevertheless, the security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious. Even as they improve, Afghan security forces are still not as strong as they need to be. With our help, they're still working to improve critical capabilities such as intelligence, logistics, aviation, and command and control. At the same time, the Taliban remains a threat. They have gained ground in some cases. They've continued attacks and suicide bombings, including in Kabul. Because the Taliban deliberately target innocent civilians, more Afghan men, women, and children are dying. And often overlooked in the global refugee crisis, millions of Afghans have fled their homes and many have been fleeing their country.\nNow, as President and Commander in Chief, I've made it clear that I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as safe haven for terrorists to attack our Nation again. That's why I constantly review our strategy with my national security team, including our commanders in Afghanistan. In all these reviews, we're guided by the facts—what's happening on the ground—to determine what's working and what needs to be changed. And that's why, at times, I've made adjustments, for example, by slowing the drawdown of our forces and, more recently, by giving U.S. forces more flexibility to support Afghan forces on the ground and in the air. And I strongly believe that it is in our national security interest—especially after all the blood and treasure we've invested in Afghanistan over the years—that we give our Afghan partners the very best opportunity to succeed.\nUpon taking command of coalition forces this spring, General Nicholson conducted a review of the security situation in Afghanistan and our military posture. It was good to get a fresh set of eyes. And based on the recommendation of General Nicholson, as well as Secretary Carter and Chairman Dunford, and following extensive consultations with my national security team, as well as Congress and the Afghan Government and our international partners, I'm announcing an additional adjustment to our posture.\nInstead of going down to 5,500 troops by the end of this year, the United States will maintain approximately 8,400 troops in Afghanistan into next year, through the end of my administration. The narrow missions assigned to our forces will not change. They remain focused on supporting Afghan forces and going after terrorists. But maintaining our forces at this specific level, based on our assessment of the security conditions and the strength of Afghan forces, will allow us to continue to provide tailored support to help Afghan forces continue to improve. From coalition bases in Jalalabad and Kandahar, we'll be able to continue supporting Afghan forces on the ground and in the air. And we continue supporting critical counterterrorism operations.\nNow, in reaffirming the enduring commitment of the United States to Afghanistan and its people, the decision I'm making today can help our allies and partners align their own commitments. As you know, tomorrow I depart for the NATO summit in Warsaw, where I'll meet with our coalition partners and Afghan President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah. Many of our allies and partners have already stepped forward with commitments of troops and funding so that we can keep strengthening Afghan forces through the end of this decade. The NATO summit will be an opportunity for more allies and partners to affirm their contributions, and I'm confident they will, because all of us have a vital interest in the security and stability of Afghanistan.\nMy decision today also sends a message to the Taliban and all those who have opposed Afghanistan's progress. You have now been waging war against the Afghan people for many years. You've been unable to prevail. Afghan security forces continue to grow stronger. And the commitment of the international community, including the United States, to Afghanistan and its people will endure. I will say it again: The only way to end this conflict and to achieve a full drawdown of foreign forces from Afghanistan is through a lasting political settlement between the Afghan Government and the Taliban. That's the only way. And that is why the United States will continue to strongly support an Afghan-led reconciliation process and why we call on all countries in the region to end safe havens for militants and terrorists. Finally, today's decision best positions my successor to make future decisions about our presence in Afghanistan. In January, the next U.S. President will assume the most solemn responsibility of the Commander in Chief: the security of the United States and the safety of the American people. The decision I'm making today ensures that my successor has a solid foundation for continued progress in Afghanistan as well as the flexibility to address the threat of terrorism as it evolves.\nSo, in closing, I want to address directly what I know is on the minds of many Americans, especially our troops and their families who have borne a heavy burden for our security. When we first sent our forces into Afghanistan 14 years ago, few Americans imagined we'd be there—in any capacity—this long. As President, I focused our strategy on training and building up Afghan forces. It has been continually my belief that it is up to Afghans to defend their country. Because we have emphasized training their capabilities, we've been able to end our major ground war there and bring 90 percent of our troops back home.\nBut even as we work for peace, we have to deal with the realities of the world as it is. And we can't forget what's at stake in Afghanistan. This is where Al Qaida is trying to regroup. This is where ISIL continues to try to expand its presence. If these terrorists succeed in regaining areas and camps where they can train and plot, they will attempt more attacks against us. And we cannot allow that to happen. I will not allow that to happen.\nThis September will mark 15 years since the attacks of 9/11. And once more, we'll pause to remember the lives we lost, Americans and peoples from around the world. We'll stand with their families, who still grieve. We'll stand with survivors, who still bear the scars of that day. We'll thank the first responders who rushed to save others. And perhaps most importantly, we'll salute our men and women in uniform—our 9/11 generation—who have served in Afghanistan and beyond for our security. We'll honor the memory of all those who've made the ultimate sacrifice, including more than 2,200 American patriots who have given their lives in Afghanistan. As we do, let's never forget the progress their service has made possible.\nAfghanistan is not a perfect place. It remains one of the poorest countries in the world. It is going to continue to take time for them to build up military capacity that we sometimes take for granted. And given the enormous challenges they face, the Afghan people will need the partnership of the world, led by the United States, for many years to come. But with our support, Afghanistan is a better place than it once was. Millions of Afghan children—boys and girls—are in school. Dramatic improvements in public health have saved the lives of mothers and children. Afghans have cast their ballots in democratic elections and seen the first democratic transfer of power in their country's history. The current National Unity Government continues to pursue reforms—including record revenues last year—to strengthen their country and, over time, help decrease the need for international support.\nThat Government is a strong partner with us in combating terrorism. That's the progress we've helped make possible. That's the progress that our troops have helped make possible, and our diplomats and our development personnel. That's the progress we can help sustain, in partnership with the Afghan people and our coalition partners. And so I firmly believe the decision I'm announcing today is the right thing to do: for Afghanistan, for the United States, and for the world.\nMay God bless our troops and all who serve to protect us. May God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-07-06", "title": "Remarks on United States Military Strategy in Afghanistan"}

For Muslim Americans, Eid is an opportunity to reflect on the 30 days spent fasting and to recommit to values of gratitude, compassion, and generosity. In neighborhoods and homes across the world, this special occasion begins in the early hours of the day when families dress in their finest attire in preparation for prayers and festivities. Homes are decorated with ornaments and lanterns. Gifts are wrapped and envelopes of money are prepared for kids. Above all, Eid is a time to gather and celebrate with loved ones.\nMuslim Americans are as diverse as our Nation itself: Black, White, Latino, Asian, and Arab. Eid celebrations around the country remind us of our proud history as a nation built by people of all backgrounds, our history of religious freedom and civil liberties, and our history of innovation and strength. These legacies would not be possible without the contributions of Muslim Americans that make our country even stronger.\nThis past month, our country and the world endured challenges and senseless violence that broke our hearts and tried our souls. Our prayers are with the hundreds of innocent lives—many of them Muslim—taken during the month of Ramadan in places like Orlando, Istanbul, Dhaka, Baghdad, and Medina.\nHere at home, we've also seen a rise in attacks against Muslim Americans. No one should ever feel afraid or unsafe in their place of worship. Many Americans have shared in the experience of Ramadan by volunteering in community service efforts to assist those in need and even fasting a few days with their fellow Muslim American coworkers. In the face of hate, it's our American values and strength that bring us together to stand in solidarity and protect one another, thereby, making our Nation stronger and safer.\nMuslim Americans have been part of our American family since its founding. This Eid, we recommit to protecting Muslim Americans against bigotry and xenophobia, while celebrating the contributions of Muslim Americans around the country, including one of our finest, the People's Champion, Muhammad Ali, to whom we bade farewell this Ramadan. Later this month, Michelle and I will host an Eid celebration at the White House, and we look forward to welcoming Americans from around the country to celebrate the holiday.

Dayton of Minnesota.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117880", "text": "Good evening, everybody. I know we've been on a long flight, but given the extraordinary interest in the shootings that took place in Louisiana and Minnesota, I thought it would be important for me to address all of you directly. And I want to begin by expressing my condolences for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.\nAs I said in the statement that I posted on Facebook, we have seen tragedies like this too many times. The Justice Department, I know, has opened a civil rights investigation in Baton Rouge. The Governor of Minnesota, I understand, is calling for an investigation there as well. As is my practice, given my institutional role, I can't comment on the specific facts of these cases, and I have full confidence in the Justice Department's ability to conduct a thorough and fair inquiry.\nBut what I can say is that all of us as Americans should be troubled by these shootings, because these are not isolated incidents. They're symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system. And I just want to give people a few statistics to try to put in context why emotions are so raw around these issues.\nAccording to various studies—not just one, but a wide range of studies that have been carried out over a number of years—African Americans are 30 percent more likely than Whites to be pulled over. After being pulled over, African Americans and Hispanics are three times more likely to be searched. Last year, African Americans were shot by police at more than twice the rate of Whites. African Americans are arrested at twice the rate of Whites. African American defendants are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimums. They receive sentences that are almost 10 percent longer than comparable Whites arrested for the same crime. So that if you add it all up, the African American and Hispanic population, who make up only 30 percent of the general population, make up more than half of the incarcerated population.\nNow, these are facts. And when incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same. And that hurts. And that should trouble all of us. This is not just a Black issue. It's not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about. All fairminded people should be concerned.\nNow, let me just say, we have extraordinary appreciation and respect for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day. They've got a dangerous job. It is a tough job. And as I've said before, they have a right to go home to their families, just like anybody else on the job. And there are going to be circumstances in which they've got to make split-second decisions. We understand that.\nBut when we see data that indicates disparities in how African Americans and Latinos may be treated in various jurisdictions around the country, then it's incumbent on all of us to say, we can do better than this, we are better than this, and to not have it degenerate into the usual political scrum. We should be able to step back, reflect, and ask ourselves, what can we do better so that everybody feels as if they're equal under the law? Now, the good news is, is that there are practices we can institute that will make a difference. Last year, we put together a Task Force that was comprised of civil rights activists and community leaders, but also law enforcement officials: police captains, sheriffs. And they sat around a table, and they looked at the data, and they looked at best practices, and they came up with specific recommendations and steps that could ensure that the trust between communities and police departments were rebuilt and incidents like this would be less likely to occur.\nAnd there are some jurisdictions out there that have adopted these recommendations. But there are a whole bunch that have not. And if anything good comes out of these tragedies, my hope is, is that communities around the country take a look and say, how can we implement these recommendations, and that the overwhelming majority of police officers who are doing a great job every single day and are doing their job without regard to race, that they encourage their leadership and organizations that represent them to get behind these recommendations.\nBecause ultimately, if you can rebuild trust between communities and the police departments that serve them, that helps us solve crime problems. That will make life easier for police officers. They will have more cooperation. They will be safer. They will be more likely to come home. So it would be good for crime fighting, and it will avert tragedy.\nAnd I'm encouraged by the fact that the majority of leadership in police departments around the country recognize this. But change has been too slow, and we have to have a greater sense of urgency about this.\nI'm also encouraged, by the way, that we have bipartisan support for criminal justice reform working its way through Congress. It has stalled and lost some momentum over the last couple of months, in part because Congress is having difficulty, generally, moving legislation forward, and we're in a political season. But there are people of good will on the Republican side and the Democratic side who I've seen want to try to get something done here. That, too, would help provide greater assurance across the country that those in power, those in authority, are taking these issues seriously. So this should be a spur to action to get that done, to get that across the finish line. Because I know there are a lot of people who want to get it done.\nNow, let me just make a couple of final comments. I mentioned in my Facebook statement that I hope we don't fall into the typical patterns that occur after these kinds of incidents occur, where right away, there's a lot of political rhetoric, and it starts dividing people instead of bringing folks together. To be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement. There are times when these incidents occur and you see protests and you see vigils. And I get letters—well-meaning letters sometimes—from law enforcement saying, how come we're under attack? How come not as much emphasis is made when police officers are shot?\nAnd so, to all of law enforcement, I want to be very clear: We know you have a tough job. We mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives. On a regular basis, I have joined with families in front of Capitol Hill to commemorate the incredible heroism that they've displayed. I've hugged family members who've lost loved ones doing the right thing. I know how much it hurts. On a regular basis, we bring in those who've done heroic work in law enforcement and have survived. Sometimes, they've been injured. Sometimes, they've risked their lives in remarkable ways. And we applaud them and appreciate them, because they're doing a really tough job really well. There is no contradiction between us supporting law enforcement—making sure they've got the equipment they need, making sure that their collective bargaining rights are recognized, making sure that they're adequately staffed, making sure that they are respected, making sure their families are supported—and also saying that there are problems across our criminal justice system; there are biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out. That's not an attack on law enforcement, that is reflective of the values that the vast majority of law enforcement bring to the job.\nBut I repeat: If communities are mistrustful of the police, that makes those law enforcement officers who are doing a great job and are doing the right thing, it makes their lives harder. So when people say, \"Black Lives Matter,\" that doesn't mean blue lives don't matter, it just means all lives matter, but right now the big concern is the fact that the data shows Black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents.\nThis isn't a matter of us comparing the value of lives, this is recognizing that there is a particular burden that is being placed on a group of our fellow citizens. And we should care about that. And we can't dismiss it. We can't dismiss it.\nSo let me just end by saying, I actually, genuinely, truly believe that the vast majority of American people see this as a problem that we should all care about. And I would just ask those who question the sincerity or the legitimacy of protests and vigils and expressions of outrage, who somehow label those expressions of outrage as, quote, unquote, \"political correctness,\" I'd just ask folks to step back and think, what if this happened to somebody in your family? How would you feel?\nTo be concerned about these issues is not political correctness, it's just being American and wanting to live up to our best and highest ideals. And it's to recognize the reality that we've got some tough history and we haven't gotten through all of that history yet. And we don't expect that in my lifetime, maybe not in my children's lifetime, that all the vestiges of that past will have been cured, will have been solved, but we can do better. People of good will can do better.\nAnd doing better involves not just addressing potential bias in the criminal justice system. It's recognizing that too often we're asking police to man the barricades in communities that have been forgotten by all of us for way too long, in terms of substandard schools and inadequate jobs and a lack of opportunity.\nWe've got to tackle those things. We can do better. And I believe we will do better.\nAll right.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117836", "text": "Westin Hotel\nWarsaw, Poland\n7:54 P.M. CEST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Good evening. Obviously there's a lot of news today for us to cover. But we're going to start with the news of the President's trip to Warsaw and some of the activities that he's been engaged in here with our NATO allies.\nI'm joined by the President's Deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes. And to his right is the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Affairs Slotkin. And so both of them can provide you some additional insight about the meetings that the President has done today. Then what we'll do is we'll open it up to questions for Elissa -- any questions you may have for her about the President's activities here at the NATO Summit. Then we'll let her go, and I can take questions -- Ben and I can take questions on other things that may be on your mind, including some of the significant news back home. But we'll reserve that to the end, and give you a chance to hear from Ben and Elissa first.\nSo, Ben, do you want to take it from here?\nMR. RHODES: So I'll just start briefly with a little bit more detail on a couple of the President's meetings today.\nFirst of all, he had an important opportunity to meet with the leaders of the EU -- Presidents Tusk and Juncker. They, as the President said in his remarks, discussed the aftermath of the British referendum and discussed the need for an orderly and constructive process between the EU and the United Kingdom with respect to how they formulate their future relationship. They also discussed a range of other issues on which we're cooperating closely, including the situation with respect to refugees here in Europe, also looking ahead to the summit that the President will be hosting at the U.N. General Assembly on refugees in September.\nThey discussed the steps we've taken to enhance our counter-terrorism cooperation, given the threats that we're facing from ISIL. And we've made good progress in addressing gaps in information-sharing and ways that we can work more closely together in our intelligence and law enforcement communities.\nThey discussed the situation with respect to Russia, and in particular, focused on the situation in Ukraine. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining the sanctions that are on Russia so long as there continues to be infringement on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and also affirmed their support for the Minsk process and the need for Russia to follow through on its commitments, as well as all the parties involved.\nThey, again, addressed T-TIP and committed themselves to making progress in finalizing the key issues over the course of the next several months. They reviewed the progress in implementing the Iran nuclear deal. The EU, of course, played a critical role in achieving the Iran nuclear deal.\nAnd then, lastly, they had a broad conversation about the need for all of us in the United States and Europe and the transatlantic community to affirm the importance of our shared values, at a time of much turmoil and challenges to globalization, they underscored, as they did in their public remarks, the need to lift up the values of democracy, pluralism, inclusivity, and the success of the European Project, which has delivered such an enormous benefit to the people of this continent in preserving peace, security, and delivering very high standards of living.\nThen, briefly, the President met with President Ghani and CEO Abdullah of Afghanistan before the NATO Summit. The Afghans expressed great appreciation for the President's recent announcement to maintain a force of roughly 8,400 troops through the end of 2016. They discussed how that continued commitment from the United States, coupled with the commitment from NATO allies, would ensure that we are doing what we can to support the Afghan security forces and the strategic plan that the Afghans have put in place to better secure their country and continue the fight against the Taliban, just as we'll be continuing the fight against extremist groups in Afghanistan.\nThey discussed the need for a continued focus on the unity government and the need to have all of the different parties inside of Afghanistan work together on behalf of a stable future. And they also discussed their commitment to remaining open to an Afghan-led reconciliation process, which could potentially, if the Taliban shifts course, bring greater peace and stability to Afghanistan.\nSo it was a very constructive conversation with the Afghans, and very timely in the aftermath of the President's announcement the other day and in advance of the session tomorrow morning, which will focus on Afghanistan.\nElissa can read out the first session of the NAC.\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: Thanks, Ben. Hi, everyone. All 28 heads of state/heads of government met this afternoon for three hours in our first NAC session. Montenegro was also there since they received a formal invite to join NATO.\nI think the session really focused on two major themes. The first one is affirming the transition from reassurance to deterrence. And I think in order to understand that and contextualize it, it's useful to just review the bidding and go back to where we were two years ago, the Wales summit, and what we were talking about then. At the time, Russia had just attempted to annex Crimea. They were pursuing aggressive activities in eastern Ukraine. And the summit, which had been previously scheduled to talk about Afghanistan and talk about partnership, now focused on the importance of our Article 5 commitments, on showing a strong message to the world of living up to those commitments and deterring threats.\nThe heads of state met and reacted swiftly, and came up with a number of concepts -- the Readiness Action Plan is the bucket of things that they came up with. But they were just concepts.\nTwo years later, we have fulfilled those concepts and made them real. And I think a number of things that heads of state talked about today in the session really affirmed that we've lived up to those commitments -- the Very High Readiness Task Force, putting NATO forces further out in the Baltic States and on the eastern flank of NATO, a number of things that we've done to speed up decision-making at NATO.\nOn top of that, you have the announcement that the President made earlier today, and the Secretary General is talking about now, which is the enhanced forward presence, putting four battalions in three Baltic States and in Poland, with the United States going to Poland. Four battalions -- that represents the largest movement of NATO personnel since the end of the Cold War. So in combination with fulfilling the Readiness Action Plan, it really sort of signaled, and leaders talked about the important of showing the world that we have really provided this strong deterrent message.\nThat is on top of what the United States has done bilaterally. So if you think about it in two buckets -- NATO has done a number of things; the United States did a number of things. I think you've seen particularly that we surged forces into the Baltic States, in particular, these companies. We quadrupled -- the President quadrupled our ERI monies that go to training and exercises. We announced a third Armored Brigade Combat Team back in March. It's hard to follow all the details, but I think the important piece here is that, by the end of next year, the United States will have a division's worth of personnel and equipment on the continent of Europe, on top of what NATO has done. So the two, in combination, I think send a very strong message.\nOf course, the message of deterrence is one side of the coin. The other side is dialogue. And I think the President and a number of other leaders noted the importance of keeping the dialogue open, particularly with Russia -- that you need to come to the table with a strong, deterrent message in order to have a fruitful dialogue, but that the door remains very open, we remain in contact and in strong dialogue with the Russians on a number of issues. So that was theme number one.\nTheme number two I would really say was NATO unity. And we talk about NATO unity a lot every time there's a summit or a foreign or defense ministerial. But I think it was a particularly poignant message today, a few weeks after Brexit, and particularly because it's both President Obama's and Prime Minister Cameron's final summit. And so they spoke very early on in the session and really set the tone.\nThe President spoke eloquently about the importance of European unity, and that despite the forces of disintegration that we know are out there, NATO remains an extremely strong pillar of our own security; the Euro-Atlantic Alliance is extremely strong; and that it's not just about military forces, that NATO and the stability that is preserved -- is about preserving our values, it's about pushing specific democratic ideals in the world, and that we shouldn't be timid about representing and pushing for those things, despite forces of disintegration. So he spoke eloquently about that.\nPrime Minister Cameron -- very similarly passed that message on, and, particularly from his seat, made that strong point.\nSo those two themes were really what we discussed today. I'm happy to get into more when we go into questions.\nMR. EARNEST: Elissa, don't go too far. Are there questions for Elissa?\nJustin.\nQ: Can you talk maybe a little more about President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron's interactions -- how they talked together, whether they kind of discussed Brexit amongst themselves, in addition to the broader plenary?\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: So I can't speak to any details of their conversations. I was sitting in the cheap seats, so I don't know the content of their personal dialogue up at the table.\nMR. EARNEST: So I will just say -- well, the thing that I was able to see from the cheap seats is that prior to the formal beginning of the conference, the two leaders did have an opportunity to visit for several minutes before the actual meeting started. Again, I don't have details of their private conversation to read out, but they did have an opportunity, even as they were sitting next to each other, to have a conversation today.\nRon.\nQ: What is NATO's response specifically to ISIS and the carnage that's happened over the past few weeks? Are there specific steps, announcements that are going to be made that are different than the (inaudible) strategy in any way? Or is the feeling that intensifying the strategy that's been in place is sufficient despite what appears to be a significant amount -- a significant increase in the level of violence?\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: So that's a significant focus of conversation tomorrow at some of the NAC sessions scheduled for tomorrow. I think you do see NATO performing a training mission, and there's talk of enhancing that mission. There's a series of military requirements that we have as part of the counter-ISIL coalition writ large, And the United States is very supportive of NATO playing a role and filling some of those requirements. But it's an active topic of conversation right now, and I don't want to get ahead of what might be decided tomorrow.\nMR. RHODES: Just to put a finer point on it -- you have essentially two streams. There are a number of NATO member states who are part of the coalition who are engaged in airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria, and then NATO as an alliance has certain missions and tasks that they're fulfilling, such as some of the training that we're doing for Iraqi security forces, for instance. And we'll be discussing tomorrow what can be done as an alliance, in addition to what the individual member states are doing.\nIt will also be an opportunity for leaders to discuss issues on the sidelines, given some of the critical coalition members who are here -- the United Kingdom, France, Turkey, and others.\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle.\nQ: For either of you: What do you expect Russia's response to these NATO moves to be? And you mentioned some of this posture of being leveraged when it comes to dialogue, but they've really shown no movement since they took over Crimea two years ago.\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: So I'll leave the Russian response to them. I think what's important and interesting -- again, if you review the bidding and go back to Wales, we were prepared for a very different type of summit thaN we had two years ago. And that all changed when Russia attempted to annex Crimea. So the conversations that we're having today about deterrence and putting more NATO forces or more U.S. forces forward into the eastern flank of NATO are a direct response to some of the activities that Russia has chosen to embark upon.\nI do think we have dialogue on a number of issues with the Russians, and I do think it's important that they see us responding in particular to our Article 5 commitments to defend the nations on the eastern flank.\nSo I won't suppose what their response is going to be, but I think any response that we're somehow provoking them I think can be pushed back upon, based on how we got to this place in the first place.\nMR. RHODES: I'd just say also, first of all, Russia has in the past expressed concern and complained about steps that we're taking in this area. But I think what we're demonstrating is, if Russia continues this pattern of aggressive behavior, there will be a response and there will be a greater presence in Eastern Europe. So essentially, we will not be in any way deterred from fulfilling our commitments by anything that Russia says or does. We are going to do what is necessary to defend the Alliance and to defend the Eastern members of our Alliance.\nThe second thing I'd say is that, in the long run, we are very confident in the strength of NATO, in our capabilities, in our economies. And Russia is incurring a significant cost for its own actions. Their economy continues to be in very difficult circumstances. They are isolated politically because of what they're doing in Ukraine. They continue to be under sanctions. So in the long run, that cost-benefit analysis has to sink in that, unless Russia shifts course, there is going to be the response that you're seeing through sanctions, the response that you're seeing through these deployments. And there's going to be solidarity among NATO, and we're not going to allow Russia in any way to undermine that solidarity.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: I imagine that during that phone conversation that the President had with Vladimir Putin the other day, some of this was foreshadowed, discussed during that conversation. Do you expect this movement, this effort to send a message to Putin to give it other efforts to get the Russians to rein in their client in Syria? I mean, the U.S. has been emphasizing how they can work together in some ways on the diplomatic front.\nAnd then, secondly, can you flesh out a little bit about what you were talking about there, Ben, in terms of refugees? There's been some speculation that, for lack of a better term, that refugee movement is weaponizing refugees. Is there the idea or perception here that those refugee flows are intentionally meant to destabilize Europe?\nMR. RHODES: So, on your first question, they actually didn't really discuss these issues. There were three topics of discussion: the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, the situation in Syria, and Ukraine.\nI think Russia has been fully aware that we're planning to undertake the types of steps that we announced today. They've expressed their opposition to those steps. I think the important point to make here is that we have always made very clear that we are not going to draw linkages. In other words, we're not going to say that we're going to scale back our commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine or our actions in Europe in exchange for some degree of Russian cooperation in Syria. We're dealing with these issues in isolation.\nAnd again, if we could have constructive Russian cooperation on these issues, that would be preferable. And so much of their conversation focused on whether or not we can arrive at some understanding in Syria to reinforce the Cessation of Hostilities, to focus on ISIL and al Nusra and not the moderate elements of the opposition, and to get back onto a political process that leads to a new government in Syria. We remain very open to that type of cooperation. But, again, we're not drawing linkages between these different issues.\nOn the issue of refugees, it didn't come up in that particular context. I will say a couple things. First of all, NATO has been working -- in addition to the political agreement that the EU reached with Turkey, NATO has also been working in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean to help address the refugee flows and to help provide greater security along NATO's southern flank. At the same time, we are working with our European allies as they deal with these inflows of refugees in part by demonstrating that we're going to lead on this as well. And that's why the President is hosting this summit at the U.N. General Assembly in addition to taking our own complement of refugees.\nI do think that one of the things that comes up in conversations in addition to the refugee issue is that there have been some efforts from Russia to essentially try to sow some discord or dissension within Europe. They have a very loud megaphone in this part of the world, and you see efforts that seek to pull apart the threads of European and transatlantic unity and there is some concern about that. And I think that in part fuels the types of statements you saw from President Obama and President Tusk today in reaffirming the importance of transatlantic unity and European solidarity, pushing back against the forces of disintegration -- whether those come from globalization and some of the backlash against globalization, whether that comes from Russia and some of the things that they say and do to try to create a sense of disunity, or whether that comes from security threats like terrorism.\nQ: Picking up I think, Ben, on what you just said, I'm wondering why the President has confidence that the Europeans will remain united in preserving sanctions. I mean, just in the last few weeks here, the Prime Minister of Italy going to the St. Petersburg forum, something European leaders have been shunning. You had President Hollande of France saying we need to engage with the Russians. You had the German foreign minister referring to a military exercise in Poland as \"saber-rattling.\" And so I'm wondering what accounts for the optimism or confidence that Europe won't splinter in its approach to Russia, particularly as domestic politics begin to enter the equation in places like Germany?\nMR. RHODES: So, first of all, we had a very strong message from the EU leadership that they remain committed to rolling over sanctions as Russia is not fulfilling its commitments under Minsk.\nSecond, I think in the President's own conversations with European leaders, they've reaffirmed that commitment. Tomorrow they'll be meeting as a Quint -- the United States, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy -- with President Poroshenko of Ukraine to expressly send a message of support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. I think that meeting itself will demonstrate the united front here between the United States and Europe on the issue.\nLook, it has been the case throughout the sanctions regime that it is difficult for some countries. Some countries are incurring more strains because of the enforcement of sanctions. So that is not a new dynamic. It's something that we've managed over the course of the last couple of years.\nThe point we've made repeatedly is our preference is to not have to maintain sanctions. But in order to see a relaxation of those sanctions, Russia has to follow through on its own commitments. And we have a framework under Minsk, and we can measure what Russia is doing in terms of support they're providing for separatists in eastern Ukraine, in terms of fulfilling the commitments around the political framework that Minsk envisions.\nAnd so we can say very clearly to our European allies that we share their interest in having more constructive relations with Russia, but the pathway to that future has to be Russia respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. And the risk of not taking that stand is European security and an international order that shows that there are consequences for that type of behavior. And at the end of the day, given all the different forces of disintegration that we see in parts of the world, it's even more important that that solidarity sustains itself.\nQ: Maybe I missed it -- did you say -- did the President tell President Putin that these announcements were coming?\nMR. RHODES: No, they did not -- again, they didn't discuss these issues. They discussed Ukraine. That was the issue that they discussed related to Europe.\nQ: Can you say where the U.S. troops will be located in Poland, and when that's going to start?\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: So there's two separate announcements that the President made today -- one, on the U.S. contribution to the NATO enhanced forward presence. That battalion will be in Poland. The location, the actual specific locations -- it's between a couple of different places. We will need to finalize that with the Polish government, so it's to be determined.\nSame thing with the headquarters of our Armored Brigade Combat team. It's also between a couple of different places; those details are being worked right now with the Poles.\nQ: And do you have timing?\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: A timeline? So I believe that the battalion that -- under the NATO hat for the enhanced forward presence will be there by mid-2017, so before summer of next year. And the headquarters of our brigade combat team I think in 2017, potentially early in 2017, but I don't have the exact date for you.\nQ: You talk a lot about the discussion -- about the situation that's ongoing in Ukraine. However how much discussion was there regarding the continued buildup of military hardware on the (inaudible) border, which is obviously bordering with Poland? And this is one of the reasons why the regional NATO partners have lobbied so hard for NATO support here.\nACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY SLOTKIN: The focus of our meeting today was really about what we as NATO are going to be doing, and putting forward the commitments that we followed up on. We didn't get into specifics of other forces outside of NATO. It was really an in-house conversation among the allies.\nQ: Are you able to explain or give us more detail about the meetings with the European Presidents? I'm thinking here Jean-Claude Juncker expressed when he came out of the meeting -- he didn't have a lot of time, but he reiterated that he wasn't in a position to discuss, and Europe isn't in a position to discuss Britain's exit from the European Union until Britain triggers Article 50. Can you give us a little more detail on how that meeting went and a little more content?\nMR. RHODES: On just Brexit, specifically?\nQ: Yes. I mean, his position is a relatively firm position and he was reiterating what he'd said last week.\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, again, I don't want to speak for the EU, but they did discuss the process. What was clear from President Juncker is that it's their view that Article 50 has to be invoked before the negotiation can begin. So, essentially, they're currently preparing for that to take place. And then there was a discussion about how that negotiation should go forward.\nThe President made clear that this is something to be done between the EU and the United Kingdom. We, of course, do encourage them to continue to have a close relationship. The EU leaders expressed their commitment to having a close relationship. Even as President Juncker said -- as he said publicly -- that if you leave the Union you don't have all the benefits of the Union, particularly given the four freedoms that the Union underscores and is founded upon.\nSo, again, they did discuss somewhat what their approach would be towards trying to maintain a close relationship with the UK, even as they recognize that the relationship will change. They discussed the timeline associated with those discussions, the 24 months that are allowed for those discussions to go forward. The President's view as a friend of both the EU and the United Kingdom was that we want it to be an orderly and constructive process, transparent process, so people understand the decisions that are being made, and that we would like to see, on the back end of that process, the EU and the UK maintaining a very close relationship, but also the EU strengthened internally and pushing back against further forces of disunity.\nQ: My point is, did you come out of that meeting as encouraged as you hoped you might have been that there could be a smooth, relatively easy transition, which was clearly the point of that meeting? The economic consequences for the world are stark.\nMR. RHODES: Yeah, I think we did. I think it was clear that people recognize just how important it is that this be done in a way that not upset financial markets, that not upset global economic stability. I think it was clear from the meeting that this is not going to be done in a way that is punitive towards the United Kingdom, but rather is about defining a new relationship.\nSo we were assured that they're taking a very sober, constructive approach to this, that they recognize that the relationship would have to change after Article 50 is invoked, but that they want to proceed in a manner that does address those global economic concerns and that preserves the partnership and relationship between the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, even as the specific relationship between the Union and the UK will change.\nQ: Can I just follow on -- you mentioned the four freedoms, and one thing we heard from the EU leaders was the importance of preserving the freedom of movement for workers if they were to preserve the access to the free market -- or to the European markets. I'm wondering, does the President agree with that kind of specific -- even though the negotiations haven't begun, it seems like they set out the red line right there.\nMR. RHODES: Look, we really don't take specific positions on the substance of the negotiation. I think the EU leaders are just making a simple point that there are certain benefits that accrue to EU members. The relationship with the UK will change in some ways. We will leave it to the EU and the UK to sort that out in terms of the specifics. And again, what he said publicly -- President Junker -- that's the same message he said privately with respect to the four freedoms.\nBut again, it's not our position to get into the negotiating substance, but rather to try to encourage a process that can lead to an end result that is orderly, does not disrupt the global economy, that can maintain both transatlantic solidarity and European unity.\nMR. EARNEST: Anything else for Elissa? Thank you for your time.\nOkay, before we move on to other topics, I know that there is great interest in an update on the President's schedule for the remainder of this trip. I don't have any additional details about any potential changes to the President's schedule. So we will certainly keep you apprised if any changes are made. But at this point, I don't have any changes to announce.\nSo with that out of the way, are there other questions you'd like to discuss?\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you explain to the American people what the 1,000 American troops rotating in and out of Poland really means to them? And as far as Brexit is concerned, the impact on NATO -- is there an actual impact? Or is this something that is, broadly speaking, more semantics than anything else?\nMR. RHODES: So on the second question, there's absolutely no impact on NATO from Brexit. The leaders actually made a point of stressing that. The UK is in NATO. They're a critical member of NATO. They're going to remain a critical member of NATO.\nThe EU, even as they have their foreign and defense policies in certain areas, also stressed to us their continued commitment to NATO. So we don't see any change in the solidarity in the Alliance from Brexit.\nQ: -- stays the same roughly still --\nMR. RHODES: The 2 percent commitment remains an Alliance commitment. And the UK is one of the few countries that has actually already met that commitment. Other countries are moving towards it over the next several years.\nOn your first question, I think for the American people, the important point is that NATO has been a cornerstone of our own security, that having a space for Europe to be at peace with itself, to be prosperous, to be democratic has benefitted us greatly. Europe is our closest partner in the world. Europe is one of the biggest markets for our goods. So European security is fundamental to our own security and prosperity. And having this troop presence in Poland, having this additional NATO presence along the eastern borders and the Baltics, I think reaffirms that we are going to fulfill our Alliance commitments under Article 5 to defend every ally, and that the American people benefit greatly from being able to count on the security of Europe.\nAnd I would also say, in Poland, in particular, we're very proud of what we've done to support the emergency of democracy and the emergency of a more stable and dynamic economy since the end of the Cold War. And so it's also a signal not just of our NATO commitment but of our commitment here to Poland.\nQ: If I could follow, and then just one last one for you, Josh. If I could ask you, Ben, about Finland and Ukraine and perhaps Georgia. Are those all nations that -- among the conversation anyway -- that are still possible signatories to NATO in the near future? And if so, what can the United States do, if anything, to facilitate that?\nMR. RHODES: Well, NATO has an open-door policy. And so we do have an openness to additional members, additional countries joining NATO. Montenegro is joining NATO at the summit, which indicates that NATO continues to grow. In order to join NATO, countries have to meet a very clear criteria in terms of their capabilities, in terms of their public support for joining NATO. And NATO itself has to have a consensus to invite member states in.\nSo while we have an open-door policy, I couldn't tell you today that there is any one country after Montenegro that is ready to become a member of NATO. What I will say on Ukraine is, precisely because of the situation that Ukraine finds itself in, we have a NATO-Ukraine Council. And that will meet tomorrow with President Poroshenko and the Alliance. And part of what we've been able to do through that is have NATO member states provide security assistance to Ukraine to help strengthen their security forces so that they're better able to provide for their own defense in the very difficult circumstances that they find themselves in.\nSo that is the manner in which NATO is expressing its support for Ukraine. It's, of course, not the same as being a member of the Alliance, where there is an Article 5 commitment that if there is any infringement on the territory of a NATO member state we will come to their defense. But it is an expression for our support for Ukraine, our desire to strengthen their security forces, our commitment, frankly, separate from NATO to have sanctions on Russia so long as they're violating Ukrainian sovereignty.\nAnd Ukraine has expressed some interest in NATO, but, again, they would have to meet a set of criteria and the Alliance itself would have to choose to extend that invitation. And that has not yet happened.\nQ: Finland?\nMR. RHODES: Yes. Finland also cooperates closely with NATO and NATO member states in terms of their security policies.\nThe only other thing I'd say is that before coming here, Secretary Kerry visited both Tbilisi, Georgia and Kiev, Ukraine, in part to continue the discussions with them about how those countries are working with NATO. Georgia, for instance, has deployed to Afghanistan in the past and worked with NATO under that umbrella. So Secretary Kerry's visit I think expressed our continued close coordination with those two countries.\nQ: And if I could ask you, Josh, just about the President and his reaction to what's transpired in Dallas? How much did this take out of him, personally? And if you could also answer the question that some are asking, which is whenever he brings up guns or the use of weapons in circumstances like these, some people are concerned that it politicizes a tragedy perhaps too soon while their feelings or the emotions are still very raw. If you could talk about those things.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, you had the opportunity to hear directly from the President early this morning. And he did discuss how the entire country is grieving alongside the people in Dallas.\nThere are five Dallas-area police officers who didn't come home last night. And that's a tragedy. And as the President himself said there is no justification for violence against law enforcement officers. These are men and women who put on a uniform every day prepared to put their lives on the line to protect all of us. That's exactly what happened last night in Dallas. You had a large number of police officers who put on their uniform and were on duty last night to ensure the safety of innocent citizens who were making their voices heard and expressing their concerns about inequities in the criminal justice system. And yet those police officers still fulfilled their responsibility to protect their fellow citizens. That's what makes the loss of those police officers all the more tragic.\nAnd the President had an opportunity to convey his condolences on behalf of the country directly to the Mayor when he spoke to him earlier today. And if there are additional conversations that the President has with officials in Dallas, we'll certainly let you know. I know that White House officials have been in touch with officials in Dallas not just through the night, but also over the course of the day today.\nThe Attorney General spoke earlier today and she discussed how there are a range of federal law enforcement agencies that are offering their support to law enforcement in Dallas. This includes the FBI, the ATF, and the Marshals Service. I know that the Department of Homeland Security has resources that they can lend to this effort.\nSo I think the kind of federal response that you're seeing operationally, as well as the emotional response you're seeing across the country reflects the depth of the tragedy in Dallas that took place last night. And obviously, the President is feeling that, even though we are seven time zones away.\nAs it relates to the gun issue, I think the President was quite direct in his comments today, indicating that our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the families of those who lost loved ones. And there is never a justification for carrying out acts of violence against law enforcement officers. But the President's views about the impact that the easy availability of guns has on our community is a significant source of concern to him. Too many innocent lives have been claimed because of the easy access that people have to guns, in some cases, guns that were never intended to be on city streets.\nSo the President's policy position is clear. But the President was just as clear about the fact that our foremost concern right now is consoling and supporting the families of those police officers who were killed and the broader community in Dallas that is feeling quite acutely the tragedy from last night.\nRon.\nQ: Can you confirm that there -- is there some consideration for the President returning to the United States, breaking off his trip? Is there some consideration of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, at this point, if we have a change in the schedule to announce we'll let you know. Obviously this is an incident that took place only about 18 hours ago, and while the President has been engaged in some critically important work here in Warsaw, interacting with our NATO allies that Ben and Elissa have been describing, the President has been getting regular updates about what's happening back home as well. And one of the challenges of the presidency is the person who is entrusted with the responsibility of leading the country has to be able to focus on and devote significant attention to more than one priority at a time.\nSo I just don't have any changes to the schedule to announce, particularly given that this is something that just transpired in the last 18 hours, but it's something that will follow closely, and if it merits or requires a change in the President's schedule, then we'll certainly let you know.\nQ: What kind of development could merit a change in schedule?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there are more facts and details that need to be learned about the investigation. And obviously this is something that the entire country is reacting to, and something that the federal government is supporting the response to. But, look, if there's a change in the President's schedule, then we'll be sure to let you know.\nQ: Kevin asked about the gun issue. What about the more broad criticism and comments by some of the President's critics who suggest that his support for protesters, his support -- his focusing on what he sees as racial -- racism in the criminal justice system and policing around the country in some way -- I don't want to say encouraged or causes, but creates the conditions whereby attacks on police officers might be carried out. In particular, there's one representative in Texas who said that the spread of disinformation and constant instigation by our leaders, including our President, has contributed to this, what he calls, this modern-day hostility between the communities -- certain communities and the police force.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that in a couple of ways. The first is, the President was quite direct today -- and not for the first time -- that there is never justification for carrying out an act of violence against a law enforcement officer. And the second thing is, the President confronted this question quite directly yesterday upon arrival in Warsaw, before the tragedy in Dallas -- just a couple of hours before the tragedy in Dallas.\nAgain, the President was quite direct in saying that acknowledging the reality of some of the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system and vowing to confront them is not at all an expression of criticism or a lack of support for the vast majority of men and women in law enforcement who do an outstanding job. There are men and women in law enforcement agencies all across the country who put on their uniform every day, prepared to put their life on the line for the community that they've sworn to serve and protect.\nAnd the President said in his State of the Union address not this year, but last year, that those men and women have a right to come home. And the President has, time and again, articulated his strong support for our men and women in uniform, and has been in the position of grieving with the families of those that have been lost.\nSo as it relates to some of the comments that you're referencing, I don't think there's anybody who thinks that that kind of divisive rhetoric is either going to address some of the needed reforms in our criminal justice system or do anything to protect our men and women in uniform.\nQ: The President is confident that he has struck the right balance in this very sensitive issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think people can judge for themselves, but I think that the President confronted this quite directly in the remarks that he delivered last night in Warsaw, just hours before this tragic shooting in Dallas.\nQ: You said that the President did call the Mayor. Has he been -- are there any other specific conversations he has had with people there in Dallas, or in Texas, or in the States*?\nMR. EARNEST: That's the only -- the President did place a call to Mayor Rawlings this morning, Warsaw time -- still the middle of the night back in Dallas. I'm not aware of any additional calls that the President has made. But if he has, then we will let all of you know.\nQ: How did the President find out about this? Was he awakened? Was he -- I think it was about 6:00 a.m. local time or so. Any detail about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that the President did wake up to this news this morning in Warsaw. The President was updated on the situation by his national security team back in Washington.\nQ: Does that mean he was awakened to be told the news?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into the details of how exactly that information was communicated to him, but he woke up to that news early this morning in Warsaw.\nQ: And lastly, the people in America who -- I understand some of the arguments, but just feel that this is a time when the President should be there, hands on. Obviously he's in meetings here, hours on end, on some very sensitive and critical issues. What do you say to them who feel that the President should be more directly hands on, engaged.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would start by acknowledging that the President has spoken to this issue just twice in the less than 18 hours that the President has been in Poland now. So this is obviously something that the President is quite focused on. The President and his team have been interacting with a lot of frequency with officials in Dallas. There are federal resources that are being committed to the investigation and to the recovery effort, both from the FBI and the ATF. There are U.S. Marshals that are involved in that effort as well. I know the Department of Homeland Security also has resources that they're devoting to this effort. White House staff have been in touch with senior officials in Dallas as well to make sure that they have the kind of support that they need from the federal government.\nThe President is getting regular updates on the situation. And I do think this is an apt illustration of how challenging the modern presidency is. We have the expectation that the President of the United States must be someone with the capacity to focus on and be attentive to very high priorities, more than one at the same time. And that's exactly what the President of the United States is doing right now. He didn't get a lot of sleep last night. I don't know how much sleep he's going to get tonight. But this is something that -- this is something that requires intense and round-the-clock attention, and that's exactly what the President has devoted to it.\nMichelle.\nQ: Today, Speaker Ryan said that everyone in Congress, Republican and Democrat, would like to see less gun violence. And he also at the end mentioned that there needs to be action. But we haven't seen any movement at all, at least on guns or preventing certain people from getting guns, in Congress. So what is your take on what he said? Do you buy that?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly take Speaker Ryan at his word. I think that he was conscious of the need to live up to some of the rhetoric that he used in his statement. He noted specifically that it's important for the country not to lose sight of the values that unite us. Speaker Ryan acknowledged in his statement that there are differences, we do have some differences about the best way to achieve these goals that we share.\nBut I think particularly at this time in our country, in the aftermath of a tragedy as terrible as the one that was sustained in Dallas last night, I think Speaker Ryan struck the right tone, and I certainly take him at his word.\nQ: Does the President consider this to be an act of terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is my understanding that investigators have now publicly ruled out the possibility that the individual who carried out this terrible act of violence had any sort of connections to terrorist organizations either in the United States or around the world. So if that's the question that you're asking, I don't think that there's a link to any sort of terrorist conspiracy. I think that investigators have ruled that out.\nQ: No, I mean does the President consider this domestic terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think that there are a lot of questions that are being asked right now about this person's motive and this person's intent. I know that investigators have indicated they're interested in trying to learn more about that. So I would let them conduct their investigation and render their own judgment about this person's motivation, but I don't think that in any way lessens the significance of this event or in any way downplays the significance of this tragedy.\nQ: This was a case of a sniper targeting police. It ended with this robot that was capable of detonating an explosive. And I know part of the White House's stance on looking at community policing is reassessing military-style equipment that they have. But the fact that there are so many high-powered weapons out there, does this indicate that there's a need for police to be better equipped to deal with things like this that can happen virtually any time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's too early to sort of second-guess or to provide a detailed analysis or an after-action report about the response of Dallas law enforcement officials to this incident. I think the President's expectation -- and the President made a reference to this in his statement today, as well -- it is important for us to make sure that law enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies have the tools that they need to do their job. That certainly is an important way for us to show support for their important work. We can make sure that these law enforcement officials have the equipment and training that they need to do their job as safely and as effectively as possible.\nWe can make sure that local law enforcement organizations are getting the financial support that they need from the federal government to maintain appropriate staffing levels. We can make sure that we are fighting for the collective bargaining rights of law enforcement officers all across the country. Those are all important ways that we can demonstrate our support to our men and women in blue, and the President has certainly done that time and time and time again.\nBut at this point, I don't have an after-action assessment other than to say the President certainly does believe that law enforcement agencies should have the firepower necessary to protect the community.\nQ: In Dallas, unusual, perhaps the first time the police have used the tactic of a robot armed with an explosive as a method for employing deadly force. Is there anything you can tell us about what the President makes of that, what he thinks of that tactic? And also, the President campaigning on bringing the country together, including on race, what can you tell us about these thoughts on whether or not he's failed to deliver on that goal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again as it relates to come of the tactics that were employed by law enforcement officials in Dallas to bring an end to this situation, I'll let them speak to that, and I'll let them conduct their own after-action assessment, which I'm sure they will do, to evaluate the effectiveness of some of the tactics that they employed.\nAs it relates to the President and the priority that he's placed on uniting the country -- this is something that the President has talked about on many, many occasions, and I'll try to summarize it, but he certainly has said it many times much more eloquently than I will be able to do from here.\nI would summarize it, though, in the following way. The President, I think most eloquently in his speech at Selma, noted that our country has made remarkable progress over the last several decades in living up to our founding principles, and ensuring that people are treated fairly, regardless of the color of their skin, regardless of what their last name is or where they came from. And to deny that progress is to deny the significant sacrifice that so many Americans of all races made to make that progress.\nSo at the same time, I don't think there's anybody that thinks that that work is done. And that is what makes our country special -- is that we are doggedly, daily seeking to form a more perfect union. And that means -- or that certainly includes living up to the kinds of values that we cherish, and ensuring that individuals are judged by their content of their character, not by the color of their skin, as Dr. King said. And we certainly have much more work to do as a country to realize that vision and to fulfill that promise that our founding fathers first identified.\nQ: Just want to follow up -- Dallas did all the right things -- community policing, police training and de-escalation, and they even supported the peaceful protest yesterday by taking selfies. And those were exactly the kinds of things the President and other Democrats, including black leaders, have pushed for. What remedies does he believe will work?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this goes to the question that Michelle was asking about the potential motive of this individual. So it's hard for me to weigh on that too directly at this point.\nI have read a little bit about the important reforms that Dallas, under the leadership of Mayor Rawlings and the police chief, have implemented to strengthen the bonds between law enforcement officials and the communities that they serve. And that's important work. And the statistics indicate just how much progress they have made. Those efforts do make that community safer. They do make law enforcement officials safer. They do ensure that law enforcement officials are more effective in fighting crime.\nThat's one of the interesting things that -- again, some of the statistics that I've seen -- I'll let Dallas officials speak to this more directly -- but they were able to both succeed in driving down complaints about excessive force and other violent confrontations between law enforcement officers and citizens, and drive down the crime rate. That's an indication that the Dallas Police Department has figured out some critical reforms that benefit their community in a variety of ways.\nSo I think that does beg questions about the motive of this individual, and it's just something that's hard for me to speak to while -- both because this is an incident that only occurred in the last 18 hours, but also because law enforcement officials are seeking to learn as much information as they possibly can about what may have led to this incident.\nQ: Can I just ask you a broader kind of question? You have the attacks in Orlando, this threat of lone wolf terrorism. Overseas you have attacks that -- such as the one that happened in Istanbul. You have the CIA Director saying ISIS could attack in the U.S. in a similar way. You know, these shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana and -- in response to the racial disparities that the President talked about. And then you have what appears to be a retaliatory shooting of police officers. And these are obviously all very different and the motivations are different, but they're all happening at the same time, and they're creating a real sense of anxiety across the country, people who essentially don't feel safe in their communities anymore, and really don't feel that anywhere is safe. So how does the President think about that? How does he talk about that? How does he soothe the country at a time like this? And why should people feel that they are safe when things are so different now than they were even a year ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the situation that you described would provoke some level of anxiety in anyone, so I think the feelings that you are attributing to many Americans are understandable.\nWhat's clearly true is that the advances in social media and technology that brings so many of these images onto our smartphone or onto our television screen also has an impact on the way that many people react to these incidents. I think there is -- I'm certainly not a psychologist, but it seems reasonable to me to conclude that there is a material difference in the emotional response that is provoked when you read about something in the newspaper as opposed to seeing a violent image on your smartphone, something that you carry around every day in your pocket. That's going to leave a more personal and lasting emotional impact.\nI think what people should have confidence in are the kinds of things that we've long leaned on in difficult times. A significant portion of the community -- of the country, a large number of Americans, were quite concerned in the aftermath of the reports about shootings in Baton Rouge and in Minnesota earlier this week. And the response that we saw in Dallas -- peaceful Americans registering their concerns publicly, and having those rights be protected by police officers, having police officers literally put their lives on the line to protect innocent citizens and to protect their right to make their voices heard -- should give us a lot of confidence in the character of our men and women in law enforcement and in the character of the people of this country.\nThe President has that confidence. The President talked in his statement last night about how people of goodwill and people who are willing to act in good faith have a responsibility to come together to address some of these persistent problems in our criminal justice system. That's what Americans have been doing for generations. And this generation of Americans is absolutely as well prepared as any other to confront these challenges, to do so in a way that unites us.\nI think the fact that the Republican Speaker of the House and the Democratic President of the United States both calling for unity, even in the face of a remarkably divisive election year, I think is further evidence of that fact that the vast majority of Americans have their values in the right place. And those are the kinds of values that get us through tough times. And the President is incredibly confident that those values will serve us quite well as we confront these challenges, too.\nMR. RHODES: Just because you touched on the national security component, we've actually spent a fair amount of time obviously thinking about this issue in the context of terrorism, but it applies broadly, as you said, Carol.\nOne additional point I'd make is that being here in Poland reminds you that each generation has different, unique security challenges. If we had been having this discussion 30, 40 years ago, I think the thing that gave people a lot of anxiety was the risk of a nuclear war. And that was the context within which NATO was established, and that was its purpose for many decades.\nWe've seen since then different threats. We've seen war in the middle of Europe in the '90s. We saw a catastrophic terrorist attack on 9/11 that took thousands of lives. And then we saw the protracted conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which obviously carried an enormous cost for Americans, as well as many other people.\nI think what we see today is a security environment where even as we must maintain our commitment to NATO security, as we discussed, even as we're vigilant and wary for any potential state-on-state violence between major powers, that the threats have changed, and you see less of a concern about a nuclear conflict or a great-power conflict, but you do see individuals, for different reasons, seeking to draw attention to themselves, seeking to draw attention to their ideologies, by carrying out attacks, shootings in many different places and, again, with many different motivations.\nIn some ways, that is a new asymmetric security reality that we are addressing. And it's not something that is easily defeated with armies. But the one thing I would say, to echo a bit of what Josh said, is that what is striking is that the values of inclusivity, of working through a democratic process, of being able to air differences peacefully -- those are the same values that are needed in the European continent. Those are same values that would make it much easier to resolve conflicts in parts of the world that are being torn apart right now.\nAnd that is also what distinguishes the United States, is that in the aftermath of Orlando, you had very different communities speaking out against that type of action, from our Muslim-American community to our LGBT community to many other Americans.\nAnd so I do think that at this particular moment, this core question of whether or not we're going to respond to either heinous attacks, twisted individuals, or forces of disintegration by giving in to fear, and giving in to the forces of tribalism that want to pull people apart -- whether we're going to go that path, or whether we're going to stick to the values of democracy, inclusivity, pluralism that have gotten us this far, that's the fundamental question confronting not just the United States at home, but our transatlantic alliance and our global community.\nAnd so that is the threat I think that you cite in terms of the pattern of actions that obviously are very troubling. But at the same time, I think we also know what ultimately can defeat the intentions of those individuals.\nQ: Do you expect that the President will at some point address the American people in a broader way, or talk about this in -- like, how does he address this? Because, I mean, all those instances that you mention, Ben -- people turn to -- have historically looked to the President for guidance and leadership, and it's not clear to me what he sees his role as right now.\nMR. EARNEST: I've had limited access to television today, but I certainly do think that the powerful remarks that the President delivered last night and again this morning I think are certainly part of the way that the President communicates with the American public about his views on this topic.\nLook, even as we were flying to -- even as we were somewhere over the Atlantic yesterday, the President's Facebook page was updated with a specific message on these issues. So I think the President does feel not just a need but a desire to communicate with the American public about his perspective on these issues. And I think a lot of that is infused with his confidence in the ability of the American public to focus on what unites us and to use the strength that we gain from unity to confront these challenges.\nThat said, I'm confident that the President will have additional opportunities in the days ahead to discuss this again. My expectation is that the next opportunity he'll have to do so will be at the news conference that he plans to convene tomorrow. And I expect that the kinds of questions that all of you are asking me today are the kinds of questions that you'll ask him tomorrow.\nMike.\nQ: Josh, or to Ben, quickly, this morning obviously there were -- when the President spoke out about the incident in Dallas, we also heard from some of the other leaders here, offering their thoughts on it. Can you talk a little bit about, throughout the course of the day, any other interactions the President has had with leaders specifically on this issue?\nAnd I also wanted to ask, last night in his statement, which he seemed to be speaking often without notes, the President spoke more expansively about the heroism and the courage of the law enforcement community, and he seemed to want to underline this morning that he had spoken about that last night. I'm wondering what was driving that. Was there any sensitivity on his part to this view that some people have that he has perhaps put a thumb on the scale too much in speaking out so forcefully about disparities in the justice system against law enforcement?\nMR. RHODES: So I'll let Josh take the second. Just very quickly on the first. Every leader interaction that I was present for began with leaders expressing their condolences for what took place in Dallas. I would note it was particularly poignant that that was the very first thing that President Ghani of Afghanistan said, a country that, of course, has suffered enormous amounts of violence and loss of life. So, consistently throughout the day, clearly other world leaders were very struck by what happened in Dallas, and every one of them that I witnessed began their interactions with the President by extending their condolences.\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, I think the reason that the President -- well, let me start here. The comments that you heard from the President last night about his appreciation for law enforcement were not new to those of you who have covered the President for the last several years. The President often has an opportunity to talk about his profound admiration and his deep gratitude to the vast majority of men and women in law enforcement who do their job courageously and consistent with the values and expectations that we have for people who are responsible for justice. So those were certainly not new comments from the President.\nI think the second thing is that the President was interested in making clear that to acknowledge the reality of the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system doesn't diminish the service and sacrifice of the vast majority of law enforcement officers that do an outstanding job. And the President felt it was important to make that point precisely because there is a tendency in the aftermath of these high-profile incidents for people to engage in the kind of political rhetoric that ends up dividing people.\nThose kinds of divisions that are the result of some of that rhetoric are basic obstacles to our ability as a country to solve the problem. So that's why you hear the President express some hope that the response this time might be a little bit different than what it usually is. The usual retreating to our partisan corners is a significant obstacle to our ability to solve this problem. And the President acknowledged this, too, that there has been an effort underway on Capitol Hill for many months now to try to move bipartisan criminal justice reform that would address some of the disparities that the President touched on last night. We haven't been able to get over the hump yet.\nBut if we can resist the urge to resort to that political rhetoric, and focus, as Speaker Ryan did today, on the values that unite us, we're going to be much more likely to succeed in developing policy solutions that will have a tangible impact on these challenges.\nThe President is also realistic about this -- and, again, he acknowledged this last night, too. These are not the kinds of problems that are likely to be entirely solved in his lifetime or even in his children's lifetime, but there surely is progress that we can make. And I think when we see these kinds of incidents -- and I'm referring to Dallas, to Baton Rouge, and to Minnesota -- people of good faith have their conscience aroused and they recognize that these kinds of problems that are difficult to solve and, in some cases, easy to ignore are worth prioritizing. We need to make them a priority in our country.\nAnd the President is certainly determined to try to find -- to continue to try to find common ground, and to try to build the kinds of bridges that will make a solution to some of these challenges more likely.\nJustin.\nQ: Can I follow on that? I mean you were just talking about divisive rhetoric as an obstacle. And earlier, in response to Ron's question, you noted that some of -- you used that same phrase \"divisive rhetoric\" to describe some of the responses that we've seen out of Republican members of Congress. Is the President, or are you frustrated by those statements, and can you see even an implied linkage between what the President has had to say on these issues and what we saw in Dallas as an obstacle to our ability to solve the problem, or even worsening the problem?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, Justin, I was sort of intentionally making an effort to not spend a lot of time in responding to some of those comments. It's certainly entirely reasonable that you and Ron would ask about them. But the focus of our attention, as the President pointed out earlier today, should be on the families who are grieving. And we can also have a discussion about what values we have in common and how that might inform our efforts to try to address some of these problems. But I'll let those who are using that kind of rhetoric and casting those kinds of aspersions explain their rationale.\nQ: I wanted to ask about one specifically that you might give me the same answer to, but Joe Walsh, the former Republican from Illinois, tweeted and then deleted for the President to \"watch out\" after the shooting. Did you have any response to that specifically?\nMR. EARNEST: Not even an oblique one.\nMargaret.\nQ: The President talked about his concern about easy access to powerful weapons. Can you say, did he mean to -- was he saying semiautomatic weapons shouldn't be on the market, period? Or was he meaning to suggest that this shooter, an Army vet who doesn't appear a criminal record, legally should not have been able to purchase the weapon that he used?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President was not able to speak in a lot of detail because obviously there is an ongoing investigation. And I think there's still more that we need to learn about what exactly transpired, what motivated this individual to take these actions, what kind of weapons this person used to carry out these tragic shootings, and how this person was able to obtain these weapons.\nI think the President was just making a very broad point about his ongoing concern about the fact that many -- far too many innocent lives have been lost to gun violence. And the President is profoundly concerned about that because the President believes that there are at least some common-sense steps that could be taken to prevent at least some of those deaths. And the President has described the inability of Congress to make progress on those common-sense measures as the most frustrating thing that he has encountered as President of the United States. There are many frustrating things that any President confronts, but the President has found this issue to be the most frustrating. That's what the President was alluding to.\nBut as the President mentioned in his remarks, and as I've gone to great lengths to try to echo, our top priority right now and the focus of our attention right now should be on families who are grieving tonight.\nQ: As you know, people are going to criticize the President for that statement, given that so far it doesn't appear that should have been a reason that the shooter was prevented from obtaining weapons, right? He's an Army vet.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm unable to speak to the details about what exact weapon he was using. But we certainly know that there have been other incidents in which individuals were able to purchase an assault weapon and multiply the impact of the violence as a result.\nI don't know whether or not that applied in this case because I don't know what weapon this killer was using last night. But I think the President is just making the observation that there are some common-sense things that we could do that would make our communities safer, and there are far too many acts of gun violence that have taken far too many innocent lives.\nAnd the President has always gone to great lengths to point out that there is no single bill that could be passed that would prevent every single act of gun violence as a practical matter, but there are some common-sense things that we could do that would make our communities at least a little safer. And we can implement those policies without undermining the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. The President believes that we should do it.\nQ: Can you say whether the President is viewing this -- I know you can't speak to motivations, but is he viewing this -- it seems to be from the language he was using framed in a racial context. Is this a hate crime?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there are some people, again, who have raised that prospect. And there are some reports about what this individual might have said to police officers last night, and there are some who are speculating that that might provide some insight into this individual's motivation. I just think it's too early to jump to that conclusion at this point.\nWhat is clear is that this individual targeted police officers. This individual, this killer targeted police officers who had put on their uniform and were putting their life on the line to protect people who are exercising their constitutional right to free speech and freedom of assembly. And I think that is a powerful, maybe even chilling illustration of what our men and women in law enforcement do every single day. And unfortunately, five of those officers lost their lives doing it last night, and that's a genuine tragedy.\nQ: Can you say whether the President intends to -- or he has viewed the videos of the incidents he spoke about last night in Minnesota and in Louisiana?\nMR. EARNEST: I know the President has seen some of those images. I don't know if he's watched the entirety of the videos that have been posted online. But the President is certainly -- has seen those images, and he found them, as I mentioned yesterday, he found them deeply disturbing.\nQ: Which was it? Can you pinpoint for us what prompted the President last night, while he was on that flight across the Atlantic, having already watched news reports, to say this is something that I have to get out there and speak about?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think that is -- the fact that the President spoke last night about these issues I think is an indication of just how deeply and personally the President feels about these issues. The President is pained that our country's divisions have prevented as much progress as he would like to see on these persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system.\nThese issues are not new to the President. Before anybody ever heard of Barack Obama, when he was a state senator in Illinois, his landmark legislative achievement was negotiating with Democrats and Republicans, with civil rights leaders and law enforcement organizations, to pass legislation to try to address the problem of racial profiling in Illinois. And then-State Senator Barack Obama did succeed in working effectively with law enforcement and civil rights leaders to pass legislation that addressed that issue. So this is something the President has spent a lot of time thinking about. It's not new to him.\nAnd again, I think that's also what informed his comments last night. He's seen directly -- based on his own personal experience in talking to police officers across the country, including in Illinois, about how addressing the ruptured trust between law enforcement officials and some of the communities that they serve can make those law enforcement officials themselves safer as they do their job and more effective in fighting crime.\nSo this isn't -- clearly our values are critically important and making sure that we have a criminal justice system that treats people fairly regardless of the color of their skin should be a priority for all of us. But those who are unmoved by that values argument should be able to accept the reality of the very practical argument about how building some bridges makes the ability of police officers to do their job more safe and more effective.\nAny other questions? Okay. All right, Michelle, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Just a quick one. We're just wondering what President Obama said to President Duda about the constitutional issues going on. I mean, the Polish government seems to have its stance on that and the U.S. is facing its own issue with the Supreme Court, so I'm curious about that conversation.\nMR. EARNEST: They did have an opportunity to talk about it today, but I'll let Ben --\nMR. RHODES: They were able to discuss that issue. I think the President just underscored -- Poland has set an important democratic example for many other countries through the transition that it undertook to a democratic system, and I think the President simply encouraged President Duda to address these issues in a manner that fully preserves all of the democratic gains that have been made here in Poland, and protects the rights that so many Poles have struggled for over the years.\nSo again, I think -- we know there's an ongoing process here inside of Poland that's for the Polish people to undertake. Our belief and our commitment is that they continue to act in a way, and they choose to act in a way that upholds the democracy that has been built over the last two decades.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, everybody. You'll have an opportunity to hear from the President tomorrow evening at his news conference at the end of the NATO Summit. Have a good evening.\nEND 9:19 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118068", "text": "In the last 18 months, the United States has taken several steps to assure our allies in Europe and demonstrate our continued commitment to NATO collective defense. Operation ATLANTIC RESOLVE (OAR) is a demonstration of our dedication to enduring peace and stability in the North Atlantic area, and it will remain in place as long as needed to reassure our allies and partners, and deter an increasingly bellicose Russia. Deterrence requires ready and capable allies in Europe, which is why we have enhanced the frequency and complexity of exercises with NATO allies and partners, while augmenting the U.S. air, ground, and naval presence in the region. The U.S.-European strategic partnership is built on a foundation of shared values and common experience, and we build on that foundation with a robust training and exercise plan.\nEuropean Reassurance Initiative\nThe European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) is part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, signed by President Obama on December 19, 2014. The President's Budget request for FY 2017 includes a quadrupling in ERI funding over 2016 levels to approximately $3.42 billion, which will fund increased activities along five main lines of effort: increased rotational presence; additional bilateral & multilateral training with allies and partners; enhanced prepositioning of U.S. equipment; improved infrastructure; and intensified efforts to build capacity with newer NATO allies and partners. The sum of all ERI lines of effort is greater than the five individual parts, when considering that increased rotational presence allows us to sustain more frequent allied and partner exercises and therefore build interoperability more rapidly. Similarly, improving allied infrastructure builds national capacity in addition to increasing NATO responsiveness.\nFiscal Year 2017 ERI funding levels highlight a shift from assurance to deterrence and will permit more rotational U.S. forces in Europe, more training and exercises with our allies, more prepositioning and warfighting gear and infrastructure improvements to help support the U.S. and NATO allies shift towards a more credible defense posture. ERI ensures that all U.S. military services will augment their presence and enhance deterrence in Europe through stepped-up rotations and potential deferral of previously planned force reductions. In 2017, it will expand the scope of 28 joint and multi-national exercises, which annually train over 18,000 U.S. personnel alongside 45,000 NATO allies and Partnership for Peace personnel across 40 countries. Notably, ERI does not fund an increase in the number of U.S. troops permanently stationed in Europe, but it will support the presence of additional rotational forces that help us meet our collective defense obligations to NATO allies.\nLonger-Term U.S. Deployments\nUsing ERI funds, the United States has been able to increase the frequency and length of U.S. deployments to Europe, including:\n1st Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division: The Ft. Stewart-based armored brigade combat team has deployed to Europe several times in 2015 and 2016 in support of OAR. When in Europe, the brigade forward deploys units from the Baltic States to Bulgaria and also conducts training in the Republic of Georgia. During the brigade's current six-month deployment, it brought all its units together in Poland to participate in Exercise Anakonda.\n4th Infantry Division Mission Command Element: In 2014, the 4th Infantry Division deployed the Mission Command Element (MCE) to Baumholder, Germany, in order to serve as the intermediate headquarters between United States Army Europe and the U.S. Army forces that are in Europe participating in Operation Atlantic Resolve (AR).\nThe element provides a fundamental link between the regionally aligned forces, USAREUR headquarters personnel, and host nation entities across the AR area of operations. This effort ensures that both U.S. and allied forces achieve not only their individual objectives, but constantly increase their collective cohesiveness during a variety of bi-lateral and multi-national training exercises and direct engagements.\n2nd Cavalry Regiment: 2CR units out of Vilseck, Gemany deployed company teams to the Baltic State and Romania to support Atlantic Resolve activities in the region. These activities include tactical training with host nation forces, vehicle road marches for deployability, and community relations events to assure the public.\nF-22 Flying Training Detachment: In April and May, 2016, following a similar deployment from August to September 2015, the United States sent 12 F-22s to Europe. The aircrews primarily trained with their UK counterparts, but also flew several missions to Lithuania, Poland, and Romina for additional training and to demonstrate U.S. commitment to NATO.\nF-15 Theater Security Package: The United States deployed 12 F-15s to Europe from April through September 2016. A similar deployment was made in 2015. During the current deployment, aircraft from the Theater Security Package participated in NATO's Iceland Air Surveillance task and Estonian national exercise Spring Storm.\nA-10 Theater Security Package: From September 2015 through January 2016, and again in July 2016, the United States deployed 12 A-10 aircraft to Eastern Europe for training and to support OAR exercises. The A-10s trained at multiple bases across Europe, including Amari Air Base, Estonia; Kecskemet, Hungary; and Campia Turzii Air Base, Romania. These A-10s conducted training alongside allies and partners to strengthen interoperability and to demonstrate U.S. commitment to European security.\nTrain and Equip Ukraine's National Guard: Since April 2015, U.S. Army Europe's 173rd Airborne Brigade out of Vicenza, Italy has been training the Ukraine National Guard, focusing on internal defense.\nMajor Recent NATO and Multinational Exercises\nNATO allies have fully implemented the enhanced exercise regime to which allies committed as part of the Readiness Action Plan. NATO and select allies and partners conducted the following exercises to train elements of an enhanced NATO Response Force (NRF) that has tripled in size and can be deployed to all parts of the Alliance.\nAnakonda 16: This Polish national exercise was held at various locations in Poland from June 7-17, 2016, and was the largest multinational exercise held prior to the Warsaw Summit. Poland has held an Anakonda exercise every two years since 2006. The aim of this year's exercise was to develop the capability to command a joint defensive operation supported by a multinational coalition and in cooperation with civilian authorities. More than 31,000 soldiers from 24 nations participated.\nBALTOPS 16: A U.S. Navy-led exercise, BALTOPS is the premier maritime exercise in the Baltic Sea region and one of the largest exercises in northern Europe. Held from June 3-19, 2016, the aim was to demonstrate the interoperability of NATO allies and partners and to assure nations of NATO's commitment to the security and stability of the Baltic Sea region. Fifteen NATO and two partner nations participated in the 44th iteration of the multinational maritime exercise. Approximately 6,100 maritime, ground, and air force troops from participating nations demonstrated maritime interdiction, anti-subsurface warfare, amphibious operations, and air defense in a joint environment to ensure regional security.\nSwift Response 16: Swift Response is a U.S. Army Europe-led airborne crisis response exercise series that focuses on training the U.S. Global Response Force to conduct rapid, efficient and effective joint forcible entry operations alongside allied airborne forces in Europe. Swift Response 16, held from May 27 through June 26, 2016, included more than 5,000 soldiers and airmen from Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United States, and took place in Poland and Germany.\nSaber Strike 16: A long-standing U.S. Army Europe-led exercise, Saber Strike improves joint interoperability through a range of missions that prepare the 13 participating nations to support multinational contingency operations. The exercise, which took place from May 27-June 22 in multiple locations throughout Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, serves as an effective proving ground for units to validate their ability to assemble rapid-reaction forces and deploy them on short notices. Leading up to the exercise, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment will demonstrate U.S. land forces' dynamic presence throughout the region, exhibiting freedom of movement during a 2,200-kilometer tactical road march, called Dragoon Ride II, from Germany to Estonia.\nBrilliant Jump Deploy 16: This NATO exercise took place in Poland from May 17 to 27, 2016, and trained NATO's Very High Joint Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) to quickly deploy where needed. It tested the deployment of the VJTF's land elements, from their home location in Spain to the Zagan Military Training Area in Poland. Around 2,500 troops participated.\nBrilliant Jump Alert 16: The alert phase of NATO's Brilliant Jump exercise took place in Spain from April 1-10, 2016, and was designed to train and test the activation of the VJTF, the high-readiness force for first response in an emerging crisis. The exercise included the involvement of air, maritime and special operations forces.\nTrident Joust 16: NATO Exercise Trident Joust took place in Poland during April 12-26, 2016, as a NATO Response Force readiness exercise and was focused on regional command and control structures.\nDynamic Manta: Held from 22 February 22 through March 4, 2016, in the Ionian Sea, this NATO exercise tested anti-submarine warfare capabilities and included more than 5,000 sailors from 8 NATO nations.\nCold Response: U.S. Special Operations Command Europe components worked with NATO allies and partners from 13 nations in a Norwegian Joint Command Post Exercise/Field Training Exercise between February 29 and March 9, 2016. The exercise featured naval, land, and air Special Operations Forces operations to underscore NATO's ability to defend against any threat in any environment. The location in central Norway provided a unique, extreme cold-weather environment to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures and learn from one another. This exercise enables the NATO alliance to work together and demonstrate its ability to counter transnational threats.\nCombined Resolve: U.S.-led Exercise Combined Resolve V was held in Germany in early November 2015 and had more than 4,600 participants from 10 NATO allies and three 3 partner nations. The purpose was to execute a command post exercise that incorporated offensive and defensive operations focused on mission command in order to build capability, increase readiness, and develop the cohesiveness of U.S. and allied and partner nations.\nUSS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75): The Nimitz-class nuclear powered aircraft carrier operated in the Mediterranean Sea in November, 2015, to reaffirm the United States' commitment to promote peace and stability with our allies and partners.\nTrident Juncture: The largest NATO exercise conducted in the past 20 years with around 36,000 troops from more than 30 nations, including both NATO allies and partners was held from October through November 2015. More than 5,000 U.S. service members participated in the exercise, which was designed to train the troops of the NATO Response Force. Activities were hosted by Spain, Portugal and Italy with training in Belgium, Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway and at sea in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.\nKearsarge Amphibious Ready Group (ARG)/26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU): The Kearsarge ARG/26th MEU entered the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations in October 2015, and conducted naval operations in support of U.S. national security interests in Europe.\nSwift Response 15: Similar to Swift Response 16, the 2015 edition was a joint and combined certification training event that took place at multiple locations across Europe from August 18 through September 10, 2015, to exercise a multinational Brigade Task Force integrated from a coalition of 10 NATO nations. The exercise was built around an Airborne Combined Joint Forcible Entry operation, and served to evaluate brigade- and battalion- level execution of strategic out-load in conjunction with allies and partner nations. The event provided participants with the opportunity to integrate multiple partner nations' high-readiness forces to train as a cohesive and interoperable team.\nSaber Strike 15: The June 2015 edition of this U.S. Army Europe-led exercise focused on promoting interoperability with regional partners and improving joint operational capability in a variety of missions to prepare the participating nations and units for future operations. Twelve nations participated in the exercises which had events in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.\nBALTOPS 15: This U.S.-led exercise in June, 2015, included a multinational force of over 50 ships, included U.S. Marines, and demonstrated the interoperability of NATO allies and partners while assuring nations of NATO's commitment to security and stability in the Baltic Sea region.\nPlatinum Eagle: Over 120 Marines from the Black Sea Rotational Force and over 400 Romanian and Bulgarian military forces trained at Babadag Training Area, Romania, in May 2015. This was a battalion-level exercise to improve infantry skills and increase interoperability. Concurrent with this exercise, U.S. Marine Forces Europe / Africa conducted a sustainment exercise by deploying MV-22 aircraft from the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force, Crisis Response - Africa, to support the Black Sea Rotational Force's rapid response platoon.", "timestamp": "2016-07-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. Assurance and Deterrence Efforts in Support of NATO Allies"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118071", "text": "The United States and our 27 allies are strongly committed to NATO's three core tasks of collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. In pursuit of these tasks, NATO seeks a range of capabilities and other resources from allies. These capabilities are provided mostly from allied national inventories, but also in the form of military personnel assigned to the NATO Command Structure and a range of common-funded communications, command, control and intelligence capabilities to support that NATO Command Structure.\nLike all allies, the United States does not actually transfer forces to NATO until the Supreme Allied Commander Europe requests them for a particular NATO-led operation that has been authorized by NATO's North Atlantic Council. For purposes of coherently planning for future capabilities, NATO asks each allied nation, through the assignment of various \"capability targets,\" to develop or maintain in its inventory a fair share of the total capabilities that may be required by NATO. Allied defense ministers undertake to pursue these capability targets in their national defense plans.\nFor most allies, certain high-end conventional U.S. military capabilities, and an independent strategic-level nuclear deterrent, would be out of reach, due to cost or level of technology. Examples include large deck aircraft carrier battle forces, upper layer ballistic missile defense interceptor capability, advanced stand-off electronic warfare capability, and large-scale, globally-deployable logistics capabilities. The Alliance depends mainly on the United States for these long-range power projection-related capabilities that have high conventional deterrence value. Some allies have some of these capabilities, in limited quantities, but if they were not able to operate as part of a multinational force that includes predominantly U.S. enabling capabilities, most allies would not be able to mount an effective deterrent, nor conduct high intensity or large-scale, long duration operations. Therefore, declaring these enabling capabilities to be available to NATO, for planning purposes, can be an effective force multiplier for the United States, recognizing that additional allied forces include nearly two million military personnel equipped and potentially available for joint operations. At the same time, NATO has undertaken to reduce its over-reliance on the United States by asking other allies to develop more of these enabling capabilities. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which will introduce fifth generation fighter capability to several allied air forces, is a prime example.\nThe United States also funds about 22 percent of the relatively small NATO Common Funded budgets (approximately $685 million out of NATO's $2.8 billion per year) which finance shared capabilities that benefit all allies. This shared funding accounts for just 0.03 percent of the allied nations' aggregate defense spending, yet every $22 the United States contributes leverages $100 worth of Alliance capability. Common Funding supports, among other things, certain Alliance operational costs (such as in Afghanistan or Kosovo); NATO AWACS (see below); training and exercises; joint facilities and infrastructure; common communications; the NATO headquarters and staff; and NATO's unparalleled multinational integrated military command structure.\nFor that NATO Command Structure, the United States and other allies contribute military personnel (around 8,950 total) to staff the NATO Command Structure headquarters that command and control NATO operations. The United States provides around 930 personnel, or about 10 percent of the requirement, and hosts the headquarters of NATO's Allied Command Transformation as part of the community of military installations in and around Norfolk, Virginia.\nThe United States also contributes, with other allies, to certain multinational projects that achieve economies of scale in developing collective capabilities to support critical NATO operational requirements:\n• NATO Ballistic Missile Defense. In September 2009, the President announced the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) which provides missile defense to Europe. EPAA is a phased plan to provide regional ballistic missile defense (BMD) to protect Europe, including forward deployed U.S. forces. This system is neither capable against nor directed at Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent, but focuses instead on ballistic missile threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area. At the 2010 NATO Summit in Lisbon, allied heads of state and government agreed to develop a NATO regional missile defense capability and welcomed the EPAA as the U.S. contributions to NATO BMD. During the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, allies declared NATO BMD interim capability, which consisted of a deployed AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey, one Aegis ship deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a Command and Control Battle Management and Communication node at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. All three elements are under NATO command and control. EPAA Phase II began when the fourth U.S. BMD-capable Aegis ship forward deployed to Rota, Spain, and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) in Romania marked its operational certification on May 12, 2016. We anticipate an associated NATO milestone will be announced by allies at the Warsaw Summit. On May 13, 2016, the United States and allies also broke ground on construction of the AAMDS in Poland. When construction ends by December 2018, and the system is operationally certified, the third and final phase of EPAA will be complete.\n• NATO Airborne Early Warning Control (NAEW&C - \"NATO AWACS\"). The NAEW&C consists of 16 E-3A AWACS aircraft based in Geilenkirchen, Germany. The aircraft have had an important presence in NATO campaigns in Afghanistan, Libya, Kosovo, and the Mediterranean, as well as recently in assurance measures in the East and in Turkey. Sixteen nations contribute funding for modernization programs and certain operational costs related to the NAEW&C force, and the UK makes contributions-in-kind from its national inventory of 6 E-3D AWACS aircraft based in Waddington, UK. The two largest contributors are the U.S. (with a 40 percent cost share) and Germany (27 percent). The 16 Allied participants in the program are currently reviewing a $1 billion life-extension program that will keep the fleet operational through 2035. Simultaneously, NATO is in the initial stages of studying options for a follow-on Alliance Future Surveillance and Control capability after 2035.\n• Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system. AGS system capabilities will enable the Alliance to perform persistent high-altitude, long-endurance, and unmanned surveillance from aerial platforms with very advanced sensors. AGS includes five Global Hawk Block 40 unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as a ground and support segment. In September 2014, the AGS Force officially began to stand up at Sigonella Air Base, Italy, to prepare for the arrival of the first aircraft in late 2016. By the end of 2017, the AGS program will provide NATO five Global Hawks, with related ground-based systems. Fifteen NATO allies are together acquiring AGS for a total of Ђ1.3B, with the U.S. paying a 42 percent acquisition cost share for this critical requirement, as well as 28 percent of the operations costs which are shared across 26 nations.\n• NATO Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR). NATO's Chicago Summit endorsed a JISR capabilities initiative to create a network-centric capability that integrates disparate national and multinational ISR capabilities (such as AGS and NATO AWACs) and provides dedicated ISR command and control and training. In February 2016, NATO defense ministers declared that JISR had achieved initial operating capability, following improvements in NATO's JISR doctrine and procedures, training, and network architecture. The United States contributes to this network through NATO common funding and smaller multinational programs. Allies are now considering a longer-term, iterative capability-development strategy to advance this key enabling capability area.\n• C-17 Strategic Airlift Command (SAC). Ten NATO allies plus two Partnership for Peace countries work under a Memorandum of Understanding to operate three Boeing C-17 strategic transport aircraft out of Papa Air Base, Hungary. The participating nations each control a proportional share of the available fight hours, based on their respective acquisition cost shares, and may choose to make their hours available to support operations led by nations, by NATO or by the European Union. The U.S. acquisition cost share was 33 percent (for which the United States provided one C-17 aircraft as its contribution). The U.S. annual operations cost share is 31 percent (of a total annual cost of $153 million).\n• Precision-Guided Munitions (PGM). A multinational project, launched at the Wales Summit to address requirements for air-to-ground Precision-Guided Munitions (PGM), has grown to include eight allied nations. Now the participants are pursuing multinational procurement of U.S.-manufactured PGMs using the NATO Lead Nation Procurement Initiative, an innovative U.S. arrangement that allows a single lead nation from a multinational group to acquire U.S. systems through Foreign Military Sales and then transfer a portion of those systems to other participating nations without additional retransfer requests. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency has submitted Letter of Request documentation designed to enable several of these nations to acquire substantial numbers of PGMs. Implementation efforts are ongoing, and the initial procurement details should be finalized in the coming months.", "timestamp": "2016-07-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. Contributions to NATO Capabilities"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118072", "text": "The U.S.-Polish relationship is buttressed by our peoples' centuries-long pursuit of liberty and freedom—values that unite us as we strive together to create a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Americans and Poles have provided crucial help to each other at the most challenging times in our countries' histories as far back as the American Revolution; Poles Tadeusz Kosciuszko and Casimir Pulaski are honored as heroes of that struggle. In 1989, Americans celebrated Polish liberation from communism, the culmination of the Polish people's long struggle against oppression and authoritarianism. Since that time our shared values and commitment to democracy have allowed us to build deep and comprehensive security, economic, and societal relations.\nThe United States views Polish democracy as the foundation of our strong bilateral ties. As stated in NATO's founding document, our collective defense is \"founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law.\" In this regard, we are closely following the dispute over the Constitutional Tribunal and other issues relevant to the well-being of Poland's democratic institutions.\nStrengthening Military Cooperation in Defense of Shared Values\nSecurity is a fundamental pillar of the U.S.-Poland bilateral relationship and our defense ties have never been stronger. Poland's 10-year, $35 billion defense modernization program is an important investment in the country's defense capabilities and will increase the Polish military's interoperability with NATO allies—allowing us to jointly enhance NATO's collective defense, deterrence, and resiliency. Poland has committed to be a Framework Nation for NATO's Very High Readiness Task Force, established a NATO Force Integration Unit, and hosts the enhanced NATO Headquarters Multinational Corps Northeast, whose chief of staff is a U.S. brigadier general. Poland is contributing to NATO's rotational presence in the Baltic States with the Visegrad Group and supports regional security through the Lithuania-Poland-Ukraine Brigade. Poland contributes to overall Alliance and U.S.-led efforts through the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, entry into NATO's humanitarian efforts in the Aegean Sea, and support for the Counter-ISIL Coalition through its upcoming deployment of F-16s and Special Forces trainers to Kuwait and Iraq to help combat ISIL.\nThrough Operation Atlantic Resolve, the United States undertakes intensive military exercises with Poland and other Allies. The United States maintains a full-time aviation detachment at ?ask Air Base, which hosts regular joint training rotations combining U.S. and Polish F-16s. In May 2016, the United States broke ground on construction of phase three of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) to missile defense. The missile defense site in Redzikowo, Poland, will integrate with NATO to protect Europe and U.S. forces on the continent from ballistic missile threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2017, The United States plans to augment its force presence in Europe through a heel-to-toe rotational deployment of an armored brigade combat team, as well as pre-positioning the equipment for a second armored brigade combat team in Europe. We will deploy the armored brigade combat team headquarters and elements of the rotational brigade in Poland. We have also committed to serve as the Framework Nation in Poland for NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence in the east.\nBuilding Prosperity Through Deepened Economic Cooperation\nU.S.-Polish economic ties are dynamic and wide-ranging, and both governments are committed to identifying additional trade opportunities. During the Obama Administration, bilateral merchandise trade with Poland has more than doubled, from $4.3 billion in 2009 to $9.3 billion in 2015. More than 200,000 Poles are employed directly by U.S. companies, and U.S. firms are some of the largest sources of foreign direct investment in Poland, having invested more than $30 billion in the country. In June 2016, approximately 20 Polish delegates participated in the third SelectUSA Investment Summit, a demonstration of Poland's growing interest in the U.S. market.\nThe conclusion of a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership treaty (T-TIP) will deepen our bilateral commercial relationship. The United States government has identified six critical areas for U.S. companies' engagement in Poland: infrastructure, green-building, intelligent transportation systems, energy, defense, and information technology.\nThe United States prioritizes energy cooperation with Poland to promote a more secure, cleaner, and more sustainable energy future. The opening of the Swinoujscie liquefied natural gas terminal is a necessary and welcome step in Poland's efforts to improve its energy security. Poland's investments in innovative technologies such as unconventional gas extraction, nuclear power, and renewable energy could also provide new, more secure energy sources as well. U.S. firms that are developing the latest high technology in wind and solar equipment are also invested in Poland's renewable energy sector.\nPeople-to-People Ties an Enduring Feature of Bilateral Relations\nSome of the first settlers at Jamestown Colony were Polish craftsmen brought by Captain John Smith in 1608. Almost 10 million Americans today claim Polish ancestry, providing unwavering support for close U.S.-Poland relations. The Polish-U.S. Fulbright Commission has funded more than 1,900 Poles and 1,000 American exchanges over its 60-year history. Poland is also part of the Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) student program, which will send 30 Polish high school juniors to live and study in the United States this year. A robust International Visitors Leadership Program (IVLP) sends about 30 Polish professional grantees annually to the United States, and recent programs focused on such issues as cybersecurity, LGBT issues, and women in foreign affairs. American Corners throughout Poland bring American history, culture, arts, and values to young Poles, and an active sports diplomacy program, partnering with Polish NBA star Marcin Gortat to support summer youth camps, further expands youth outreach. In cooperation with the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, five Polish high school teachers each year attend teacher training programs administered by the U.S.-based Association of Holocaust Organizations (AHO).", "timestamp": "2016-07-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-Poland Relations"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118124", "text": "On July 8-9, 2016, President Obama and the heads of state and government of our 27 NATO allies, plus new observer state Montenegro, will gather in Warsaw, Poland, for a pivotal NATO Summit, the 27th since the signing of the Washington Treaty that established the Alliance in 1949. The last NATO Summit occurred in September 2014 in Wales.\nThe summit will underscore NATO unity as allied leaders focus on defense, deterrence, and projecting stability beyond NATO's borders, ensuring the Alliance adapts to meet the full range of 21st century security challenges. To the east, Russia's aggression against Ukraine threatens our vision of a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. To the south, the terrorist threat from ISIL poses a growing danger to more allies, while the refugee and migrant crisis poses new challenges to Europe. At the summit, NATO will ensure it is able to respond to the full spectrum of security challenges from any direction.\nStrengthening and modernizing NATO's deterrence and defense posture will be a key deliverable at the summit. The 2014 Wales Summit focused on assurance and beginning to improve the readiness of allied forces. At the Warsaw Summit, allies will mark the full implementation of NATO's Readiness Action Plan - including the tripling in size of the NATO Response Force with a brigade-sized high-readiness spearhead force at its core able to move within in a matter of days. Leaders will note solid progress towards the pledge on defense investment, and go beyond the assurance paradigm by modernizing the Alliance's deterrence and defense posture.\nSpecifically, allied leaders will take decisions to enhance collective defense by enhancing NATO's forward presence on the eastern flank through the deployment of one rotational battalion each in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, as well as developing a tailored forward presence in Romania and Bulgaria. In addition, NATO will further develop the Alliance's ballistic missile defense capabilities, and ensure its nuclear deterrent remains credible, safe, secure, and effective. Allies will also take steps to build resilience against non-traditional challenges such as hybrid tactics, cyber vulnerabilities, and terrorist threats as essential components of credible deterrence and defense. Each of these efforts supports the explicit commitments allies have to one another in Articles 3 and 5 of the Washington Treaty regarding our individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack, the indivisibility of our security, and our mutual responsibility to contribute to collective defense.\nTogether, these measures represent the largest reinforcement of NATO's collective defence and deterrence since the end of the Cold War. NATO does not seek confrontation, but will defend all allies against any threat. Everything NATO does is defensive, proportionate, and in line with each ally's international commitments. Our deterrence and defense aims not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent one.\nAllies will also decide at the summit to expand the Alliance's efforts to project stability beyond NATO's borders. All NATO allies are members of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (C-ISIL), and the Alliance will take additional steps at the summit to bolster C-ISIL efforts, including through direct NATO support to the C-ISIL coalition as well as through enhanced training of the Iraqi Security Forces. In the Aegean Sea, NATO is already providing capabilities to support EU and national efforts to address the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, and will seek to decide to further enhance our maritime security cooperation with the European Union to help address the security challenges in the Central Mediterranean Sea. NATO is also focusing and intensifying its defense capacity building and other areas of security cooperation with regional partners, such as Iraq, Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania to address the root causes of instability.\nAllies will also modernize their approach to partnerships more broadly. NATO's partners are crucial security providers, many having contributed to NATO's ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Kosovo. At the summit, NATO will also highlight closer cooperation with the European Union as key to dealing with the evolving security environment and challenges faced by both organizations in concrete areas, such as fighting hybrid and cyber threats, supporting our partners in defence capacity building, and increasing maritime security.\nThis collaboration is enhanced by the Alliance's deepening cooperation with regional partners like Sweden and Finland, whose leaders will participate in Warsaw. NATO continues its assistance to partners in the East, such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova to strengthen resilience and boost self-defense capabilities - in particular, with a comprehensive package of assistance for Ukraine and by strengthening the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package agreed at Wales.\nThe Alliance remains committed to Afghanistan's stability. At the summit, allies will agree to continue the Resolute Support train, advise, and assist mission in a flexible regional format beyond 2016, and just as crucially to sustain donor financial assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces through 2020 so the Afghans can defend their country and push back violent extremism.\nIn December 2015, allies unanimously agreed to invite Montenegro to begin accession talks with NATO, and in May 2016 signed the Accession Protocol that will lead to membership once ratified by all NATO members. Montenegro will participate in all Warsaw Summit meetings. Its forthcoming membership will enhance stability in the Western Balkans and demonstrate the Alliance's enduring commitment to its Open Door policy.", "timestamp": "2016-07-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: NATO Warsaw Summit"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:19 a.m. in Baltic Ballroom No. 3 at the Warsaw Marriott Hotel. In his remarks, he referred to Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Michael J. Smith, and Patrick Zamarripa, Dallas Police Department officers, and Brent Thompson, Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer, who were killed in the shootings at a public demonstration in Dallas, TX, on July 7; Prime Minister David W.D. Cameron of the United Kingdom; and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization. President Tusk referred to former U.S. President George H.W. Bush.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117883", "text": "President Obama. Good morning, everybody. Let me begin by thanking Presidents Tusk and Juncker for the opportunity to meet today.\nShooting of Law Enforcement Officers in Dallas, Texas\nWith your understanding, I want to begin with a few words about the situation back in the United States, specifically the situation in Dallas, Texas.\nMy team has been keeping me updated throughout the morning, the evening in Dallas. I spoke this morning with Mayor Rawlings of Dallas to convey the deepest condolences of the American people. I told him that the Federal Government will provide whatever assistance Dallas may need as it deals with this tremendous tragedy.\nWe still don't know all the facts. What we do know is that there has been a vicious, calculated, and despicable attack on law enforcement. Police in Dallas were on duty, during—doing their jobs, keeping people safe during peaceful protests. These law enforcement officers were targeted, and nearly a dozen officers were shot. Five were killed. Other officers and at least one civilian were wounded, some are in serious condition, and we are praying for their recovery.\nAs I told Mayor Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas. According to police, there are multiple suspects. We will learn more, undoubtedly, about their twisted motivations. But let's be clear: There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement. The FBI is already in touch with the Dallas police, and anyone involved in these senseless murders will be held fully accountable. Justice will be done.\nI will have more to say about this as the facts become more clear. For now, let me just say that even as yesterday I spoke about our need to be concerned, as all Americans, about racial disparities in our criminal justice system, I also said yesterday that our police have an extraordinarily difficult job and the vast majority of them do their job in outstanding fashion. I also indicated the degree to which we need to be supportive of those officers who do their job each and every day, protecting us and protecting our communities.\nToday is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices that they make for us. We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately, it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead, we're going to have to consider those realities as well.\nIn the meantime, today our focus is on the victims and their families. They are heartbroken. The entire city of Dallas is grieving. Police across America, which is a tight-knit family, feels this loss to their core. And we're grieving with them. I'd ask all Americans to say a prayer for these officers and their families. Keep them in their—in your thoughts. And as a nation, let's remember to express our profound gratitude to our men and women in blue, not just today, but every day.\nEuropean Union-U.S. Relations\nWith that, I want to thank Presidents Tusk and Juncker for our work here today in Warsaw. I've worked with Donald in his previous capacity as Prime Minister here in Poland, and I've appreciated this chance to work with Jean-Claude.\nOur meeting comes, as I think everybody is aware, at a critical moment for the European Union. The vote in the United Kingdom to leave the EU has created uncertainty about the future of European integration. And unfortunately, this has led some to suggest that the entire edifice of European security and prosperity is crumbling. There are those who have been questioning what does this mean for the transatlantic relationship. Let me just say, as is often the case in moments of change, this kind of hyperbole is misplaced. I want to take the opportunity to reaffirm some basic points that bear repeating.\nFirst, based on my recent discussions with Prime Minister Cameron, Chancellor Merkel, and now here today, I am absolutely confident that the U.K. and the European Union will work together in a pragmatic and cooperative fashion to ensure that the U.K.'s transition is orderly and smooth. No one has an interest in protracted, adversarial negotiations. Everybody has an interest in minimizing any disruptions as the U.K. and the EU forge a new relationship.\nSecond, even as we face the difficulties of this moment, we cannot lose sight of the extraordinary achievement that European integration continues to be: more than 500 million people speaking 24 different official languages in more than two dozen countries, 19 with a common currency. Every member of the EU is a democracy. No EU country has ever raised arms against another. An integrated Europe is one of the greatest political and economic achievements of modern times, and this is an achievement that has to be preserved.\nThird, and for all the reasons I just mentioned, the United States has a strong and enduring interest in a united, democratic Europe. We're bound together by ties of history, family and our common values: our commitment to democracy, pluralism, human dignity. Our economies are deeply woven together, with the largest trade and investment relationship in the world. The security of America and Europe is indivisible, and that's why, for nearly 70 years, the United States has been a staunch champion of European integration, and we will remain so.\nFourth, given our shared interests, Europe will remain a cornerstone of America's engagement with the world. European countries are and will remain among our closest allies and friends, and Europe is an indispensable partner around the globe. Indeed, even as we manage the implications of Brexit, our work today shows that we're going to continue to be focused on pressing global challenges.\nWe agree that the United States and the EU can do more together for our shared security. And we'll keep working to provide each other information to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and prevent terrorist attacks, and we will do so in a way that continues to protect privacy and civil liberties. As the global coalition pushes ISIL back on the ground in Syria and Iraq, the EU has pledged critical financial assistance to help shore up the Iraqi economy and stabilize liberated communities. And as NATO nations affirm their commitment to Afghanistan's security, I want to commend, once again, the EU for taking the lead in mobilizing international assistance for development in Afghanistan. Here in Europe, we'll continue to support Ukraine as it undertakes important political and economic reforms. The U.S. and EU are united in our commitment to maintaining sanctions on Russia until they fully implement its obligations under the Minsk agreement. And with President Tusk and Juncker set to attend today's North Atlantic Council meeting, we have an opportunity to deepen security cooperation between NATO and the EU.\nWe also agree that, on both sides of the Atlantic, we have to address economic frustrations and anxieties of many of our people, feelings that undoubtedly contributed to the Brexit vote, fears that they're leaving—being left behind by globalization and economic integration. Our governments, including the EU, cannot be remote institutions; they have to be responsive and move more quickly, with minimal bureaucracy, to deliver real economic progress in the lives of ordinary people.\nAnd particularly, we discussed the importance of public investments—like infrastructure, education, innovation, and security—to stimulate growth and job training to help reduce inequality and unemployment, especially for young people here in Europe. That's been the right thing to do for years, both for the long term and the short term. But at a time when heightened uncertainty in the global economy is potentially amplifying the headwinds that we all face, these policies make even more sense today.\nWe're going to keep working to help Europe enhance its energy security with more diverse and resilient supplies, including from the United States. And while we are mindful of the challenges, we are going to continue to pursue a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T-TIP, to help sustain jobs and growth in all of our countries and to help reinforce the larger transatlantic relationship.\nAnd finally, we're stepping up to cooperate on global challenges. And I want to take this opportunity to commend the EU for the generosity and compassion that so many EU countries have shown desperate migrants—men, women, and children—who have fled to Europe. We believe NATO can do more to support EU naval operations in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas to prevent the exploitation of migrants. I expect the EU to play a major role at our refugee summit this fall at the United Nations, where we aim to secure new contributions to address the global refugee crisis.\nAnd with respect to the threat of climate change, we look forward to all EU countries ratifying the Paris Agreement and to the EU joining it. We continue to see EU—the EU as one of our strongest partners in reducing emissions, phasing out dangerous HFCs, and investing in clean energy.\nSo, again, I want to thank Donald and Jean-Claude for our work together. Despite the challenge of this moment, I'm pleased to see that the United States and the EU continue to deepen our partnership. The world needs a strong, prosperous, democratic, and united Europe. And in that cause, you will always have a strong and steady partner in the United States of America.\nThank you very much.\nPresident Tusk. Before anything else, I want to say that I am deeply sorry about what has happened in Dallas. We are with you in this, as well as with the families and loved ones of the victims. And sorry again.\nThis is my third and also my last meeting in Warsaw with Barack Obama as President of the United States of America. But I believe we will see each other again here in Poland, perhaps in less official roles. And, Barack, you know that you will always be here a most welcome guest. You know that, I'm sure.\nOver many years, we have worked together to strengthen the relation between Europe and the United States. Today, the need for such effort is even more visible. I remember 27 years ago, it was in my hometown of Gdansk, members of—when members of Solidarity welcomed George Bush Senior outside of the famous gate of the Gdansk shipyards. And we were chanting, \"Nie ma wolności bez solidarności,\" which means, \"There is no freedom without solidarity.\" We already knew then that our newly gained freedom would require defense and guarantees, which, in a global dimension, implied the closest possible cooperation between Europe and the United States.\nToday, we can repeat that phrase with only a small change; it has preserved its meaning. There is no freedom in Europe without Atlantic solidarity. Caring for the unity of the whole political community of the West is key. Whether we are discussing the referendum in the United Kingdom, the situation in Ukraine, or our future trade deals, we realize how much effort and how many new arguments we need to prevent political entropy and disintegration.\nWe know that the geopolitical consequences of Brexit may be very serious. Maintaining the closest possible relations between the EU and the U.K. is in European and American interest. But it is equally important to send today a strong message to the whole world that Brexit, as sad and meaningful as it is, is just an incident and not the beginning of a process. And to all our opponents, on the inside and out, who are hoping for a sequel to Brexit, I want to say loud and clear, you won't see on the screen the words \"To be continued.\"\nThere's no good alternative to transatlantic cooperation. All those who value our fundamental principles of freedom, the rule of law, democracy, human and civil rights must act in favor of this cooperation. This is the essence of our ties between America, known as the New World, and Europe, known as the Old Continent. We know, however, that besides the old world and the new world, there's also a world apart, with different values and different strategic ends. And it has allies also in the U.S.A., in Europe, and here in Poland.\nIn public debates in Washington, London, Berlin, Paris, and Warsaw, we hear antidemocratic slogans more and more, calling for national egoism, isolationism, Euroscepticism. It would be good if we clearly stated today that whoever turns against America harms Europe. Whoever attacks the European Union harms America. And whoever undermines the foundations of liberal democracy harms one and the other.\nWe have been building liberal democracy with determination on both sides of the Atlantic. We have followed the lessons of the same scholars. We have been inspired by the same political philosophies. We must now protect this heritage, both rich and, indeed, surprisingly fresh. What comes to my mind on this occasion is a quote by Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States of America: \"In questions of powers, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.\"\nThank you.\nPresident Juncker. Yes. Good morning. I would like to express my sympathy to the President of the United States and to the people of this great nation for the tragic events which happened yesterday night in Dallas, Texas. These events, like others, are proving and showing that we are living in a world which is developing increasingly to more complexity and to more uncertainty. The threats to our security takes many forms, and they are not located in any one place.\nTherefore, our first duty is to show unity and reaffirm the values we share: human rights, freedom, democracy, and the keystone on which the other rests, the rule of law. They go to the core of the Euro-Atlantic Alliance, and they make us who we are, and they do guarantee our way of life.\nThe United States, NATO, and European Union are central pillars of the global order. We complement each other and together provide peace and stability in Europe, our neighborhood, and beyond. Our combined strength remains formidable, but still, we can work more closely together, and that is why we are here today.\nWe were discussing, in the course of this morning's meeting, the consequences entailed by the vote of the British people to leave the European Union. I would like to repeat here what we have said in Brussels the other day, that we cannot start negotiations until the British authorities will not have notified, under the regime of article 50, their intention to leave the European Union. But then, we have to engage in negotiations. And I'm not doing this, how could I say, in hostile mood. I do think that, even after the referendum, the European Union and the United Kingdom share a community of interests, not only in the defense and the military sector, but in all the relevant sectors of international life, mainly as far as trade is concerned.\nBut if a country wants to have a free access to the entire market, it's for sure that this country has to respect the four basic freedoms, including the one of the freedom of movement for workers. But we'll have these negotiations with our British friends. And I do think that it's in our interest and in the global interest to keep Britain as a strong ally anyway in NATO and as a strong partner when it comes to the relations of this then third country with the European Union.\nAs time is running out, Barack, I will stop here, not without having said that we were discussing the T-TIP issue and that we want to conclude these negotiations before the end of this year, as—mainly as far as the big blocks of this negotiation are concerned. You will ask the European Council, I was asking leaders one after the other if yes or no, the European Union should continue to negotiate, and we received once again the mandate to conclude these negotiations.\nThanks so much, also for what—for your leadership during the last years. Thank you, Barack.", "timestamp": "2016-07-08", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Donald Franciszek Tusk of the European Council and President Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission in Warsaw, Poland"}

Excellency, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much that in my capacity as President of the Republic of Poland, I can welcome the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama, to Warsaw, to NATO summit. It is my great pleasure because I hope that this summit will have a historic character and historic dimension.\nIn both meetings, on the one hand, as regards the demonstration of the unity, coherence, and solidarity within the North Atlantic Alliance, among its member states, indivisibility and security within NATO. Also, the unity as regards territorial security that we are speaking with one voice, that we are together. But on the other hand, this summit is significant as regards the construction of an ever-more strategic and robust partnership between Poland and the United States.\nThis partnership is there; this partnership is materializing both in the economic dimension, where cooperation is going smoothly, but recently, it has also materialized as regards military cooperation: in other words, joint construction of the security zone. And for that, we are grateful to Mr. President and the United States. We are grateful for their friendliness. We are also grateful for the understanding that security is there where the strongest armed forces in the world are present. And the strongest armed forces of the world is the Armed Forces of the United States, as we all know.\nAnd that is why we welcomed American troops to the Anaconda exercise. We were hugely pleased that they were so numerous. We are also happy that a heavy brigade of the United States will be operating in the territory of Poland. We are pleased that the United States is providing such a decisive support to this reinforcement of the military potential of the North Atlantic Alliance. In our part of Europe, in Central Europe, about which we are saying that it is the eastern flank of NATO. So thank you for all those actions.\nWe had a very good conversation with Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, for accepting my condolences, because although we are busy, working people, nevertheless, the tragic information on what happened in Dallas, of course, has reached Poland as well. And on to the hands of Mr. President, I expressed my condolences for the American nation. But first and foremost, I want to express those condolences to the families of the police officers who died on duty. And these significant—the ethos of duty is very strong in the United States. It is an element of the great patriotism. And I had this opportunity to see that myself when I talked to American commanders and to American troops during Anaconda exercise. So, Mr. President, once again, please accept my words of sympathy and condolences. Unfortunately, this is what happens in life. At times, such tragedies happen.\nLadies and gentlemen, myself and Mr. President discussed a wide range of topic. We touched upon all the important issues. We discussed Brexit. I'm happy that Mr. President has got a very clear position, namely that the U.K. will keep its position within the North Atlantic Alliance, because this is a crucial country and our extremely important partner. We would like that partner to strengthen their potential. We also discussed the issue of migration. I told Mr. President that we are supporting in the spirit of solidarity the actions of the allied armed forces also in the South by deploying our troops there, a Polish F-16 aircraft and Kościuszko brigade. We had a very good conversation. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for that.\nThere is still a lot of work ahead of us at this summit today, some hard work. But I believe, as I have already said, that this summit is going to be symbolic in nature. It is going to further strengthen our strategic partnership. Polish people like America. Polish people like Americans. And we are hugely pleased with your presence here in Warsaw, Mr. President, both today and tomorrow.\nThank you.\nPresident Obama. Well, dzień dobry. Thank you, President Duda, for welcoming me today. This is my third visit to Poland as President. I've got very fond memories of my visit here 2 years ago when I joined Poles in Castle Square to celebrate a quarter century of Polish freedom. And it's wonderful to be back. As always, I bring greetings and friendship of the American people, especially the many proud Polish Americans, many of whom live in my hometown of Chicago.\nWe're here, of course, for the NATO summit, and the fact that it's being held here in Warsaw is a testament to Polish leadership. In the United States, we consider Poland one of our most committed and important allies. Poland is a leader in NATO as one of the nations that pays its full share—2 percent of GDP—for our collective security. Poland supports alliance missions, including in Afghanistan, and I thank Poland for its new contributions to the campaign against ISIL: F-16 aircraft and special forces trainers. And Poland has stepped forward as host of interceptor sites for our defense system against ballistic missiles from countries like Iran and as a linchpin in the defense of NATO's eastern flank.\nHere in Warsaw, I want to once again affirm the enduring commitment of the United States to the security of Poland. As treaty allies, we have a solemn, binding article 5 duty to defend each other. And in this obligation, we will never waver. These are not just words, they are backed up by deeds. When I first came here 5 years ago, I promised to increase our commitment to Poland's security, and that's exactly what we've done. We have kept our promise.\nWe now have a continuous presence of U.S. troops in Poland with our aviation detachment at Lask Air Base. We continuously rotate personnel and aircraft into Poland. Under the European Reassurance Initiative that I announced here 2 years ago, we've increased training, exercises, and readiness. Earlier this year, I announced a four-fold increase to this effort, proposing $3.4 billion to preposition more U.S. heavy equipment in this region and to continuously rotate an armored brigade in Europe.\nToday, I'm announcing further steps to bolster NATO's defense and deterrence posture. As the alliance prepares to enhance our forward presence in Central and Eastern Europe, I can announce that the United States will be the lead nation for the U.S.—for the NATO enhanced presence here in Poland. And that means the United States will deploy a battalion—roughly 1,000 American soldiers—here, in Poland, on a rotational basis to serve shoulder to shoulder with Polish soldiers.\nIn addition, when the new U.S. armored brigade begins rotating through Europe early next year, its headquarters will be here in Poland. In other words, Poland is going to be seeing an increase in NATO and American personnel and the most modern, capable military equipment, because we will meet our article 5 obligations to our common defense.\nMore broadly, I want to thank Poland for its continued strong support for Ukraine's efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression. We discussed the importance of continuing to provide Ukraine with the assistance it needs to strengthen its military and to pursue political and economic reforms. And we fully support the efforts led by Germany and France to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine diplomatically. And the United States and Poland are united in insisting that sanctions remain in place until Russia fully meets its obligations under the Minsk agreement.\nOn the economic front, our two countries will continue to work together to enhance Poland's energy security. Poland recently opened new terminals to receive liquefied natural gas, and the President was describing in detail the plans involved in these facilities. This is going to help diversify Poland's energy supply. American companies are investing their high-tech expertise in wind and solar to help Poland harness more renewable energy. And we'll continue to deepen our cooperation as we pursue a cleaner, more sustainable energy future together.\nAnd finally, I want to congratulate Poland on recently celebrating the 225th anniversary of its Constitution, the oldest written Constitution in Europe. And this speaks to the long yearning of the Polish people for freedom and independence. Indeed, after the cold war, the rebirth of Polish democracy was an inspiration to people across Europe and around the world, including in America. Because Poland's progress shows that democracy and pluralism are not unique to any one of our cultures or countries, they are describing universal values. And a central tenet of American foreign policy is that we speak up for these values around the world, even with our closest allies.\nAnd it's in that spirit that I expressed to President Duda our concerns over certain actions and the impasse around the Poland's Constitutional Tribunal. I insisted that we are very respectful of Poland's sovereignty, and I recognize that Parliament is working on legislation to take some important steps, but more work needs to be done. And as our—as your friend and ally, we've urged all parties to work together to sustain Poland's democratic institutions. That's what make us democracies: not just by the words written in constitutions or in the fact that we vote in elections, but the institutions we depend upon every day, such as rule of law, independent judiciaries, and a free press. And these are, I know, values that the President cares about. These are values that are at the heart of our alliance, which was founded, in the words of the North Atlantic Treaty, \"on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law.\"\nAnd when I think of all the progress that we celebrated 2 years ago in Castle Square—all the odds that the people of Poland have overcome throughout history and how the Solidarity movement helped defeat communism, the freedom that the Poles have won—it makes me confident in the future of Polish democracy and the fact that Poland stands and needs to continue stand as an example for democratic practices around the world. With the new commitments that I'm announcing today, the people of Poland and our allies across the region can remain confident that NATO will stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, no matter what, today and always.\nSo, again, Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality. Thank you to the Polish people. I know that it's a lot of work to prepare for these summits, but I can tell that you've done an outstanding job, and I'm sure it will be a great success. So dziękuję bardzo, President Duda.\nPresident Duda. Thank you very much, Mr. President.", "timestamp": "2016-07-08", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Andrzej Duda of Poland in Warsaw, Poland"}

Being a cop wasn't just what they did. It was who they were—like every officer who joined for essentially the same reason. There was something about them that made them think they could help, that they should serve, that they had a duty.\nSo when an assassin's bullet targeted the police force in Dallas, it touched the soul of the nation. Those killed and wounded were protecting the safety of those who were peacefully protesting against racial injustices in the criminal justice system. Those who were marching against the kind of shocking images we saw in St. Paul and Baton Rouge—and have seen too often elsewhere—of too many black lives lost.\nI believe the Dallas Police Department is one of the finest in the nation—and this incredibly diverse city can bridge any divide. To paraphrase Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, let us use our words carefully. Let us act with unity, not division. As Dallas Police Chief David Brown—one of the leading chiefs in America—said, \"There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city, all I know is that this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens.\"\nAs Americans, we are wounded by all of these deaths. It's on all of us to stand up, to speak out about disparities in our criminal justice system—just as it's on all of us to stand up for the police who protect us in our communities every day. In the days and weeks ahead, we'll continue offering our thoughts and prayers to provide comfort to the broken-hearted families. But they will only be redeemed by the courage of our actions that honor their memories.\nSo while we're being tested, we can't be pulled apart. We are America, with bonds that hold us together.

Rice's video message, click HERE.\nI want to convey my greetings and that of President Obama and the United States of America to you, the people of South Sudan, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of your hard-won independence.\nI remember so vividly the joy the world felt four years ago welcoming South Sudan into the community of nations. I remember the pride I personally felt standing in that huge crowd in Juba with my thirteen year-old son and the people of South Sudan to celebrate the end of a decades-long civil war and the birth of the world's newest nation. I remember the hope and unity of that day—the promise of a new beginning for you, who had suffered so much and persevered for so long. Four years later, those happy memories are a horrifying reminder of all that has been lost.\nIt breaks my heart to see what South Sudan has become today.\nMassive and widespread violence has returned. Human rights abuses are rampant. The Government and rebels are committing appalling crimes against innocent women, children, and the elderly. President Kiir and Riek Machar and their cronies are personally responsible for this new war and self-inflicted disaster. And only leaders on both sides can end this violence.\nYet, President Kiir and Riek Machar would rather haggle over personal power and wealth than agree on solutions. Meanwhile, you, the people of South Sudan, continue to suffer. Almost half of South Sudan's population is now dependent on the international community for its very survival, and more than two million people have been displaced from their homes.\nOver the past 19 months, the government has abdicated its responsibilities, failed to protect its citizens, and squandered its legitimacy. Instead of negotiating a resolution to the conflict, it has subverted democracy and unilaterally extended its mandate. As the violence drags on, the conflict not only scars the lives of innocent South Sudanese, it threatens to destabilize the wider region.\nThrough all these challenges, your neighbors, our regional partners, have gone to great lengths to try to bring the warring parties together and forge an end to this conflict. The United States continues to support these efforts. The path ahead is clear. Violence will not bring about a solution. The South Sudanese parties must establish immediately a transitional government that can serve with legitimacy and represent the needs of the people of South Sudan.\nBefore independence, when the war was at its height, I visited with people across the country. In Marial Bai, in Rumbek, in Lui—I heard people describe how war was devastating their lives and tearing their families apart. Ordinary people had endured years of suffering and uncertainty, but they still strove to forge a brighter future for their children. That is the choice the leaders of South Sudan must make now. The United States will not abandon the people of South Sudan and their right to live freely and at peace in their own country. We will continue to stand with all those who dream of a better tomorrow. The United States will continue to work hard to help you to achieve lasting peace and justice. We will hold accountable those who abuse the people of South Sudan. And, the United States along with the international community, will punish those determined to drive South Sudan into the abyss.\nMay God Bless your young country and the people of South Sudan.", "timestamp": "2016-07-09", "title": "Press Release - Statement by National Security Advisor Susan E.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118061", "text": "The United States strongly supports NATO's cooperation with partners as a means to more effectively share burdens and further our common security goals. This aligns with wider U.S. strategy of driving global cooperation on security challenges through networks of alliances and building local nation partnerships across the globe. The Partnership for Peace (PfP), established in 1994, includes 22 European partners; the Mediterranean Dialogue (Med-D), also established in 1994, includes Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia; and the Istanbul Cooperative Initiative (ICI), established in 2004, includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and UAE. NATO's Partners Across the Globe (PAG) initiative includes Afghanistan, Australia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, and Pakistan. Australia, Finland, Georgia, Jordan, and Sweden have been designated Enhanced Opportunities Partners in recognition of their exceptional interoperability and contributions to NATO operations.\nAt their inception, NATO's partnership programs sought to reform defense sectors in the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, and prepare them for NATO membership. NATO partnerships have more recently focused on interoperability and facilitating contributions to NATO operations, although political engagement and mentorship in security sector reforms continue to feature prominently. NATO tailors its approach to the individual goals of its partner nations.\nFrom a defense standpoint, U.S. bilateral support to NATO Partners typically falls into three categories: (1) direct security assistance; (2) training and exercises; and (3) long-term reform of defense and security institutions. We have actively engaged in each of these areas for Ukraine, and we are intensifying support for Georgia and Moldova.\nUkraine\nU.S. Assistance:\nThe U.S.-Ukraine defense relationship is transitioning from \"crisis-response\" to an enduring partnership aimed at developing more capable, NATO-interoperable Ukrainian Armed Forces. This partnership will help Ukraine effectively preserve and enforce its territorial integrity, deepen defense institutional reforms, and improve processes for developing defense requirements and managing resources.\nThe United States announced a comprehensive $335 million FY16 bilateral security assistance package for Ukraine, bringing total committed U.S. security assistance to more than $600 million since 2014. The FY16 package includes bilateral support in three main areas:\n*  Training: 350 U.S. personnel training up to five battalions of Ukrainian conventional forces and one battalion of special operations forces, while developing a long-term institutional training capacity.\n*  Equipment: including counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, secure communications, training aids, logistics infrastructure and IT systems, tactical UAVs, and medical equipment.\n*  Advisors: advancing implementation of key defense reforms, such as promoting civilian oversight, greater efficiency and transparency, and combatting corruption.\nThe Multinational Joint Commission on Defense Reform and Security Cooperation with Ukraine (MJC), led by the United States in partnership with Canada, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, assesses Ukrainian requirements and prioritizes training, equipment, and advisory initiatives.\nThe United States and Ukraine also host two exercises each year in Ukraine - a ground forces peacekeeping exercise (RAPID TRIDENT) and a naval exercise (SEA BREEZE) in the Black Sea. These exercises seek to enhance interoperability and strengthen regional security through realistic training, while also sending an important signal of reassurance to Ukraine and other regional partners. Ukraine also participates in other U.S.-hosted exercises elsewhere in Europe.\nNATO Assistance:\nComprehensive Assistance Package: Allies will endorse a Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) at the Warsaw Summit that will streamline and enhance NATO's ongoing support for Ukraine in the following areas:\n• Advisory support: Resident and non-resident NATO and allied advisors are assisting Ukraine in a broad range of defense issues, including logistics and strategic-level reform.\n• Defense reform: Key assistance includes capacity and institution building, professional development of civilian employees, and strategic communications.\n• Defense education: Allied experts are cooperating with eight defense education institutions, three training centers, and the Diplomatic Academy in Ukraine to improve staff skills and develop curricula that meet Western standards.\n• Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and demining: NATO is conducting humanitarian demining operations and will implement a project to increase Ukraine's capabilities to counter IEDs.\n• Explosive ordnance disposal: Allies are supporting Ukraine in disposing of obsolete small arms/light weapons, ammunition, and anti-personnel mines.\nTrust Funds: As a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, allied leaders at the 2014 Wales Summit established five Trust Funds to support Ukraine.\n• Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4)\n• Logistics and Standardization\n• Cyber Defense\n• Military Career Transition\n• Medical Rehabilitation\n• Counter-IED (established subsequent to the Wales Summit)\nGeorgia\nU.S. Assistance:\nThe United States has enhanced bilateral security assistance to Georgia to increase the defense capacity and NATO interoperability of its forces. In FY15, the United States committed an additional $20 million in Foreign Military Financing through the European Reassurance Initiative, bringing Georgia's security assistance up to $30 million. Security assistance to Georgia remains high in FY16, and is projected to remain so in FY17.\nThis assistance will further Georgia's goals of professionalizing and modernizing the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces, promote NATO interoperability, enable Georgia to continue to deploy its forces to Afghanistan, and support the development and enhancement of training and education facilities. Georgia participates in nine U.S.-sponsored exercises annually. Notably, the United States and other allies have conducted Exercise NOBLE PARTNER in Georgia over the last two years in an effort to confirm the interoperability and readiness of Georgian land forces contributing to the NATO Response Force. The United States continues to support the Georgian Ministry of Defense in its efforts to develop a modern, effective and transparent force. We have active defense institution building programs focused on human resources management, acquisition and procurement, and program budgeting. The United States also has an embedded Ministry of Defense Advisor focused on military medical support.\nNATO Assistance:\nSubstantial NATO-Georgia Package: Allies endorsed the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package (SNGP) at the Wales Summit in September 2014 with to strengthen Georgia's defense capabilities and help Georgia advance its preparation for membership in the Alliance. The SNGP built upon NATO's already extensive cooperation through the Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP), Building Integrity Program (BI), and Professional Development Program (PDP) by initiating new lines of effort that include:\n• NATO Core Team and NATO Liaison Office (NLO): The United States provides seconded personnel in support of both of these institutions, which offer strategic level advice on defense issues. Americans fill the position of Deputy Core Team Lead and lead officer for the NLO.\n• Advisory support: Both resident and non-resident NATO experts provide advice across a range of defense issues to advance the capacity and interoperability of Georgia's Armed Forces. Areas of support include acquisition, strategic and operational planning, military police, and strategic communications.\n• Periodic exercises: Allies support and contribute to NATO exercises open to partners and held in Georgia on a regular basis. The United States linked exercise AGILE SPIRIT 2015 to NATO, and NATO will conduct a computer assisted exercise in Georgia in November 2016.\n• Joint Training and Evaluation Center (JTEC): Established in 2015, the JTEC will provide training, evaluation, and certification opportunities to enhance interoperability and operational readiness.\n• Logistics facility: NATO is assisting in establishing a Georgian logistics capability that will facilitate participation of allied and partner nations in exercises and disaster relief operations, and will provide support for cargo and personnel engaged in NATO-led operations. We lead this portion of the SNGP.\n• Defense Institution Building School: Building upon its experience through DEEP, BI, and PDP, allies are working with Georgia to establish a center that will provide classroom and on-the-job training for Georgian government personnel.\nFurther Practical Cooperation under the SNGP: At the Warsaw Summit, allies will agree to enhance and deepen cooperation with Georgia across a range of efforts, and to increase high-level political dialogue with Georgia.\nMoldova\nU.S. Assistance:\nThe United States has increased security assistance to Moldova to promote stability, professionalize and modernize its forces to promote NATO interoperability, reform its defense institutions, and facilitate Moldova's participation in NATO operations such as in Kosovo. This assistance also provides Moldova with training and equipment for secure communications, mobility, and medical support. In FY15, the United States increased Foreign Military Financing funds through the European Reassurance Initiative by nearly $10 million to a total of $11.25 million. The United States will continue to prioritize security assistance support for Moldova in FY16 and FY17.\nNATO Assistance:\nAllies agreed to develop a phased Defense and Related Security Capacity Building (DCB) package for Moldova in June 2015. The United States leads Phase I, which is offering advice and assistance by a team of NATO defense reform experts to develop a new National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and National Military Strategy. Moldova completed its new National Security Strategy in June, and intends to complete its National Defense Strategy by the end of 2016, and the National Military Strategy in 2017. Phase II will provide assistance and advice in developing Moldova's land and air forces, command and control, training doctrine and infrastructure, cyber defenses, and military education, and will also assist in fighting corruption.\nEfforts to assist other partners:\nIn addition to robust support to Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, allies provide support to a number of Middle East and North African countries, including but not limited to Iraq, Jordan, and Tunisia. In July 2015, NATO approved a DCB package for Iraq to enhance its defense capacities, reform its security sector, and increase its ability to contribute to regional security. Training in C-IED, military medicine, and civilian-military planning is occurring in Amman, Jordan. NATO is exploring how it can re-locate some of this training into Iraq, and broaden the activities, which may include logistics, border security, and police training. The United States currently works on defense institution building to support the long-term development of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense and its forces. Areas of support include strategy, policy and planning, and human resources management. The United States is also providing subject matter experts to NATO to support their line of effort focused on force structure analysis.\nNATO's cooperation with Jordan is substantial, and the Planning and Review Process is the primary instrument for practical military cooperation. Jordan has earned Enhanced Opportunities Partner status and participates in the Operational Capability Concept Evaluation and Feedback program with two battalions. Allies agreed a DCB package in November 2014 to provide Jordan with focused assistance in seven areas drawn from its consultations with NATO. Jordan continues to host, with the United States, the annual EAGLE LION exercise aimed at promoting cooperation and interoperability, building functional capacity, practicing crisis management and enhancing readiness. In 2015, Jordan also participated in: the EAGLE RESOLVE multilateral exercise in Kuwait; the Joint Forces Command Naples Regional Exercise (REGEX 15) in Greece; the TRIDENT JOUST command post and computer-assisted exercise; the Naples Journey battle staff training; and the TRIDENT JUNCTURE command post and live exercise. In 2016, Jordan will participate in the TRIDENT JUNCTURE and REGEX 16, and has agreed to host the JFC Naples REGEX 17 on its territory. We are also committed to institutional level support for the Jordan Armed Forces (JAF). Following a defense institution building (DIB) scoping trip in February, the United States and the JAF identified additional areas for U.S. support to include assistance in the JAF Strategic Defense Review (SDR) process, support to personnel issues such as recruiting and human resources planning, and logistics.\nSince it joined the Mediterranean Dialogue (Med D) in 1994, Tunisia has participated actively in Ministerial meetings, political consultations, and meetings of the North Atlantic Council as well as in the training activities, conferences, and fora organized by the Alliance. In 2010, Tunisia took its first steps to define areas for cooperation with NATO, and in 2014 it first signed an Individual Partnership Cooperation Program (IPCP), reflecting new areas for practical cooperation including intelligence exchange, counter-terrorism, cyber defense, and border control. In 2016, Tunisia begins its first round of participation in its own Planning and Review Process, which is intended to assist in modernizing its national defense system, develop its operational capabilities and NATO interoperability, and promote defense transparency. Since the \"Jasmine Revolution\" in 2011, the United States has committed over $225 million in bilateral security sector assistance focused on enhancing Tunisia's capacity to counter internal and regional threats from terrorism through the provision of equipment and training, to include surveillance aircraft, ground relay systems, and critical support to their rotary wing assets. Additionally, the United States is collaborating with Tunisia on a program that will better enable it to secure its borders.", "timestamp": "2016-07-09", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. and NATO Efforts in Support of NATO Partners, including Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118073", "text": "At the NATO Warsaw Summit, heads of state and government will commit their nations and the Alliance to enhance resilience against the full spectrum of threats, including hybrid threats wherever they might originate. As leaders will affirm, resilience against these challenges requires allies' civilian and military capabilities, and work across both public and private sectors as well as with international bodies.\nTo further these goals, the United States is providing over $200 million in security assistance and has provided military equipment to help allies increase their national defense capacity, improve NATO interoperability, and reduce dependence on Russian military equipment. U.S. military and civilian assistance is augmenting allied efforts - nationally and through NATO - to deter, defend, and recover quickly from hybrid, cyber, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear (CBRN), or conventional armed attack. U.S. bilateral and multilateral contributions are designed to assist Allies who are already working to strengthen their own national resilience in line with their obligations under Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.\nBroad U.S. Government Support for Resilience\nU.S. activities span several areas that will also be outlined in the allied leaders' resilience commitment:\nMilitary Capabilities: U.S. assistance has helped allies improve the capacity for intelligence-based defensive operations, as well as provided better capabilities in the areas of command and control; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); anti-tank; air defense; communications; maritime security; and ground-supported air-attack. Along with NATO, we have enhanced allied ability to deploy and receive forces in support of collective defense operations. With other NATO allies, we have sought to mitigate the dependency of allies on Russian-origin legacy military equipment.\nCivil Preparedness: The United States maintains a cadre of 50 deployable civil emergency experts that can assist in host nation capacity building for allies. This is part of a larger pool that can form advisory support teams to assist national governments in identifying resilience improvements or rapid reaction teams to respond in crises. We are also doubling our emergency management advisors at NATO to support civil preparedness efforts. More broadly, the United States has civil-emergency response capabilities across government and private sectors with extensive potential to help address crisis situations abroad if needed.\nCyber Defense: The U.S. government is promoting strong national cyber defense capabilities to help allies protect critical networks and infrastructure. U.S. activities include providing trainers, onsite expertise, and sharing best practices. These efforts improve allies' ability to identify, monitor, assess, and attribute cyber threats. We engage and assist allies on a bilateral basis, as well as within NATO and at the NATO Center of Excellence for Cyber Defense in Estonia.\nCBRN Defense: We also support allies' resilience against risks or threats involving CBRN materials through bilateral consultations and assistance, as well as at NATO, and with allies at the NATO CBRN Center of Excellence in the Czech Republic.\nFocused Resilience Support - The Baltic States and Poland\nThe United States is providing specialized forms of assistance to our Baltic allies and Poland to increase their national capacity in support of enhanced resilience. U.S. security assistance complements steps that Baltic and Polish allies are taking to strengthen their own national defenses by supplementing their investments. Among other initiatives, the United States has focused on providing equipment and training for anti-tank capabilities; air defense; ISR systems; and ground-supported air operations equipment and training. These capabilities help ensure the Baltic States and Poland are interoperable in support of deterrence and defense. Non-military activities include assistance to strengthen the capabilities of Baltic state border security authorities and to support independent investigative media.\nWider Support to Counter Transnational Threats\nThe United States is supporting allied efforts and encouraging greater NATO-EU cooperation to address transnational challenges such as weapons smuggling and terrorism. We are working closely with allies to improve our information sharing capabilities, which are key to identifying, tracking, and disrupting terrorist and other transnational threats. Other U.S. support to allies includes: operational and training capabilities to enhance Turkey's border security and mitigate the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters; joint training and exercises to enhance French, UK, and U.S. capabilities to respond to improvised radiological or nuclear threats; equipment to enhance Greece's maritime security forces; equipment upgrades for Bulgarian CT operations; enhancing Albania's CT operations analysis capabilities; training center support for Romanian forces; and equipment upgrades for Czech and Hungarian Special Forces.", "timestamp": "2016-07-09", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. Contributions to Enhancing Allied Resilience"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118074", "text": "NATO's mission in Afghanistan has been the Alliance's largest and one of its longest-running military operations, with 50 coalition countries contributing a peak of 140,000 troops over a nearly 15-year campaign. On January 1, 2015, NATO successfully transitioned from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission to the non-combat Resolute Support mission, and the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) assumed full responsibility for Afghanistan's security nationwide. At the Warsaw Summit, NATO Heads of State and Government committed to provide financial support to the ANDSF through the end of 2020 and to sustain the Resolute Support mission beyond 2016 using a flexible, regional approach. These commitments send a clear message that the international community continues to stand with the Afghan people. The United States, together with NATO Allies and partners, also reaffirmed our belief that an Afghan-led and owned peace and reconciliation process is the only pathway to a sustainable resolution of the conflict.\nSustaining the Resolute Support Mission Beyond 2016\nThirty-nine NATO Allies and partners have thus far committed more than 11,000 troops to sustain the Resolute Support mission beyond 2016. The mission will continue in a flexible, regional approach, in Kabul and Bagram and at the existing coalition bases in Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat, and Mazar-e-Sharif. Resolute Support will continue to focus on security ministries and institutional development, plus train-advise-assist efforts with conventional Afghan forces at the Corps level and Afghan special operations forces and Air Force at the tactical level. Four Allied nations have agreed to continue serving as \"framework nations\" - Germany will lead in the north, Italy in the west, Turkey in the capital, and the United States in the east and south. Detailed military planning for the post-2016 NATO mission is ongoing and will be adjusted based on final national troop pledges expected in the coming months.\nThe President announced on July 6 that - based on the recommendations of Secretary Carter, Chairman Dunford, and his commanders on the ground - the United States will maintain approximately 8,400 troops in Afghanistan beyond 2016. This revised U.S. force posture will preserve the core security cooperation efforts and counterterrorism platforms that were central to the President's post-2016 plan, but retain additional capabilities to train, advise, and assist conventional ANDSF and allow for more robust enabler support to the coalition. U.S. troops will continue to pursue two narrow missions: First, the United States will maintain a counterterrorism capability in Afghanistan to target the remnants of al Qaida, ISIL-K, and other terrorist groups in the region. Second, the United States will support NATO train, advise, and assist efforts with the ANDSF. The United States currently contributes more than 6,900 troops of the total 12,800 coalition forces dedicated to the Resolute Support Mission, and will continue to provide robust support for the NATO mission in the future.\nNATO's training and advisory efforts have produced tangible, positive results. Since assuming full responsibility for security, the ANDSF have demonstrated commitment and resilience against a persistent insurgency. The ANDSF's performance in 2016 has improved over the previous year, showing their capacity to adapt and progress. This year, Afghan forces have repelled numerous attacks, retaken Taliban-held territory in Kunduz, Baghlan, and Uruzgan provinces, and demonstrated greater effectiveness in providing their own combat enablers, including close air support. The Afghan government controls all major population centers and key transportation lines. Moreover, Afghan leaders have demonstrated a willingness to implement difficult but necessary reforms, such as developing a Sustainable Security Strategy that better allocates ANDSF resources to defend strategic terrain, and better implementing rest and refit plans for Afghan troops in the field. While there is no question Afghan forces have become more capable and professional, they are not yet self-sustaining. Beyond 2016, the Resolute Support mission will be carefully tailored to focus on those critical Afghan capabilities that are slower to develop, such as intelligence, logistics, aviation, and command and control.\nFinancial Sustainment of the ANDSF\nAt the Warsaw Summit, NATO Allies and partners committed to extend financial commitments made at the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago. Some 30 nations have renewed pledges to sustain the Afghan security forces through 2020 at or near current levels. Thus far, the international community has pledged more than $800 million annually for 2018-2020, and the United States has requested $3.45 billion in our 2017 budget. President Obama also pledged that he will recommend to his successor that the United States continue to seek funding for the ANDSF at or near current levels through 2020. These funding commitments will allow the ANDSF to maintain its authorized force level of 352,000 personnel through 2020, while the Afghan government, the United States, and the international community implement cost reduction measures to decrease ANDSF costs.\nThe United States also joined NATO Allies and partners in recognizing the Afghan government for doing its part and contributing $421 million to sustain the ANDSF last year, and for committing to increase its contribution as the Afghan economy and revenues grow. The United States supports President Ghani's efforts to root out corruption by adopting anti-money laundering regulations, working to recover Kabul Bank assets, and halting illegal procurements in the Ministries of Interior and Defense. While much work still needs to be done, such as electoral reform, the Afghan government has now appointed nearly all cabinet ministers, provincial governors, and chief security positions. President Obama also acknowledged the cooperation of President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah as they have worked over the past two years for the sake of their country and demonstrated their commitment to reforms that will strengthen their country and decrease the need for international support.", "timestamp": "2016-07-09", "title": "Fact Sheet: NATO's Enduring Commitment to Afghanistan"}

Good evening, everybody. Once again, I want to thank the Government and the people of Poland for hosting this NATO summit. And I especially want to thank the people of Warsaw for their wonderful hospitality. It is my third visit to Poland. Each time, we have been received with tremendous friendship, and it signifies the close bonds between our two countries.\nShooting of Law Enforcement Officers in Dallas, TX\nI want to begin this press conference with events back home. This has been a tough week, first and foremost, for the families [of those; White House correction.] who have been killed, but also for the entire American family. In my call yesterday to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, I stressed that the Justice Department and our Federal Government should continue to do everything that we can to assist the investigation in Dallas and to support the police and the city of Dallas as they deal with this tragedy.\nIn my call to Chief Brown, I commended him for showing outstanding leadership during an extremely challenging time and asked him to convey to all the officers and their families how the American people are grieving with them and that we stand with them.\nI'll have the opportunity to convey our condolences and show our solidarity when I visit Dallas in a few days. But before I do, let me just make some very brief points. First of all, as painful as this week has been, I firmly believe that America is not as divided as some have suggested. Americans of all races and all backgrounds are rightly outraged by the inexcusable attacks on police, whether it's in Dallas or anyplace else.\nThat includes protestors. It includes family members who have grave concerns about police conduct, and they have said that this is unacceptable. There's no division there. And Americans of all races and all backgrounds are also rightly saddened and angered about the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and about the larger, persistent problem of African Americans and Latinos being treated differently in our criminal justice system.\nSo there is sorrow, there is anger, there is confusion about next steps. But there's unity in recognizing that this is not how we want our communities to operate. This is not who we want to be as Americans. And that serves as the basis for us being able to move forward in a constructive and positive way.\nSo we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us. The demented individual who carried out those attacks in Dallas, he's no more representative of African Americans than the shooter in Charleston was representative of White Americans or the shooter in Orlando or San Bernardino were representative of Muslim Americans. They don't speak for us. That's not who we are.\nAnd one of the things that gives me hope this week is actually seeing how the overwhelming majority of Americans have reacted: with empathy and understanding. We've seen police continue to reach out to communities that they serve all across the country and show incredible professionalism as they're protecting protestors. We've seen activists and grassroots groups who have expressed concern about police shootings, but are also adamant in their support of the Dallas Police Department, which is particularly appropriate because the Dallas Police Department is a great example of a department that has taken the issue of police shootings seriously and has engaged in an approach that has not only brought down their murder rates, but also drastically reduced complaints around police misconduct.\nThat's the spirit that we all need to embrace. That's the spirit that I want to build on. It's one of the reasons why next week, using the Task Force that we had set up after Ferguson, but also building on it, and inviting both police and law enforcement and community activists and civil rights leaders, bringing them together to the White House. I want to start moving on constructive actions that are actually going to make a difference, because that is what all Americans want.\nSo when we start suggesting that somehow there's this enormous polarization and we're back to the situation in the sixties, that's just not true. You're not seeing riots, and you're not seeing police going after people who are protesting peacefully. You've seen almost uniformly peaceful protests. And you've seen, uniformly, police handling those protests with professionalism.\nAnd so, as tough, as hard, as depressing as the loss of life was this week, we've got a foundation to build on. We just have to have confidence that we can build on those better angels of our nature. And we have to make sure that all of us step back, do some reflection, and make sure that the rhetoric that we engage in is constructive and not destructive; that we're not painting anybody with an overly broad brush; that we're not constantly thinking the worst in other people rather than the best. If we do that, then I'm confident that we will continue to make progress.\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\nNow, here in Europe, this is a pivotal moment for our alliance. In the nearly 70 years of NATO, perhaps never have we faced such a range of challenges all at once: security, humanitarian, political. NATO nations—the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, and Turkey—have endured heinous terrorist attacks directed or inspired by ISIL. Russia has violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent European nation—Ukraine—and engaged in provocative behavior toward NATO allies. European borders and economies have been tested by millions of migrants fleeing conflicts and depravation. And the vote in the United Kingdom to leave the EU has raised questions about the future of European integration.\nIn this challenging moment, I want to take this opportunity to state clearly what will never change, and that is the unwavering commitment of the United States to the security and defense of Europe, to our transatlantic relationship, to our commitment to our common defense.\nAnd next year will mark the hundredth anniversary of the first American troops arriving on European soil in the First World War. And ever since, through two world wars, a long cold war, and the decades since, generations of Americans have served here for our common security. In quiet cemeteries, from France to the Netherlands to Italy, Americans still rest where they fell. Even now more than 60,000 American military personnel serve in dozens of European countries. And my point is this: In good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United States—always.\nNow, here in Warsaw, we haven't simply reaffirmed our enduring article 5 obligations to our common security; we're moving forward with the most significant reinforcement of our collective defense any time since the cold war. First, we're strengthening NATO's defense and deterrence posture. Building on our European Reassurance Initiative—which has already increased readiness, from the Baltics to the Black Sea—our alliance will enhance our forward presence on our eastern flank.\nAs I announced yesterday, the United States will be the lead nation here in Poland, deploying a battalion of American soldiers. The United Kingdom will take the lead in Estonia, Germany in Lithuania, and Canada in Latvia. This will mean some 4,000 additional NATO troops, on a rotational basis, in this region. Moreover, the additional U.S. armored brigade will rotate through Europe, including an additional 4,000 U.S. troops. Meanwhile, to the south, we agreed on new deterrence measures in Romania and Bulgaria. So NATO is sending a clear message that we will defend every ally.\nWe're also strengthening the readiness of our forces against a range of threats. So NATO's Joint Task Force is now operational and can deploy anywhere in Europe on short notice. With recent progress here in Poland, Romania, and Spain, NATO's ballistic missile defense is coming on line. And we're launching a new effort to boost the resilience of allies to better defend against new types of threats, including cyberattacks.\nNATO is increasing our support to Ukraine. At our meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, we agreed on a new assistance package to improve alliance support for Ukrainian forces. Prime Minister Cameron, President Hollande, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Renzi, and I met with President Poroshenko, and we reaffirmed our strong support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the need to continue political and economic reforms.\n[At this point, applause was heard from another room.]\nThe President. Thank you. I'm already getting applause. [Laughter] I'm not even finished yet. [Laughter]\nAnd even as the NATO-Russia Council will meet in Brussels next week, our 28 nations are united in our view that there can be no business as usual with Russia until it fully implements its Minsk obligations.\nNATO will do more also to fight against terrorist networks. Every ally already contributes to the campaign against ISIL. Now, the alliance will contribute AWACS aircraft to improve our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance against ISIL. NATO training of Iraqi security forces, currently run in Jordan, will move to Iraq, where they can be even more effective. And building on my decision to largely maintain the current U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan into next year, 39 nations, including the U.S., have committed more than 12,000 troops to NATO's training mission. And in addition, some 30 nations have pledged upwards of $900 million to help sustain Afghan forces, which is a very strong message of our enduring commitment to Afghanistan.\nWe're bolstering our efforts on NATO's southern flank. The alliance will increase our support to EU naval operations in the Mediterranean to stop arms traffickers and go after criminals that are exploiting desperate migrants. And we're going to do more to help partners from North Africa to the Middle East to Georgia strengthen their own defense capacity.\nAnd finally, after many years, NATO has stopped the collective decline in defense spending. Over the past 2 years, most NATO members have halted cuts and begun investing more in defense. And this means defense spending across the alliance is now scheduled to increase. I especially want to commend our friends in the U.K., Poland, Greece, Estonia—all who, along with the United States, pay their full share of at least 2 percent of GDP for our collective defense. But for those of you doing the math, that means that the majority of allies are still not hitting that 2 percent mark, an obligation we agreed to in Wales. So we had a very candid conversation about this. There's a recognition that given the range of threats that we face and the capabilities that we need, everybody has got to step up, and everybody has got to do better.\nSo, in closing, I'd just note that this is my final NATO summit. Throughout my time in office, one of my top foreign policy priorities has been to strengthen our alliances, especially with NATO. And as I reflect on the past 8 years—both the progress and the challenges—I can say with confidence that we've delivered on that promise. The United States has increased our presence here in Europe. NATO is as strong, as nimble, and as ready as ever. And as we see from the presence of Montenegro at this summit, the door to NATO membership remains open to nations that can meet our high standards.\nSo nobody should ever doubt the resolve of this alliance to stay united and focused on the future. And just as our nations have stood together over the past hundred years, I know that we'll stay united and grow even stronger for another hundred more.\nAnd with that, let me take some questions. I'm going to start with Kathleen Hennessey of AP.\nShooting of Law Enforcement Officers in Dallas, TX/Gun Control\nQ. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to specifically ask about the Dallas shooting and the attacker there. Now that we know more about the man who, we believe, did those crimes, I'm wondering if you could help us understand how you describe his motives. Do you consider this an act of domestic terrorism? Was this a hate crime? Was this a mentally ill man with a gun? How should Americans understand why that happened? And then, also, on the issue of political division and looking for solutions, there have been some critics who noted that you immediately mentioned your call for gun control soon after the attacks. Do you think that in any way encourages or ensures that people retreat to their corners as they think about this?\nThe President. Yes. First of all, I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter. As we've seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled. By definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you—strangers—you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I'll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents.\nWhat I can say is that although he may have used as an excuse his anger about previous incidents—as has been indicated, at least, in the press, and as Chief Brown, I think, indicated—in no way does that represent what the overwhelming majority of Americans think.\nAmericans, to a large degree, want to make sure that we have a police force that is supported, because they know our police officers do a really tough, dangerous job. And witness the professionalism of our Dallas police officers. As they were being shot at, the fact that they helped to clear the area, they helped to get the fallen and the injured out of there, they were able to isolate the suspect, and that you didn't have other casualties as a consequence of the police shooting back—that just gives you an indication of what a tough job they have and how well they do it on a regular basis.\nSo I think the danger, as I said, is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country. It doesn't. When some White kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshippers who invite him to worship with them, we don't assume that somehow he's making a political statement that's relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn't make those assumptions around a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way.\nNow, with respect to the issue of guns, I am going to keep on talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight; we are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people; but we can make it harder for them to do so.\nAnd if you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we've experienced over the course of the last year or the last 5 years or the last 10 years—I've said this before—we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence that we experience. And I'm not just talking about mass shootings. I'm talking about the hundreds of people who have already been shot this year in my hometown of Chicago, the ones that we just consider routine.\nNow, we may not see that issue as connected to what happened in Dallas, but part of what's creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere. And as I said before, they have a right to come home, and now they have very little margin of error in terms of making decisions. So if you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can't set aside the gun issue and pretend that that's irrelevant.\nAt the protest in Dallas, one of the challenges for the Dallas Police Department—as they're being shot at—is because this is an open-carry State, there are a bunch of people participating in the protest who have weapons on them. Imagine if you're a police officer and you're trying to sort out who is shooting at you and there are a bunch of people who have got guns on them.\nIn Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused in some fashion those tragic events.\nSo, no, we can't just ignore that and pretend that that's somehow political or the President is pushing his policy agenda. It is a contributing factor—not the sole factor, but a contributing factor—to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. And so we have to talk about that.\nAnd as I've said before, there is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is, even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization.\nAnd you're right, when it comes to the issue of gun safety, there is polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who actually think that we could be doing better when it comes to gun safety. But that expresses itself in stark terms when it comes to legislation in Congress or in State legislatures. And that's too bad. We're going to have to tackle that at some point. And I'm not going to stop talking about it, because if we don't talk about it, we're not going to solve these underlying problems. It's part of the problem.\nCarol Lee [Wall Street Journal].\nTerrorism/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/U.S. Crime Rates/Criminal Justice Reform\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned San Bernardino and Orlando. And Americans have been warned that similar attacks could happen here in the United, in the—over there in the United States. And obviously, what happened this week in Minnesota and Louisiana and Dallas—these are not necessarily the same types of attacks and the motivations may be different, but collectively, they're having a real impact on the American public in that there's a real anxiety out there, where people are genuinely afraid, going about their daily lives, doing routine things.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. So my questions are, do you see any sort of common thread in these events? Is this sort of a—just a new normal? Is there anything that you can do about this? And what's your message to Americans who are genuinely afraid? Because the anxiety just seems to be getting worse, not better, and these attacks keep seeming to happen in much more regularity that wasn't a part of their experience even, say, a year ago.\nThe President. Well, Carol Lee, I do think we have to disentangle these issues. When it comes to terrorist attacks, people are understandably concerned not just because of what's happening in the United States, but what happened in Brussels and what's happened in Paris and what's happened in Turkey and what is consistently happening in Iraq and Bangladesh and all around the world. And that's why the work that we've done with NATO and our counter-ISIL coalition and other partners is so vital.\nOne of the things that's been commented on is that as ISIL loses territory and the fraud of the caliphate becomes more obvious, they are going to start resorting to more traditional terrorist tactics. They can't govern. They can't deliver anything meaningful to the people whose territory they can control. The one thing they know how to do is kill.\nAnd so, we're going to have to redouble our efforts in terms of intelligence, coordination, our countermessaging on extremism; working closely with Muslim communities, both overseas and in our own countries, to make sure that we are reducing the number of people who are inspired by their message or are, in some coordinated fashion, trying to attack us.\nAnd obviously, we have built up a huge infrastructure to try to do that. The more successful we are in Iraq and Syria and Libya and other places where ISIL has gotten a stronghold, the weaker they are, the less resources they have, the less effectively they can recruit. But when individuals are willing to die, and they have no conscience and compunction about killing innocent people, they are hard to detect. And it means that we've got to continually up our game.\nHaving said that, I think it is important to note just the success that we've seen in the last several weeks when it comes to rolling back Al Qaida. The liberation of Fallujah got a little bit lost in the news, but that's a big town, and with our support, the counter-ISIL coalition support, the Iraqi Government was able to move through there quickly. They're now positioning themselves so that they can start going after Mosul. In Syria, you're seeing progress along a pocket, Manbij, that has been used for foreign fighter flows. And so they're on their heels, and we're going to stay on it.\nNow, when it comes to crime, generally, I think it's just important to keep in mind that our crime rate today is substantially lower than it was 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. I mean, over the last 4 or 5 years, during the course of my Presidency, violent crime in the United States is the lowest it's been since probably the 1960s, maybe before the early 1960s. There's been an incredible drop in violent crime.\nSo that doesn't lessen, I think, people's understandable fears if they see a video clip of somebody getting killed. But it is important to keep in perspective that in places like New York, or Los Angeles or Dallas, you've seen huge drops in the murder rates. And that's a testimony to smarter policing, and there are a range of other factors that have contributed to that.\nSo that should not—we should never be satisfied when any innocent person is being killed, but that should not be something that is driving our anxieties, relative to where we've been in the past.\nAnd with respect to, finally, the issue of police shootings, there's no doubt that the visual records that we're seeing have elevated people's consciousness about this. But as I've said before, for African Americans or Latinos in the presmartphone age, I don't think that people were not aware of the fact that there is evidence of racial bias in our criminal justice system. It's been well documented, and it's been experienced. And even before I got to the U.S. Senate, when I was in the State Senate in Illinois, I passed legislation to try to reduce the incidents of racial profiling by collecting data. And that was prompted by evidence that it was taking place in certain parts of the State.\nAnd the fact that we're aware of it may increase some anxiety right now and hurt and anger. But it's been said, sunshine is the best disinfectant. By seeing it, by people feeling a sense of urgency about it, by the larger American community realizing that, gosh, maybe this is a problem—and we've seen even some very conservative commentators begin to acknowledge this is something maybe we need to work on—that promises the possibility of actually getting it done. So it hurts, but if we don't diagnose this, we can't fix it.\nAyesha Rascoe, Reuters.\nU.S. Race Relations\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. As you come to the end of your term, there's a lot of talk about your legacy. I know you may like to leave that to the historians, but——\nThe President. I do. [Laughter]\nQ. ——but when you look back on your Presidency and consider race relations, what do you hope your legacy will be? How do you think the shootings in Dallas and the high-profile shootings by police and other events will shape the way your Presidency is remembered?\nThe President. I do want to leave legacy questions to the history books. But what I can do—maybe this is a fair response to your question—is to say how I've tried to lead the country on this issue.\nMore than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race; to encourage people to listen to each other; to recognize that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn't suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama; that things have gotten better—substantially better—but that we've still got a lot more work to do; and that, as was the case with the police Task Force that we set up, that I've tried to encourage people to come up with practical, concrete solutions that can reduce, if not eliminate, the problems of racial bias.\nAnd if my voice has been true and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away, but it surfaces problems, it frames them; it allows us to wrestle with these issues and try to come up with practical solutions; and that that perspective may lead to continued improvement so that not just Malia and Sasha, but their children can experience a country that is more just and more united and more equal.\nAnd that's not going to happen right away, and that's okay. We plant seeds, and somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted. And I'd like to think that, as best as I could, I have been true in speaking about these issues.\nJustin Sink [Bloomberg News].\nUnited Kingdom's Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/Economic Globalization/Immigration/Refugee Crisis in Europe\nQ. Thanks, Mr. President. Throughout the summit, EU leaders have echoed your confidence about Brexit happening in an orderly way. But they've also stressed that the U.K. has—to have access to an open market, must continue to respect the freedom of migration for workers. Someone who has repeatedly advocated for globalization and extolled the virtues of immigration, shouldn't that principle be prebaked in the negotiations? What specific assurances did you get during the summit from other leaders that make you confident that currency markets are wrong and the political turmoil in Britain and subsequent effort to leave the EU will go smoothly?\nAnd finally, both you and Secretary Kerry have used \"if\" to describe Brexit. So I'm wondering if you see any way for the British people to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue.\nThe President. Okay. I think we have to assume that a referendum having been passed, with a lot of attention, a lengthy campaign, and relatively high participation rates, is going to stick, and that the incoming Government, a conservative Government, is going to invoke article 50 and begin the process of negotiations. How that process unfolds, how the negotiations work, I think, is going to be up to the parties involved.\nThe main message I've had here is, we are close friends, allies, commercial partners with the U.K. and with the EU. We will remain close friends, allies, partners, continue to have strong relationships on both sides of the Channel. Our primary interest is to make sure that the negotiations and this process are as orderly and as sensible as possible, recognizing that it is in the interests of both sides to get it right.\nThey are major trading partners. That's where goods get sent, back and forth. And it's important that neither side harden positions in ways that ultimately do damage to their respective economies and ultimately to the world economy at a time when our world economy is still pretty wobbly in places.\nI want to make a further point. I'm not sure it's accurate to say that I am a huge booster of globalization. What is accurate to say is that I believe the process of globalization is here to stay, as a consequence of technology and the mobility of capital and cargo container ships and global supply chains. And conceivably, we could run back the tape to 50 years ago and see whether we could rearrange some of that process, but it's happening. It's here. And we see it every day in our lives. Everybody who has got a smartphone in their pocket is seeing it.\nAnd my argument has been that there are enormous benefits to be gained from that global integration, just as there are enormous benefits to be gained from European integration, so long as we recognize that with that integration there is the danger of increased inequality, of workers having less leverage and capital having more leverage, that it threatens to leave people behind.\nAnd if we don't take steps to make sure everybody can participate in that global integration—making sure that wages are high enough, making sure that we rebuild the social compact so that pensions and health care are taken care of, making sure that communities are not completely abandoned when a factory leaves and there's an economic plan for transition—if we do not do that effectively, then there's going to be a backlash.\nWith respect to immigration, it is America's experience that immigration has been, by far, a net plus for our economic growth, our culture, our way of life. Now, in America, that's by necessity, because unless you're a Native American, you came from some—everybody came from someplace else. Europe may not have as many of those traditions.\nBut keep in mind, one of the huge macroeconomic advantages that America has is we're still a relatively young country, our birth rate is not dropping off like Europe's is or Russia's is or China's or Japan's. And that's as a consequence of immigration. And it's economics 101, that if you've got a younger population, your growth rate is going to be higher.\nAnd immigrants are strivers, and they work hard. And they're looking to build a better life. Otherwise, they wouldn't move from where they were. And that's been part of our tradition and our culture and our society.\nNow, huge influxes of the sort that we've seen in Europe, that's always going to be a shock to the system. And I think it is entirely appropriate for Europe, even as generous as it has been—and I think that Chancellor Merkel deserves enormous credit, and other European leaders who have taken in these migrant populations deserve enormous credit, because that's hard. It's a strain on the budget. It's a strain on politics. It's a strain on culture. It's legitimate for them to say, look, we've got to slow this thing down. We've got to manage it properly.\nThat's why we're setting up a U.N. conference on refugees on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, because a few countries shouldn't be shouldering the burden for 60 million refugees. And we've got to come up with strategies to allow people in countries that are very poor or are in the middle of a war zone enjoy some peace and prosperity. Otherwise, the world has shrank, and they're going to want to move. And that's not going to go away anytime soon.\nSo it's one more reason why, given the fact of global integration, we have to think globally, more broadly. Because our security interests, our economies are all going to depend on the institutional arrangements that we have across boundaries.\nAnd NATO is an example of a really enduring multilateral institution that helped us get through some very difficult times. But even the best of institutions have to be adopted—adapted to new circumstances. That's true for organizations like NATO. It's true for organizations like the U.N. It's true for organizations like the EU. It's true for all the architecture that has helped the world and our countries improve their standard of livings and reduce overall violence between states substantially over the last several decades. Mark Landler [New York Times].\nFederal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You've been scrupulous about saying you would not comment on the Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mail. That investigation is now closed. And I hope that I could ask you about some of the comments that FBI Director Comey made a few days ago. As you know——\nThe President. You may, Mark, but I want you to make sure you're not wasting your question. I'm going to continue to be scrupulous about not commenting on it, just because I think Director Comey could not have been more exhaustive. My understanding is not only did he make a full presentation, but while we were over here, or at least flying, he was presenting to Congress for hours on end. But I just wanted to give you a chance, just in case you didn't want to burn your question.\nState Department's Handling of Classified Information/Cybersecurity/U.S. Military Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan/Counterterrorism Strategy/U.S. Foreign Policy\nQ. Okay. I actually have a backup. [Laughter]\nThe President. There you go.\nQ. Maybe I could cut to the chase and ask you about a broader question. Let's leave aside Mrs. Clinton for the moment. He did talk at the end of his presentation about how he feared that there was a broader cultural issue in the State Department toward the handling of classified information that troubled him. And I wondered whether you—since you rely on the State Department to conduct your foreign policy—whether that concerns you as well.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. And if I may, could I ask the other question, because I think it might get an interesting response. You, last May, passed a milestone in that you are now were President longer when the country was at war than your predecessor, George W. Bush. And if you complete your Presidency, as you will, with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you will be the only two-term President in American history to have served with the country at war. And I wonder, given the way that you ran for office and the aspirations you brought into office, how you feel about that reality? And then, a second follow-up on that: Should the American people simply resign themselves to living in a state of perpetual war, even if that war is not the all-out war that we think of in the 20th century?\nThe President. Okay. That was an interesting question so—first of all, with respect to the State Department, I am concerned. And the challenge that we've got is primarily driven by the changing nature of how information flows. Look, the advent of e-mail and texts and smartphones is just generating enormous amounts of data. Now, it is hugely convenient. It means that in real time I'm getting information that some of my predecessors might not have gotten for weeks.\nBut what it also is doing is creating this massive influx of information on a daily basis, putting enormous pressure on the Department to sort through it, classify it properly, figure out what are the various points of entry because of the cyber-attack risks that these systems have, knowing that our adversaries are constantly trying to hack into these various systems. If you overclassify, then all the advantages of this new information suddenly go away because it's taking too long to process. And so we've been trying to think about this in a smart way. And I think Secretary Kerry has got a range of initiatives to try to get our arms around this. It reflects a larger problem in Government. We just recently, for example—I just recently signed a bill about FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act requests, that built on a number of reforms that we've put in place. We're processing more Freedom of Information Act requests and doing so faster than ever before. The problem is the volume of requests has skyrocketed. The amount of information that answers the request has multiplied exponentially.\nSo, across Government, you're seeing this problem. And it's a problem in terms of domestic affairs. It becomes an even bigger problem when you're talking about national security issues. So it is something that we're going to have to take care of.\nWith respect to reflections on war, when I came into office, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we have a fraction of that. They are not involved in active combat situations, but are involved in \"train, advise, and assist\" situations, other than the direct attacks that we launch against ISIL in conjunction with the Iraq Government and the Syrian Government [partners on the ground in Syria; White House correction.].\nSo, in some ways, Mark, I think you'd recognize that our military operations today in Iraq and Afghanistan are fundamentally different than the wars that we were engaged in when I came into office. But I think you are making an important point, which is when we are dealing with nonstate actors, and those nonstate actors are located in countries with limited capacity, our ultimate goal is to partner with those countries so that they can secure their borders and, themselves, eliminate these terrorist threats.\nBut as we've seen in Afghanistan, for example, that takes some time. The Afghans are fighting. They are much more capable now than they were when I came into office. But they still need support, because it's really tough territory, and it's a really poor country with really low literacy rates and not much experience in things that we take for granted like logistics.\nAnd so we have an option of going in, taking out Al Qaida, pulling out, potentially then seeing a country crumble under the strains of continued terrorist activity or insurgency, and then going back in. Or we can try to maintain a limited partnership that allows them to continue to build their capacity over time and selectively take our own actions against those organizations that we know are trying to attack us or our allies.\nBecause they're nonstate actors, it's very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of McArthur and the Emperor meeting and a war officially being over. AQI was defeated in the sense that we were able to execute a transition to a democratically elected Iraqi Government. But for all of our efforts and the incredible courage and bravery and sacrifice of our troops, the political structure there was still uneven. You had continued Sunni resentments, continued de-Baathification, and as a consequence, those vestiges of AQI were able to reconstitute themselves, move into Syria as Syria began to engage in civil war, rebuild, and then come back in.\nSome have argued that this is the reason why we should have never pulled out of Iraq, or at least, we should have left some larger presence there. Of course, the problem was that we didn't have an Iraqi Government that wanted them, unlike Afghanistan, where we've been invited. And it's very difficult for us to—for me, as Commander in Chief, to want to put our troops in a precarious situation where they're not protected. So I think what we've been trying to do, what I've been trying to do, is to create an architecture, a structure—and it's not there yet—that emphasizes partnerships with countries, emphasizes building up fragile states, resolving internal conflicts wherever we can, trying to do as much as we can through our local partners, preserving the possibility, the necessity to take strikes ourselves against organizations or individuals that we know are trying to kill Americans or Belgians or French or Germans, combine that with much more effective intelligence gathering. But it becomes more of a hybrid approach to national security. And that I do think is probably going to be something that we have to continue to grapple with for years to come.\nThe good news is that there are fewer wars between states than ever before and almost no wars between great powers. And that's a great legacy of leaders in the United States and Europe and Asia, after the cold war—or after the end of World War II that built this international architecture. That's worked. And we should be proud of that and preserve it.\nBut this different kind of low-grade threat, one that's not an existential threat, but can do real damage and real harm to our societies and creates the kind of fear that can cause division and political reactions—we have to do that better. We have to continually refine it.\nSo, for example, the reason that I put out our announcement about the civilian casualties resulting from drone attacks—understanding that there are those who dispute the numbers—what I'm trying to do there is to institutionalize a system where we begin to hold ourselves accountable for this different kind of national security threat and these different kinds of operations.\nAnd it's imperfect, still. But I think we can get there. And what I can say honestly is, whether we're talking about how the NSA operates or how drone strikes operate or how we're partnering with other countries or my efforts to close Guantanamo, that by the end of my Presidency—or banning torture—by the end of my Presidency, I feel confident that these efforts will be on a firmer legal footing, more consistent with international law and norms, more reflective of our values and our ethics. But we're going to have more work to do. It's not perfect, and we have to wrestle with these issues all the time.\nAnd as Commander in Chief of the most powerful military in the world, I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I'm not satisfied that we've got it perfect yet. I can say honestly, it's better than it was when I came into office.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Poland.", "timestamp": "2016-07-09", "title": "The President's News Conference in Warsaw, Poland"}

We work closely together on a range of global challenges, including promoting international cooperation, peace and security, and economic prosperity. From fostering mutual economic growth to countering ISIL and undermining violent extremism, Spain is a vital ally, partner, and friend to the United States.\nStrong Security Cooperation: Spain and the United States are closely aligned on a range of issues. In addition to U.S. and Spanish cooperation in NATO, defense and security relations between the two countries are regulated by the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement and the Agreement on Defense Cooperation (ADC), signed September 2015. Under the ADC, Spain has authorized the United States the use of Moron Air Base for a permanent basing of a Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force - Crisis Response (SPMAGTF-CR) that is instrumental in protecting U.S. personnel and facilities in North and West Africa. Spain agreed to home-port four multi-mission, ballistic missile defense-capable U.S. destroyers at Rota Naval Station, the last of which arrived on September 25, 2015. Spanish-U.S. bilateral engagement includes over 70 annual exercises, thousands of ships and aircraft transiting through Spain, and a robust foreign military sales program.\nThe United States and Spain are strong allies in the fight against terrorism, and the United States partners with Spanish security forces deployed in key international missions around the globe. Spanish forces participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and conduct anti-piracy patrols off the Horn of Africa. Spain also contributes to the Counter-ISIL coalition, to counterterrorism operations in Libya and Syria, and to UN sanctions as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\nRobust Economic Ties: U.S.-Spanish cooperation on improving economic prosperity in the United States and Spain is an important facet of our bilateral relationship. Spain's accession to the European Union (EU) required the country to open its economy to trade and investment, modernize its industrial base, improve infrastructure, and revise economic legislation to conform to EU guidelines. Spain and the United States have a friendship, navigation, and commerce treaty and a bilateral taxation treaty. Spain is also the ninth largest and one of the fastest-growing investors in the United States, with a foreign direct investment stock of $42.3 billion. U.S. subsidiaries of Spanish firms employ over 80,000 U.S. workers in fields such as banking, wind and solar power, biofuels, road construction, and food. The United States is one of Spain's largest investors; U.S. companies employ more than 160,000 Spaniards, notably in the automotive and chemical industries. More than one million U.S. tourists visit Spain each year.\nCultural Bonds: Cultural exchange between the U.S. and Spain has historically been strong, and continues to reinforce the friendship between the two countries. The United States and Spain have a longstanding commitment to educational and cultural exchange, exemplified through both governments' support for the U.S.-Spain Fulbright Program. Almost 10,000 Spanish and U.S. students and scholars have benefitted from the program since its inception nearly 60 years ago. Each year, nearly 27,000 U.S. students study abroad in Spain, making Spain the third most popular destination for U.S. students worldwide. There are more than 6,000 Spaniards studying in the U.S. each year. More than 2,000 Spaniards have also participated in the International Visitor Leadership Program sponsored by the United States.", "timestamp": "2016-07-10", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-Spain Relations"}

I'm very happy to be your host in the name of the Spanish people, here at the Royal Palace, a symbol of our history, a history that gives our country a tradition of a strong engagement with the Americas and with the rest of the world. The United States and Spain share principles, values, and interests. The ties between our two nations have been strengthened intensely in every area. We are firmly committed to always maintaining the closest possible cooperation with the United States of America, a country that is our friend and that plays a decisive role around the globe.\nAnd in such a context of closeness and friendship, a crucial contribution is that of the many thousands of Spanish and U.S. citizens whose efforts are contributing every day to further strengthening the ties between two peoples that respect each other and that are able to look together towards the future with confidence and determination.\nMr. President, thank you very much for your stay here with us, which we so deeply appreciate and which is the very best expression of the sincere affection and abiding friendship that unites our two countries.\n[King Felipe spoke in English as follows.]\nI trust and hope, Mr. President, that in the future you will have further opportunities to visit us together with your family and to enjoy the many wonders that Spain, as you know, has to offer. Welcome.\nPresident Obama. Thank you.\nWell, good morning. And muchas gracias, Your Majesty. To the people of Spain and the Spanish Government, thank you so much for the extraordinary hospitality that you are offering me and my delegation. I wish I was staying longer. And I am so grateful for the understanding not only of His Majesty, but the people of Spain. We've had a difficult week back in the United States, so my trip is a little abbreviated. But I thought it was very important for me to come here, given the extraordinary friendship and alliance that exists between Spain and the United States.\nAlthough this is my first visit to Spain as the President of the United States, it is not my first visit to Spain or to Madrid. I confess, though, that the first time I came to Madrid was not on Air Force One. [Laughter] I was about to enter into law school. I had a backpack. I traveled by foot most of the time and ate very cheaply wherever I went. Never would I have imagined that I would have a reception with His Majesty. But it is an extraordinary privilege to be able to be here and to receive the hospitality that I hope we were able to extend when His Majesty and Her Majesty Queen Letizia were able to visit the White House last year.\nAs you noted, Your Majesty, not only do we have tremendous connections through family, through commerce, through people-to-people exchanges, through our outstanding educational and cultural institutions, not only are we allies, but we are also two countries that share values and ideals of freedom, rule of law, the respect for the dignity of all people. And it is for that reason that we find ourselves working together not only in our bilateral relationship, but across a spectrum of global issues. And it is incredibly important for us to have such a strong partnership with the Spanish Government and the Spanish people.\nAnd, Your Majesty, as with your father before you, you represent the strength and the spirit of the Spanish people. Your own connection to the United States has warmed the hearts of the American people and further strengthened the bond between our two countries. And as you showed during your visit to St. Augustine—the 450th anniversary of the connection between Spain and the New World—I am absolutely confident that the ties that bind us together will continue for many years to come.\nSo thank you for your hospitality. Thank you for the kindness that you and Her Majesty the Queen have extended to my family. And I can tell you that Michelle and my daughters love Spain and the Spanish people. And I very much look forward to continuing to build an extraordinary relationship between our two countries and hope my next visit, even if I'm not President, will be much longer than this one.", "timestamp": "2016-07-10", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Meeting With King Felipe VI of Spain in Madrid, Spain"}

Good morning, everybody. As you know, we've just had a meeting where we've addressed a number of issues, which I will be describing. First of all, I would like to welcome once again President—the President of the United States to the Palace of the Moncloa, President Barack Obama. I've thanked him, and I would like to thank him once again for coming before the end of his term. No U.S. President had visited Spain for 15 years last time—the last visit we had was 15 years ago.\nSo I would like to thank him particularly. I did it earlier, and I'd like to do it formally. On behalf of all Spaniards, I would like to thank him for maintaining his visit after the serious events that have taken place in his country. And I've expressed our sympathy and our affection for—to all the American people.\nI've also explained the—this country's situation at this time, especially from an economic standpoint. The President of the United States knows how the situation has evolved in our economy. He showed interest for our country's economy. When the crisis started in 2007, 2008, and when I was already President of the Government in 2012, we went through very difficult times, and now we see that those times have been overcome in spite of some pending issues.\nSpain is no longer in a recession. Spain is growing; it's the economy which is growing fastest in the EU. And jobs are no longer destroyed; jobs are being created. In 2015, we had very positive figures, as you know. And 2016 is also positive for the time being, and we hope things will continue like that.\nWe've overcome imbalances. We're more competitive. And the Spanish economy has bright prospects if it continues—we continue to have an economic policy to keep public accounts under control and if we continue to undertake structural reforms.\nWe've also spoken about the elections in Spain, the process that has concluded with the 26 June elections. And I told President Obama that I will do everything possible to form a Government as soon as possible. I think that having had to rerun the elections for the first time in the history of Spain was bad news, but having to have a third election would be very negative, and it would affect the economy and also our credibility in Spain and outside.\nWe've also discussed issues on the European Union. We've talked about Brexit. Spain's position in the negotiations with the U.K. will be constructive. I think that's what is reasonable and what makes sense. We've also talked about the refugee crisis and the immigration problems and immigration for economic reasons. Obviously, we have a position, and our position is that problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and we think that they should be resolved soon—the issue of Libya, the issue of Syria—because that will help us greatly.\nAnd I've also told President Obama about what I'm doing at the EU so the EU gets involved in resolving problems at the point of origin. A young person who has no prospects in his or her country—who has no prospects to live in his country, who can't have a dignified life—will do anything he can to leave his or her country and find something elsewhere. So problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and countries need to be helped. And we have to do it together with the European Union.\nWe've also talked about NATO relations. They're very good. We've talked about Rota, Morón. And I think things have been done properly with the consensus of most of Spanish society. And that's very good for Spain, and it's also very good for the United States and for all of us who defend democracy, freedom, human rights, and security for people.\nBilateral relations at this time are wonderful from all perspectives. The United States is the top investor in Spain—foreign investor. And the United States is the top country where Spanish companies invest as well.\nLastly, we've also addressed the situation in Cuba. We're optimistic for the future. We hope the outcome will be positive. And in Colombia, we wish lots of luck to President Santos because he's deploying great efforts. And we've also talked about Venezuela and the need to normalize the situation.\nSo we've addressed issues which are very important for Spain and for the United States. And I would like to conclude by saying, anyone who wants to hear me, that President Obama is a good friend of Spain's and a good friend of Spaniards. He's a committed person. He's honest and a person that we have cooperated with very pleasantly. We would be very pleased if he came back to Spain. He was already here lots of years ago, and he can come back whenever he wishes, because he will always be well remembered and welcome here.\nPresident Obama. Well, let me begin by thanking Prime Minister Rajoy and his team and the Spanish people for welcoming us. It has been an extraordinarily gracious and warm welcome, particularly given the tough situation that we've had at home and my need to rearrange my schedule.\nI was hoping for a longer stay, but I thought that it was important to make sure that, while I was still President, I visited such an important friend and ally. Because the relationship between us is a bond of friendship; it is an alliance relationship. We have shared economic and security interests. And we have shared values and ideals as two democracies. And the United States, given the size of its Spanish-speaking population or persons with Hispanic heritage, I think, feel a special connection to Spain.\nWe—I thought the Prime Minister summarized our conversations well. We meet here at a difficult, challenging time for Europe and for the world. We have a world that is integrating rapidly and presents enormous opportunities. But if our institutional arrangements don't ensure inclusion, if we do not coordinate effectively on economic and security issues, then it can present great dangers, both in terms of our own people feeling as if they're left—being left behind, as well as people from other countries fleeing bad situations, wanting to come here, or engaging in conflicts that create safe havens for terrorism and present future challenges to us.\nThe good news is, is that the relationship between the United States and Spain is extremely strong and we have been able to work together on a whole range of these issues. I'm confident that taking the approach that Spain has suggested on the Brexit negotiations, that that can be managed in a way that does not have an adverse impact on economic growth and opportunity for all of Europe, including the U.K., and will not have an adverse effect on the global economy.\nI want to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Spanish people for the economic progress that's been made over the last several years. It has been a difficult journey, but many of the changes that were taken are starting to bear fruit. And we still have more work to do, all of us, in improving the prospects for young people who are unemployed and creating more innovation and productivity and growth in our economies and making sure that those economies are broad based. So we discussed how we can do that on both sides of the Atlantic.\nWe just both came from the NATO meeting in Warsaw, and I want to thank the people of Spain and Spanish Armed Forces for the outstanding leadership that they provide on a whole spectrum of NATO initiatives, whether it's heading up one of NATO's new joint task forces, the incredible contribution that's provided by the Rota and Morón facilities and the hospitality shown to our forces, the work that the EU and NATO together are doing in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea. On all these issues, Spain has been a critical contributor. And Spain's men and women in uniform do an outstanding job.\nAs Prime Minister mentioned, we also are working together in some very difficult places, like the Middle East. And the contributions that Spain is making to training Iraqi military and police so that they can consolidate the gains that we're making against ISIL have been critically important, and we appreciate that very much as well.\nOutside of Europe and the Middle East, we also discussed Latin America, where we have a shared interest, given Spain's roots and strong relationships throughout the Spanish-speaking world and given the fact that what happens in the southern half of our hemisphere has a huge impact on us. We agree that Cuba offers the potential of new prosperity and new freedom if managed correctly, the process of normalization between the United States and Cuba. Our hope is, is that although it will not happen overnight, that it provides new opportunity for the people of Cuba.\nPeace in Colombia has been elusive for decades. And the fact that President Santos has been able to initiate these changes and forge a tentative, but very important peace deal, I think, promises greater prosperity and security for all the Colombian people.\nWe are jointly concerned about the situation in Venezuela. And our hope is, is that we can find a way in which all sides can come together, stabilize the Government, and stabilize the economy. And we want to be helpful, although, obviously, we cannot dictate the outcomes in Venezuela.\nLet me just conclude by saying that I definitely will come back as an ex-President, because Spain is beautiful. The food, the culture, the people, the weather—it's hard to resist. But—and I want to thank the extraordinary hospitality that's been shown to Michelle and my daughters when they've traveled here. They love it as well. So I think, as your children get older, they don't always want to spend time with you. But if you tell them, we'll take you to Spain—[laughter]—then it's a good way to bribe them and force them to spend time with you.\nBut as President of the United States, in my formal role, I want to express the warmth, the gratitude, the friendship that the American people feel towards the Spanish people. We share values. We share ideals. We believe in democracy. We believe in rule of law. We believe in the dignity of all people. And our work together across the international stage is hugely important.\nSo I hope that I'm setting a precedent so that it will not be another 15 years before the next U.S. President comes here.\nThank you very much.\nPrime Minister Rajoy. Thank you. President Obama. Are we starting with the American journalist or——\nState Department's Handling of Classified Information/Cybersecurity/Criminal Justice Reform/Black Lives Matter Movement\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the continued demonstrations we saw overnight in response to some of the police-involved shootings. But at the risk of suffering the same fate as one of my colleagues yesterday, I also wanted to return to the issue of Secretary Clinton's e-mails because some of the comments that you have made in the past yourself about this. You said in April that you continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America's national security. But this week, FBI Director Comey said that their assessment was that it was possible hostile actors gained access to her e-mails and that there's evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\nDo you accept that conclusion? And when you referred yesterday to the issue of overclassification, did you mean to suggest that some of the issues that were identified as classified might have been examples of that overclassification?\nOn to the other issue, you've commented in the past on some of the tactics of the Black Lives Matter's movement that you suggested have been counterproductive. We've seen continued protests, as I mentioned, overnight in many American cities over the Dallas tragedy. And as you prepare yourself to travel to Dallas, how would you advise the Black Lives Matter activists to approach this very sensitive issue—situation?\nAnd, Prime Minister Rajoy, the President said in an interview with El Pais that he hopes and expects this next Spanish Government will remain committed to a strong relationship with the U.S. and to Europe. Are you in a position to make that kind of guarantee? And despite some of the concerns you raised about a possible third election, are you in a position to rule out the possibility? Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Well, Mike [Michael A. Memoli, Los Angeles Times], on the first question, this has been a criminal investigation. The FBI Director took the extraordinary step of explaining in methodical fashion how they arrived at their conclusion. The Attorney General accepted the recommendation of the investigators. And as a consequence, I think it's inappropriate for me to second-guess or comment extensively on the conclusion that they arrived on.\nWhen I talked about the fact that there are legitimate concerns around how information travels in the State Department, it's across the spectrum. It has to do with the volumes of information that are now being transmitted, who has access to them, concerns about cyber attacks and cybersecurity, concerns about making sure that we're transmitting information in real time so that we can make good decisions, but that it's not being mishandled in the process or making us more vulnerable.\nAnd without commenting on what Director Comey said, I can tell you that Secretary Kerry is and has been concerned about this generally and has stood up initiatives to try to improve those information flows and that I'm concerned about this throughout the Government, generally. It just has a particular salience when you're talking about diplomatic cables and issues involving national security.\nAnd I don't think we have it perfectly solved. I think we're going to have to do better and learn from mistakes. And some of that will have to do with intentional—or some of that will have to do with changing systems. Some of it will have to do with how we train personnel from the very top: how I use my smartphone or BlackBerry, all the way down to the lowest-level staffer.\nBut we've seen problems on this. WikiLeaks was a big piece of business. And it wasn't intentional, but what it exposed was that there were a lot of vulnerabilities there. We know we've had hacking in the White House. And how people handle information, the precautionary steps that are taken, all those things are being examined thoroughly. And I think it will be a work in progress over time.\nWith respect to your second question, one of the great things about America is that individual citizens and groups of citizens can petition their government, can protest, can speak truth to power. And that is sometimes messy and controversial. But because of that ability to protest and engage in free speech, America, over time, has gotten better. We've all benefited from that.\nThe abolition movement was contentious. The effort for women to get the right to vote was contentious and messy. There were times when activists might have engaged in rhetoric that was overheated and occasionally counterproductive. But the point was to raise issues so that we, as a society, could grapple with it. The same was true with the civil rights movement and the union movement and the environmental movement, the antiwar movement during Vietnam. And I think what you're seeing now is part of that longstanding tradition.\nWhat I would say is this: that whenever those of us who are concerned about fairness in the criminal justice system attack police officers, you are doing a disservice to the cause. First of all, any violence directed at police officers is a reprehensible crime, and it needs to be prosecuted. But even rhetorically, if we paint police in broad brush, without recognizing that the vast majority of police officers are doing a really good job and are trying to protect people and do so fairly and without racial bias, if our rhetoric does not recognize that, then we're going to lose allies in the reform cause.\nNow, in a movement like Black Lives Matter, there's always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid or imprudent or overgeneralize or are harsh. And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest site. But I would just say to everybody who's concerned about the issue of police shootings or racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful and serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change. And that is our ultimate objective.\nNow, this week, people felt hurt and angry, and so some of this is just venting. But I think that the overwhelming majority of people who are involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, what they really want to see is a better relationship between the police and the community so that they can feel that it's serving them. And the best way to do that is to bring allies aboard. That means—that includes, by the way, police departments that are doing the right thing, like Dallas, which has implemented the very reforms that Black Lives Matter is seeking. That's part of why it's so tragic that those officers were targeted in Dallas, a place that is—because of its transparency and training and openness and engagement with the community—has drastically brought down the number of police shootings and complaints about misconduct.\nThe flip side of that—and this is the last point I'll make—is just as my hope would be that everybody who is involved in the Black Lives Matter's movement or other civil rights organizations or who are protesting, just as I want all of them to maintain a respectful, thoughtful tone, because as a practical matter, that's what's going to get change done, I would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustrations that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests and these complaints as political correctness or as politics or attacks on police. There are legitimate issues that have been raised, and there's data and evidence to back up the concerns that are being expressed by these protesters.\nAnd if police organizations and departments acknowledge that there's a problem and there's an issue, then that, too, is going to contribute to real solutions. And as I said yesterday, that is what's going to ultimately help make the job of being a cop a lot safer. It is in the interest of police officers that their communities trust them and that the kind of rancor and suspicion that exists right now is alleviated.\nSo I'd like all sides to listen to each other. And that's what we'll hopefully be able to accomplish over the course of the next week and over the course of the remaining months that I'm President.\nPrime Minister Rajoy. Whatever happens when we try to form a new Government in Spain, well, that's something we'll see in the coming days how it proceeds. But I'm certain that everyone is going to act responsibly and that, therefore, Spain will soon have a Government.\nIn Spain, foreign policy and defense policy are generally the subject of an agreement among the largest political parties. We are in NATO at this time. We have reached agreements with the U.S. Government in Rota. Our troops are present in many countries around the world. They're in Turkey. They're in Iraq. They've been the Baltic. They're in Lebanon. And all the missions of the Spanish Army or of the civil guard or other police go through Parliament and they're voted on by members of Parliament. And there is an agreement on defense policy in Spain among the large traditional parties, and I'm sure that that's going to continue to be the case in the future.\nThe same applies to foreign policy. The major decisions in the area of foreign policy are also the subject of an agreement between the government of a nation and the party supporting it and at least the second largest political force, which has always been in power in Spain for many years. So foreign policy and defense policy and the relations with the United States, with whom we're a trustworthy and serious ally and we share the same principles and values, all of that will continue in the future, regardless of the outcome of the elections. I have no doubt about that. It's always been that way. At some specific points in time in our history, there have been disagreements, but most of the decisions on defense policy, foreign policy, and U.S.-Spain relations are always the subject of an agreement supported by the Spanish people.\nSpain-U.S. Relations/U.S. Presidential Election/Economic Globalization\nQ. I'd like to ask President Obama if he's concerned about how long it's taking to form a Government in Spain and whether that can affect the U.S.-Spain relations and also whether you think in both countries populists could come to power.\nAnd I'd like to ask President Rajoy the following. You said that you had told Mr. Obama that you would like to have a Government in Spain soon. I don't know whether you've gone into the details as to the agreements to form a Government. And regarding the next elections in the United States, do you think that if Trump wins, that would be worrying for the United States and for the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Spain relations? Thank you. President Obama. Well, I think Prime Minister Rajoy is absolutely right that although it matters a great deal to us that we have a stable, well-functioning Spanish Government, the nature of the relationship, the bond between the United States and Spain is not dependent on which party is in power, in the same way that my expectation would be that, although there might be differences in foreign policy if I had a successor that was Republican rather than Democrat, there would still be a core interest as fellow NATO members who are concerned about terrorism and are concerned about a wide range of international and security and economic issues.\nSo I wish the Prime Minister luck. He did not go into the details, by the way. It's not my job to figure out what all the ins and outs of negotiations may be in forming a Spanish Government. But I'm very confident that whatever Government emerges, we'll be able to work with them effectively on a whole range of issues.\nAs you point out, I've got my own politics to worry about back home. [Laughter] And I won't comment on the U.S. election, because I think that's for the American people ultimately to decide. I am—what I would say is, is that I have great confidence in the American people, their goodness, their values, their decency, their common sense. And although our political process is messy and dominated by too much money, and it lasts too long, and there's a lot of rhetoric that is all over the place, at the end of the day, I think people recognize the importance of the office of the President and that the United States occupies a unique role in the world and will take that decision about who sits in the Oval Office very seriously.\nThere are some connections between populist impulses and voices in the United States and what's happening here in Europe, whether what we've seen in Brexit or other parties that have arisen in other European countries. And I would just go back to what I've said before, that if global integration does not work for everybody, if it simply helps elites and you see growing inequality and people feel left behind, then you will get a crude populism that often is divisive. And that's not good for anybody. But those kinds of politics will grow.\nIf, like me, you believe that the exchange of trade and communications and culture and ideas and greater global understanding and integration can be a good thing, then that has to be accompanied with policies that address inequality, that make sure workers are getting fair wages and that the social compact and the social welfare system is strengthened for the 21st century and we're attentive to environmental concerns and other concerns that have been raised by progressive organizations.\nIf we ignore those things, then that—those fears and anxieties will be challenged—or be channeled in an unproductive way. If we address them squarely, then I think politics on both sides of the Atlantic will be just fine.\nPrime Minister Rajoy. There were two questions, whether I've explained to the U.S. President what I'm going to do to get an agreement so that there can be a Government and so new elections can be avoided. Well, I haven't gone into those details because, naturally, we don't go into that kind of detail.\nBut what I will say is that Spain has urgent matters ahead of it. First, we have to approve a budget, an expenditure cap, and get the situation back to normalcy and to continue growing and creating jobs.\nSecondly, I'm going to ask for a broad consensus on European policy where we'll see very important matters coming up in the coming months, starting with Brexit, refugee problems, the European integration process, and so on. And then, my concerns for the future are mostly four or five: first, employment; two, keeping our welfare state; three, combatting terrorism; four, defending the unity of Spain; and five, having a foreign and defense policy like the one we have had in the past 4 years in our country.\nSo, on that basis, I think we can build, and I think we should build, because as I've said, we've had an acting Government for a long time. For the time being, this hasn't affected our economy. Jobs are being created. I think this year is going to be good as far as job creation goes. But we shouldn't play with fire. I think that too much time has gone by, and Spain needs a Government as soon as possible.\nRegarding the Government of the United States and the candidate on which you asked your question, allow me to say something obvious. The President of the United States will be whoever the American people decides. And the rest of us have nothing to say about that and much less when you're President of a Government of a country that's a friend.\nAnd based on that, our relations, I'm sure, will be good. They will continue to be like they've been. Because peoples and countries are above individuals, and there are a lot of things that bring us together. There's a lot of joint work, and there's a lot of plans for the future. Individuals are also important, but it's mainly the shared history and the willingness to work together for the future that matter.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-07-10", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters in Madrid, Spain"}

Buenas tardes! Please, everybody, have a seat. Thank you, Minister Morenes, for your kind introduction, for your leadership, and for your partnership. We could not ask for a better ally than Spain.\nI want to recognize your outstanding leadership team here at Rota. Vice Admiral Jaime Foggo, give him a big round of applause. Come on, guys. [Applause] Captain Mike MacNicholl. Now, apparently, Mike has only been here 3 weeks. Five days after he started, the Secretary of the Navy visited. And now here comes the President. So we're testing Mike a little bit. It's like the in-laws coming over. [Laughter] But he is doing an outstanding job already. We have great confidence in him. And I also want to acknowledge Command Master Chief Michelle Brooks. I tend to like people named Michelle. [Laughter] And you spell it right, with two l's. [Laughter] It's the right way to do it.\nNow, we've got quite a group here today. We've got sailors from the United States Navy. We've got the Air Force 725th Maintenance Squadron. We've got marines from Morón. [Applause] Marines, hey! [Laughter] We've got outstanding civilian personnel. Don't be left out, civilians. Let's make some noise. [Applause] And of course, we've got the loved ones who serve by your side. Give it up for our incredible military families. Woo!\nAnd we're proud to be joined by our outstanding Spanish allies and friends. Marineros from Spain's armada. I want to—yes, we can clap. [Applause] Come on! See, the Spanish are a little more polite than we are. [Laughter] Right? We're just yelling.\nI want to acknowledge Admiral Muñoz-Delgado, Admiral Suanzes, and [Vice]* Admiral González Gómez. And on behalf of the American people, I want to thank Mayor Arana and everyone in this community and this country for being such great hosts and partners and friends to all the American personnel and their families who are here in Spain. We're grateful. Muchas gracias.\nNow, I'm not going to give a long speech. I know you've been standing here for—or sitting here for a while, and it's a little warm. But what I really wanted to do is come down and shake some hands. You know, I—look, I'll be honest, it's been a tough week back home. And I've had to adjust my schedule. I was going to be in Spain for 2 days; now I'm just here for a day. But I didn't want to miss the opportunity to come and thank all of you for your outstanding service.\nI just wrapped up our 2 days of meetings at the NATO summit in Warsaw, in Poland. And obviously, it's a challenging time for all of our countries. Recent terrorist attacks have shaken America and France and Belgium and Turkey. Migrants who are seeking refuge, many from war-torn countries, are flocking to Europe. Russia's aggression against the Ukraine threatens our vision of a Europe that is at peace. And a vote in Britain has raised questions about the kind of Europe that we're going to see in the years ahead.\nSo, on my visit to Europe, what I've been trying to communicate, what I've been wanting to focus on is America's relation to Europe and the fact that our commitment will not change. We have an enduring commitment to the transatlantic alliance and to our allies in Europe because you are central to our security, and we could not have a more important alliance or a better set of friends than those of us—those of you here in Europe. That includes a strong and unified Spain, one of our closest allies.\nThe alliance between our countries is rooted in shared values of democracy and pluralism and open markets and our shared commitment to freedom. For more than 60 years, Spain has hosted Americans here at Rota. Today, this base is home to more than 3,000 Americans. And it's the home port for American destroyers that strengthen our alliance's new missile defense, as I just saw during my visit aboard the USS Ross. Although, I will say, when I visit ships these days, I feel like an old man, because the average age is, like, 21 on these ships. And I had to tell some of the folks onboard that you couldn't put me in charge of anything at 21. So the fact that they're doing such incredible work makes me really proud.\nBut day in and day out, Americans and Spaniards like you serve together, shoulder to shoulder, not only here, but in missions for our common security: in the coalition to destroy ISIL, combating piracy, supporting peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. And that's because we believe that people around the world, and here in Europe, have the right to live in security and prosperity and dignity. That's what America stands for, that's what Spain stands for, and that's what NATO stands for.\nSo my message today is that we're going to keep standing together to meet the challenges of our time. In the face of terrorist networks that seek to destroy, we're going to prevail not only because of our military strength, but because we will stay true to our values: our diversity, our respect for one another, our refusal to be divided by ethnicity or nationality or religion. In the face of humanitarian crises, we're going to deliver help and hope to those in need. In the face of aggression, we'll stand up for the sovereignty of nations like Ukraine. And in this moment of uncertainty in Europe, we'll remain steadfast allies through NATO, the strongest alliance that the world has ever known.\nSo, Team Rota, all of you embody this spirit of cooperation and resolve as well as anyone. And my main message here today is to say thank you. Thank you for your service on behalf of a safer America, a safer Spain, and a safer world. And to all our Spanish friends, thank you for your friendship and thank you for your service.\nTo all the Americans who are here, I know it's never easy serving far away from home, although, I must say, if you've got to be away from home, this is not a bad place to be. [Laughter] But even in a place as beautiful as this, you're missing holidays and birthdays and family reunions. But each and every day, you stand up for our country, and you do it with honor, and you do it with courage, and you do it with commitment. So, on behalf of a grateful nation, let me just say that we're proud of you. We honor you. We thank you for your service, and we thank your inspiring families as well, for all that they do to make sure that you can do your jobs.\nAt a time when sometimes the world feels uncertain, sometimes, people ask me, how do you stay so calm? And what I tell them is, as tough as the challenges are, as serious as the threats that we face, the one thing that I have learned during the time that I've had the privilege to be the President of the United States is that the American people are good and they are decent. And we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known. We have great partners around the world. And I am absolutely confident that people of good will will ultimately overcome those forces that seek to divide and destroy us. You give me confidence. You give me hope. God bless you. God bless the United States of America! God bless Spain! Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-07-10", "title": "Remarks to United States and Spanish Troops at Naval Station Rota in Rota, Spain"}

Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.\nIt is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end – and to end right now.\nWe went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas. For too many police today, that is their daily reality.\nAt the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected. We were all disturbed by the images we saw.\nWe must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities. According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone. This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans.\nViolent crime has increased in cities across America. The New York Times described \"a startling rise in murders,\" in our major cities.\nBrutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland.\nToo many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty.\nOur inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community.\nWe must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country.\nI am the law and order candidate.\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent.\nPersonally, I think she is both.\nNot only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion. But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States. Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood.\nEveryone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice.\nWe will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair – and we will protect all Americans.\nWithout safety, we have nothing!\nIt is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again — For Everyone.\nThat promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas.\nThe men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America.\nNow is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country.\nWe made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you.\nBut that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made – not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.\nPresident Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most.\nHillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that \"it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.\"\nShe actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run – that's because she has been part of the rigged system.\nPerhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives – instead of spending time with real people in real pain.\nThe disconnect in America is deep.\nThere are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.\nThe VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable.\nAn internal memo from a senior VA official describes \"lawlessness and chaos,\" at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules.\nThe memo also says they \"waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws\" and warns that \"these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans.\"\nEven the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described \"significant and chronic systemic failures,\" in Veterans Affairs, including \"a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department,\" with \"poor management,\" and \"a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues.\" He said there is a \"lack of accountability across all grade levels.\"\nHere are just a few examples:\n--Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix.\n--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times.\n--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender.\n--The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down.\n--The St. Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012.\nCan you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017?\nMost of those responsible have still not been held to account.\nFixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities – and it will happen. It will be fixed.\nThat begins with a simple promise: every Veteran will get timely access to top-quality care\nVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.\nWe must extend this right to all Veterans– not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy.\nThis promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans.\nWe must also do more to help our Veterans find jobs\nEvery year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans.\nVeterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First.\nVeterans' health care must also include the best mental health care.\nA shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans.\nThis is a national tragedy.\nThe evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system.\nThat is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA – while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well.\nAmerica must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large. This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need – especially in emergencies.\nOne of the most important reforms we can make is accountability\nRight now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them.\nThat's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform.\nIn fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions.\nIn 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget.\nTwo other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits.\nIt doesn't have to be this way.\nAs Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said: \"The VA is not sacred. The Veteran is.\"\nHere is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America:\nOne:\nI will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA.\nThe Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans – not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans. Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland.\nTwo:\nI am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust.\nThree:\nI am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran.\nFour:\nI am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform.\nFive:\nI am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions.\nSix:\nI will create a private White House Hotline – that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day – to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks.\nI will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be.\nThat's a promise.\nSeven:\nWe are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste.\nIf an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers.\nEight:\nWe are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line.\nNine:\nWe are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system.\nTen:\nWe are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.\nNever again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve.\nWe need to clean out the corruption in Government, and Hillary Clinton will never be able to do it\nShe is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again.\nCrooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo – and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow.\nOur country needs change, and she will never give us change.\nThe fact is, she helped create our rigged system.\nHillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.\nThe rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk.\nHillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials.\nIn other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not.\nHer conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful – and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt.\nThis was not just extreme carelessness with classified material – which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct – followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.\nIn fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath.\nShe carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world.\nAfterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up.\nThe fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment.\nWhen thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions. These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly.\nIf elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check.\nJust look at what the FBI Director said about her – her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.\nClearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.\nThe decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end.\nThe years of American Greatness will return.\nWe are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country.\nWe are going to make American Great Again – And Safe Again – For All Americans.\nWe will dream big and bold and daring things once more.\nLet me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.\nOur debt to them is eternal and everlasting.\nWe are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.\nWe will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-07-11", "title": "Remarks in Virginia Beach, Virginia"}

Happy Monday. I've got a couple of things to go through before we get to your questions, but most of this is focused on scheduling, both today, tomorrow, and on Wednesday.\nThe first update is that the President has joined the meeting with the Vice President that the Vice President's team had organized for today. This was a meeting that the Vice President convened with leaders in law enforcement to talk about, of course, the tragedy that occurred just a few days ago in Dallas, but to talk about the challenging job that those officers across the country have. It's something that the President has talked about on a number of occasions. The President has had an opportunity to meet with law enforcement leaders on a number of occasions, and he's quite interested in making sure that that dialogue continues.\nSo we'll have a readout of that meeting once it has concluded, and we're going to work on getting you a list of law enforcement officials who attended the meeting.\nThe second thing is, the President, as you know, is preparing to travel to Dallas, Texas tomorrow at the invitation of Mayor Rawlings. The city of Dallas is organizing a memorial service for the five police officers who were killed there last week. President Obama will speak there. He'll be joined on the trip by the First Lady, Mrs. Obama. Vice President Biden will also be attending the services and he'll be joined by his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. I also understand that former President George W. Bush, who, of course, lives in the Dallas area, will also be there, and he'll be attending with his wife, Mrs. Bush, as well.\nOn Wednesday, the President will convene another meeting here at the White House that will include law enforcement officials, but it will also include activists, academics, civil rights leaders, local political leaders from across the country, to, again, try to further the dialogue and the identification of specific solutions to repairing the bonds of trust that have frayed in so many communities between law enforcement officials and the citizens that they're sworn to serve and protect.\nSo this, too, is a continuation of the conversation that the President initiated a couple of years ago. The White House worked to form a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that reflected a diverse set of perspectives. That task force generated a specific report of best practices that many law enforcement agencies across the country have sought to implement. Not all of them have. And it's the President's view that the effort to implement those best practices needs to be reenergized. And as the President observed on a number of occasions over the last several days, last week was a tough week for our country, and it should serve as sufficient motivation for communities across the country to come together and make the implementation of these best practices a genuine priority in their community.\nThe kinds of solutions that were identified by the task force are not going to solve every problem, but we know they can have a material impact in improving the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens of individual communities. And by doing so, we don't just ensure that the rights of all citizens are protected, we also make sure that law enforcement officials -- who have a very dangerous job -- are also protected, and they can be more effective in fighting crime if they can work effectively with the community to focus on that job.\nSo we'll have more to say about Wednesday's meeting as it gets closer. We'll have more to say about who the attendees are at that meeting as it gets closer, too. And obviously, all of these things are being put together on rather short notice, but these are priorities that the President has had for quite some time and he'll be spending quite a bit of time on them over the course of this week.\nSo, with that, Kevin, we can go to your questions on this topic or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nQ: Is there going to be opportunities, perhaps at the stakeout, to ask questions of the people who are participating in the meeting today, as well as on Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know at this point whether or not that is part of the plan of those officials who are attending the meeting today. But if that was something that they wanted to do, we certainly wouldn't stop them.\nQ: The President's address at the memorial service tomorrow comes with a mission that goes beyond consoling. People in the law enforcement community, people who have been protesting police actions will be listening to every word. Can you talk a little bit about the points that the President wants to strive to make tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, let me start by saying that the President's schedule is a little lighter than originally planned today because the President originally planned to be in Spain today. Obviously the President had to cut short his trip and he returned last night. The President does expect to devote a significant portion of his day today to working on his remarks. I haven't gotten an update on where they stand.\nFortunately, however, the President has had multiple opportunities over the last three or four days to address this situation, not just in Dallas but across the country. And so I think you have a good sense of where his head is; you also have a good sense of where his heart is. And I think you can expect that the speech that the President will deliver tomorrow will be appropriate for the setting, which is a memorial service. The President certainly has a desire to offer his condolences to the families of those who were lost and to also the broader community in Dallas that's grieving because of the loss of these five individuals who served their community so selflessly.\nThe President also has an interest in trying to offer some comfort to people all across the country. It's been a tough week for our country. And the President recognizes that it's not just people in Dallas who are grieving, but people all across the country who are concerned about the violence that so many Americans have witnessed in the last week or so. And the truth is, this is violence that we've been witnessing not just in the last week but far too often over the last several years. And I think many Americans are troubled by it. And the President is hoping to offer some measure of comfort tomorrow.\nQ: So even before last week's violence, surveys were indicating that fewer Americans were feeling good about the state of race relations in the country than when the President came into office. Does the President understand that growing pessimism? Does he believe it's misplaced? Does he agree that fewer Americans do feel better about the state of race relations today than a few years ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think that if you examine the progress that our country has made, there's just no denying how important that progress has been. That progress can be measured in a variety of ways. The President had the opportunity to discuss this in his remarks in Selma, Alabama last year. And the speech was so well received in part because he made I think an observation that many Americans -- black, white and brown -- can relate to, which is that to deny the progress that our country has made over the last several decades is to deny recognition of the sacrifices that Americans -- black, white and brown -- made in pursuit of that progress.\nThat work is by no means finished. There is significant work that remains to be done, and the President talked about this a little bit on Thursday night when we arrived in Warsaw, that there continue to be persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system, for example. If we're going to live up to our Founding Fathers' vision of striving to form a more perfect union, then that's something we need to be not just mindful of, we need to make that a priority and strive to address those persistent disparities.\nSo it's hard for any one person to assess the optimism or pessimism of the country on a particular social issue. But the President remains remarkably optimistic about the progress that our country has made.\nThe President also talked about how he draws a sense of optimism from the way that people have reacted to the tragic events over the last week or so. It's not just black Americans who are concerned and have their conscience aroused when seeing the shootings of two African Americans in two very different communities in this country. It's not just white Americans who are appalled at the way that a shooter targeted white cops. There was almost unanimous condemnation of that act. And I think that reflects the unity that exists in our country that sometimes is obscured by the political division in our nation's capital and the political debate that may take place in the media. But the President believes that our country has made remarkable progress and we are far more unified than it may seem if you just watched 30 minutes of cable TV.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, the President said in the press conference over the weekend that he wanted to meet with his task force this week and look at taking some concrete actions. What kinds of concrete actions does he have in mind? And if there are concrete actions that can be taken, why haven't we taken them before?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, this will be the subject of the discussion. And I think the first thing that I would observe is that the best practices that were put forward by the Task Force on 21st Century Policing that was formed by the White House a couple years ago, and released results a year and a half ago or so -- were the observations that they had is because most law enforcement work is done at the local level and that there are limits on how much pressure federal officials can apply to local organizations and local law enforcement organizations as they consider what sort of reform policies should be implemented -- what sort of changes they should make to their training regimen, for example; what sort of decisions they should make about equipment procurement; what sort of decisions they should make about transparency.\nOne of the distinguishing features of the reform process that was pursued in Dallas is that there was a remarkable -- there has been for the last few years a remarkable amount of transparency that the Dallas Police Department has implemented when it comes to documenting, for example, violent interactions between police officers and citizens. And that has had the effect of enhancing trust and improving statistics about complaints that are filed by citizens against police officers. At the same time, they've also experienced in Dallas a historic reduction in crime. Crime is -- violent crime and murder rates and other statistics are at or near historic lows in Dallas.\nSo I think that's a good illustration of how important reform efforts needn't come at the expense of crime fighting. In fact, reforming police departments and enhancing trust with the public benefits law enforcement, benefits crime fighting. That's the whole goal. And it's tragically ironic that Dallas is a particularly good illustration of how leaders in the community and leaders of a city can make that a priority and enjoy the benefits of it.\nQ: Is police department reform -- is that one of the things that would be a concrete action?\nMR. EARNEST: That certainly will be part of the discussion, I'm sure. But I'm confident that there will be a broader discussion about what steps civil rights leaders and leaders in the community can take to address some of these challenges. I think there will be a discussion about what ordinary Americans can do. But, look, the discussion is still a couple days away. We're still organizing the meeting itself -- still trying to figure out where to hold it and who to invite. So we'll obviously have a whole lot more that we can say about this meeting once we've gotten closer to having it.\nQ: On a separate topic, Secretary Carter announced today that the United States will be sending 560 more troops to Iraq. When did the President sign off on this? And will that be enough for the mission to go into Mosul?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, you're referring to an announcement that Secretary Carter made during a visit to Iraq earlier today, and his announcement was based on the recent success that Iraqi security forces had enjoyed in retaking a military airfield in Iraq -- a place called Qarayyah. And the idea is that Iraqi security forces will use this base, this airfield, as a logistics hub that can certainly enhance their ability to encircle Mosul and eventually drive ISIL out of Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq and a place that has essentially been a locus of power for ISIL in Iraq.\nSo this announcement about the addition of American troops represents a following-up on the successful effort of the Iraqis to continue to make progress against ISIL. So the idea is that these new U.S. forces would be used to secure the airfield and essentially get it up and running as a logistics hub that would support ongoing operations by Iraqi security forces. And this is entirely consistent with the strategy that the President has laid out, which is that the United States and our coalition partners will be committed to supporting Iraqi forces as they take the fight to ISIL.\nAnd there are a wide range of capabilities and expertise that we can lend to that effort, and part of that is offering some assistance when it comes to logistics. And that's primarily what this effort is all about. I can't give you a specific day when the President signed off on this, but this is certainly consistent with the idea that the President's national security team, including his leaders at the Department of Defense, are focused on areas where we can leverage investments in tactics that have worked. And we know that one of the significant challenges that Iraqi forces have faced is managing long supply lines. And there's something that we can do to shorten the supply lines in a way that can have a tangible effect on the battlefield and a tangible impact on our strategy to go after ISIL in Mosul.\nQ: Will this be enough? Or do you expect he'll be having to approve more?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, at this point I don't have any -- I'm not in a position to foreshadow any additional announcements about additional troop commitments. But the President has been very clear about what our mission is and what our mission isn't. And this is an effort to reinforce our support for Iraqi forces that are enjoying some success in driving ISIL out of strategic important areas in Iraq that can put them in a position to succeed on a much bigger goal of driving ISIL out of Iraq's second largest city.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, in relation to the horrific incidents last week, President Obama is now holding, as you said, Wednesday, this conversation with civil rights leaders, some leaders -- law enforcement. A few months back he said after one of these, yet again, police-involved fatal shootings, the President said he wasn't going to have -- he wasn't going to lead the conversation from this podium. What's changed with this dynamic? And has he talked to Sylvia Burwell, the head of HHS, who was the head of President Clinton's race initiative when he was President of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I recall the day when the President made that declaration, and I think it reflected some impatience on his part. The President's view is we spend a lot of time talking about these issues, and he's impatient to start seeing some results. So I think you can expect that the conversation that he's having today with law enforcement and the conversation that he'll have with a more diverse set of views on Wednesday will be focused on what are specific steps that we can take to address some of these racial disparities in our criminal justice system that are persistent and measurable, but what are also some steps that we can take to do even more to support our men and women in uniform that have an extraordinarily difficult job.\nThe President has talked at length as recently as Thursday night when he arrived in Warsaw -- hours before the shooting in Dallas, I might remind you -- about what a difficult job our men and women in uniform have; that too often we ask our men and women in uniform, police officers, to confront challenges in communities that the rest of us would just as soon forget.\nWe're talking about certain communities that have inadequate schools, and very little economic opportunity, maybe they don't have access to health care. In some cases, they don't have access to a grocery store that serves healthy -- or that sells healthy food. Our system has been insufficiently attentive to those core needs that we know have an impact on these communities.\nInstead, we ask law enforcement to go and solve those problems -- or at least deal with the consequences of inattention to those problems. That's not fair. And the President believes that there is more that we should be doing as a country -- certainly as a federal government, but also at the state and local level, as well -- to make those critical investments in education, to make those critical investments that we know are going to give those families that are working hard to get in the middle class the opportunity to actually succeed.\nWe could raise the minimum wage -- something the President has been advocating for years. Right now if you're trying to raise a family of four and working full-time, making minimum wage, you're raising the family below the poverty line. That is unacceptable, inconsistent with our values, and leads to much bigger problems -- problems that we too often just delegate to law enforcement. That's not fair.\nI think it is an illustration of how difficult their job is. And if there are specific things that we can do to better support our men and women in blue, the President believes we should get about doing it.\nQ: I have a couple more questions on this subject. In the '60s, the Kerner Commission came out with a report, and the Kerner Commission -- basically because of police brutality in the black community at that time -- and the Kerner report said something to the effect that there are two societies, separate and unequal. And then, when it came down to policing -- and I'm quoting from the report -- it said, \"Negros firmly believe that police brutality and harassment occurred repeatedly in Negro neighborhoods.\" It also went on to say, \"In several cities, the principal response has been to train and equip the police with more sophisticated weapons.\" What's changed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a lot has changed. I think one of the things that we know -- you take a place like Dallas, I guess, would be a pretty good example. I know that there has been an effort by many law enforcement agencies to ensure that their police force is more diverse. That certainly is one thing that's changed. I think there has been a priority that many law enforcement organizations have placed on improved and enhanced training of their officers. And again, a place like Dallas is a pretty good example of where complaints about excessive force filed against police officers have declined precipitously since the police chief imposed stricter training requirements and oriented that training to focus on de-escalation tactics to try to prevent confrontations between police officers and citizens from spiraling into a violent confrontation.\nSo there's progress to identify, but there's a lot more work that we need to do. And the President believes that we're only going to make additional progress when there is a collective recognition of the fact that that progress will only be made when we make these solutions a priority.\nQ: President Obama marked -- since he got to Warsaw, he marked the situation that happened in Baton Rouge, and then he also marked both the issues in Louisiana and Minnesota. And then he marked the situation in Dallas. But he's going to Dallas. And there's a certain part of this nation that's wondering why he's not going to Louisiana or to Minnesota. Can you explain why?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I don't have any updates about the President's travel. But, again, on Thursday night, on Friday morning, on Saturday at the news conference that he convened at the end of NATO, and then again yesterday in Madrid, Spain, where he was meeting his Spanish counterpart, the President had an opportunity at each of those occasions to talk about his concern about this situation and the priority that he places on trying to address these persistent problems. So I think you'd be hard-pressed to think of anybody -- with the possible exception of officials in Dallas -- who has been more public and more definitive about the fact that addressing these disparities is a priority for the President of the United States, and finding a way to enhance the safety and security of our men and women in law enforcement.\nAnd again, with the possible exception of officials in Dallas, no one has been more outspoken about that priority in the last four days than the President of the United States. He recognizes that this is a time for leadership. That's what he's provided. That's why he came home early from his trip. And I think you'll see more of that on display in the next couple of days.\nQ: And last question. What does the images that you've seen from average citizens or loved ones of those who were fatally shot by police -- what does it say when you see images from video cameras or video phones from other people and not the body cameras from the police?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm just trying to understand your question. Are you suggesting that --\nQ: What I'm asking is, the President was very -- he was pushing this effort for body cameras for more accountability. And in Louisiana, the body cameras fell off. And we saw a video from the fiancйe in Minnesota. And then we saw videos from people who were driving by in Baton Rouge and from the store. It was not from police. The Baton Rouge police cameras fell off. What does this say to his efforts that he's trying to hold the accountability piece for policing, to support good policing and weed out the bad policing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as you know, April, there's an ongoing Department of Justice investigation into this situation in Baton Rouge, and I know that federal investigators are -- it is their standard practice to gather as much information as possible, including video evidence about what may have transpired. That's their standard practice. I'm confident that they're following that standard practice in this instance. For an update on the investigation, you're just going to have to ask the Department of Justice about that.\nThe situation in Minnesota is a little bit different. There is a well-established independent body in Minnesota that is taking a look at the situation. Obviously, the Department of Justice is keeping tabs on it as well. But this is an investigation that's being led by State officials in Minnesota. And because of those ongoing investigations into those incidents, I just can't speak in a lot of detail about them.\nQ: Josh, I wanted to ask you about George W. Bush's inclusion in the memorial tomorrow. We now know that he was invited by the mayor. But I wanted to know, does the White House, does the President see any role for the former President to play in tackling some of these issues that you've been discussing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously former President Bush and Mrs. Bush are residents of Dallas and they're prominent members of the Dallas community. They were obviously prominent figures in that community well before he served in the White House, so he obviously has got his own personal connection to this community that's grieving. So I think for that reason it's entirely appropriate and I think even a credit to him that he has chosen to speak in this setting.\nI think it also serves as a valuable reminder that despite that well-chronicled political differences between President Bush and President Obama, that the two of them are coming together at this time. I do think it underscores something that the President said over the weekend that our country is not as divided as it might seem. And we have differences, and we articulate those differences and we litigate those differences politically in a very vigorous fashion. But when it comes to basic values about the courage and service of police officers and a commitment to the rule of law and justice, there's a lot of common ground to be found, even between two leaders that have some differing political views. But around these issues, there's plenty of common ground to be found.\nQ: And in the vein, we know that Nancy Pelosi is traveling down on Air Force One tomorrow. Has the White House extended an invitation to the Republican leadership in Congress to travel as well?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that a number of invitations to congressional leaders have been extended by the White House to travel to Dallas on Air Force One. I don't have a list to walk through with you right now. I know that a number of members of Congress are still making their travel plans. So we'll have more details about who will accompany the President to Dallas tomorrow.\nQ: And on the thought process behind the writing. I know he's spending, as you said, the majority of the day today. Is he doing the first draft? Can you take us a little bit more behind the scenes on who he's calling on, who he's asking for help in writing his speech? Is he making calls outside of the building, or is it just with his team of speechwriters?\nMR. EARNEST: The President does have a team of speechwriters here at the White House with whom he has been able to collaborate quite effectively on previous speeches of this sort. And I think it should be evident to those of you who were closely watching the President's comments over the last four or five days here, that he's got his own deeply rooted personal feelings on this topic. So the President does have a very good sense of what he wants to say. And he'll be supported by a team of speechwriters that will help him put that down on paper.\nThat said, I don't want to underestimate or downplay how difficult it is for the President to appear in a setting like this. The President would tell you that he wished that he weren't called on so often to give these kinds of speeches, comforting those who are the surviving family members of the victims of gun violence. We've seen a lot of that lately -- too much of it, in the President's mind. But the President understands that this is what the President of the United States is called on to do, and the President embraces that responsibility, takes it quite seriously, and I think will be up to the task when he speaks tomorrow.\nQ: Can I just follow up on that? He's obviously done a number of these -- Newtown, Charleston, Fort Hood twice. What is different about the process of preparing for a speech like this, a memorial to the victims of a mass shooting, than any of his other major speeches?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think certainly one distinguishing feature of this tragedy is the fact that the lives that were claimed were law enforcement officers. These were individuals who signed up to serve their community. They voluntarily pinned the badge to their chest because they're so committed to serving and protecting the community of Dallas and the people of Dallas. And to see those lives claimed in this hateful act is tragic. So that certainly adds some poignancy to this situation.\nBut, look, each of the events that you named were poignant in their own way, but I think what is also true about this situation, Jon, is that there's a backdrop here that -- there are people all across the country, again, of all races, who are grieving the loss of these innocent lives, these police officers in Dallas who were gunned down on Thursday night. But there's anxiety across the country about the shootings we saw in two other communities of black men by police officers. And the President senses that anxiety across the country as well. And he senses the frustration, again, that I think -- that doesn't exist solely in the black community, but I think that exists in the minds and hearts and conscience of fair-minded Americans of all races. And I would expect the President to touch on that as well.\nQ: Has he spoken to President Bush in advance of this? Or does he intend to when he gets down there?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has spoken to President Bush in the last few days. But obviously the two men will have an opportunity to visit when they're in Dallas, and I know the President is genuinely looking forward to that. Periodically, their paths have crossed over the course of the presidency, and we've talked in here a lot about the respect that President Obama has for the way that President Bush managed the transition between their two presidencies and the way that he's conducted himself in the post-presidency. I think the President is deeply appreciative and deeply respectful of that. And I feel confident in telling you that he's looking forward to seeing President Bush and Mrs. Bush tomorrow.\nQ: Was the last time they spoke in Selma?\nMR. EARNEST: I was about to say that. I think that is true. I can't say that definitively. And the reason for that is simply that we have not read out every conversation that the President has with former Presidents; that's one channel of private communication that we do try to protect for its privacy.\nBut I can tell you that I'm not aware, at least off the top of my head here, of a conversation that President Obama has had with President Bush since they crossed paths in Selma last spring.\nMike.\nQ: Looking abroad, what's the President's reaction to British Prime Minister David Cameron's decision to move up his departure, and the choice of Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, obviously, President Obama had an opportunity to visit with Prime Minister Cameron at the NATO Summit in Warsaw over the weekend. The two leaders sat next to each other for hours on end at that summit, so I know they had an opportunity to have a number of conversations.\nI'm not aware at that point, however, that Prime Minister Cameron shared his plans with President Obama. I've learned a lot about the British political process in just the last few hours, so it's my understanding that having one of the two competitors for the leadership of the conservative party drop out essentially made the choice a foregone conclusion.\nSo my understanding is that there are some ceremonial steps that have to take place here. Ultimately, this is a British political process that will follow the guidelines that are in place. The President continues, though, to rest on the principle that the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is a special one, and it is a relationship that transcends the personalities or political parties of either country's leader. And if, in fact, Theresa May is the next Prime Minister of the UK, the President is entirely confident that he and his successor will be able to coordinate effectively with her to not just protect, but even advance the special relationship between our two countries.\nQ: Has the President met the Home Secretary? What's his impression of her?\nMR. EARNEST: The only reason I know this -- the answer to that is yes. I don't know that they've had a detailed conversation. I know that she participated in the extended bilateral meeting President Obama had with Prime Minister Cameron in London when he was there earlier this spring. I only know that because I met her in the context of that meeting. But I don't know that they've had an extended conversation before.\nQ: The President was speaking conditionally about Brexit recently. Like in the Canada press conference, he was saying \"if\" Briton withdraws from the EU. One of the first comments to Home Secretary made after being chosen to be Prime Minister was, \"Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make it a success.\" Does the President now view Brexit as a certainty?\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, the President's views on this have not changed. As you know -- as you pointed out, he's spoken at length on this and he's talked --\nQ: -- he said \"if.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there have been some who have picked that out. I think what is also true is the President has talked about it in a way that has been non-conditional. So our expectation is that the Brexit process will be one that will commence when leaders in the UK invoke Article 50 of the EU charter, and that will precipitate a negotiation between UK officials and EU officials.\nAnd our hope and expectation is that that is a negotiation that will take place in an orderly fashion in a way that should not unduly disrupt the economies of either place, of either Europe or the UK -- the EU and the UK. Because what we know is that there is obviously an important economic relationship between the UK and the EU now, and even once Article 50 has been invoked there will continue to be an important economic relationship across the Channel. So it's in the interests of both sides to ensure that that negotiation is orderly. And the President certainly has confidence that that's what both sides will pursue.\nQ: Last question. Despite all this epic uncertainty around the world, the U.S. stock market's benchmark, the S&P 500 at an all-time high today. What's the President's reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, we don't respond to -- react to specific movements in the market. There are highly paid analysts, including at your network, who can opine on that, so I'll defer to them. I will, however, note something that did not get a lot of attention -- understandably so -- at the end of last week, which is that we got a very favorable jobs report from the Department of Labor about the condition of the labor market in the United States. It continues to be strong and the envy of the rest of the world.\nSo the President's view is that we need to look for ways that we can build on that momentum. But when it comes to individual market movements, I'll let your high-paid analysts take care of that.\nChip -- nice to see you today.\nQ: Good to see you. Two things -- there's been a lot of progress in race relations in recent decades. And I think most Americans would agree with that. But I think most Americans would probably also -- or at least a lot of Americans -- would agree with former Philadelphia and D.C. Police Commissioner who said -- Charles Ramsey -- who said this weekend, \"We are sitting on a powder keg right now.\" Do you think the President would agree with that assessment that we're sitting on a powder keg? And how disappointed or mystified is he that it happened during his presidency. This is a person who came into office thinking he could heal race relations, but things seem to have gone in the other direction.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think even when the President was coming into office and he was filled with so much optimism about the direction of the country -- and continues to be filled with that optimism -- I think even then, the President was realistic about the legacy of race relations in America and the generations' worth of work that remains to be done to address that legacy, and the consequences that it has had for our society.\nBut, again, there's no denying that we've made important progress. As it relates to the situation right now, I haven't asked the President that direct question, but I think it would be a mistake to downplay the acute concern that's being felt not just by minorities in the United States but by large segments of the white community, too, about these persistent racial disparities in law enforcement.\nThere are steps that we can take to address those disparities, and there are steps that we can take to begin to repair the bonds of trust that in too many communities have eroded between law enforcement and the citizens they are sworn to serve and protect. And the President believes that it's too easy for those solutions to fall on the priority list. And, look, local officials have a lot of responsibilities, wide-ranging responsibilities. The President believes that this is one that's worth focusing on. It's one that we should be conscientious about even when it's not in the headlines.\nAnd the reason for that is that we only make progress in this area through tenacious implementation of some of these solutions, and it requires persistence and determination to see them through. But, again, there's no better example than Dallas in terms of the results of their efforts. For several years, they were dogged, they have been dogged in implementing some of these reforms and being more transparent in reforming the training methods, in increasing training requirements. And all of that did lead to a situation where there was improved trust between the minority community and the police department. There were many fewer reports of excessive force used. There were many fewer -- we've seen a significant decline in police-involved shootings. And all of that took place at the same time that the Dallas community was benefitting from historically low crime rates.\nAnd I think the President is pretty confident that's not a coincidence -- that we can enhance the effectiveness of crime fighters if they are trusted by the community. So the President believes that's a priority worth focusing on, and I can assure you that that's something that his administration will continue to be focused on in the months ahead.\nQ: One quickly. Do you know if the President saw Dallas Police Chief David Brown's amazingly plainspoken press conference earlier today?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that he saw it earlier today, but I know the President has been reading some of the coverage of Chief Brown's appearance and has been quite impressed by his grace under fire.\nQ: Is he going to meet with him?\nMR. EARNEST: I would expect the President will have an opportunity to at least see him when he's in Dallas tomorrow. I don't know if they'll have time for an extended meeting, but I would expect that the President will compliment him on the steady leadership that he has shown under unimaginably difficult circumstances.\nAlexis.\nQ: -- speech or his remarks tomorrow and also the meeting at the White House. There are critics of the President who have said that when the President starts talking about gun safety or gun control, that listening stops and polarization and divisions arise. I know the President doesn't agree with that, but can we expect to hear him talk about gun safety or gun control or gun legislation in the remarks tomorrow or Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just start by saying I can't offer a detailed preview of what the President will cover and won't cover in his remarks tomorrow. We'll see if we can get you some better guidance in advance of the speech -- I can't promise, though, that I'll be able to do that.\nBut the President did have an opportunity to talk about this at some point over the weekend. I believe it may have been in his news conference on Saturday where he was asked a similar question. And you said in your question that when the President mentions gun control that he's often accused by his critics of politicizing the situation and people have a tendency to sort of tune him out. And you said the President disagrees with that.\nI don't think the President disagrees with that. I think he is keenly aware that there are politicians in Washington, D.C. that when it comes to significant incidents of gun violence, that they close their eyes and they hold their ears and they wish it away. They hope that people won't notice. The President is well aware of that for one reason, and one reason only, which is that is the chief impediment to us making progress on this issue. If there were a willingness to just try to focus on some common-sense things, we could make some progress on gun violence in this country.\nThe President has never made the case -- and I certainly have never made the case -- that there are common-sense things that can be done to eliminate every single act of gun violence in America. That won't happen. And the President is aware of that.\nBut the President's view is if there are some common-sense steps that can be taken that don't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, then why wouldn't we do it. And the only reason we don't do it is because when someone -- whenever anyone even raises that prospect, whenever someone even mentions it, they're criticized and accused of politicizing the situation. And that's unfortunate.\nBut the President is quite aware of this phenomenon and he finds it intensely frustrating -- and again, not just because he's the subject of criticism -- he's been doing this for a while now and I don't think he's particularly offended or wounded by that criticism. But he's intensely frustrated that it is preventing the kind of rational, common-sense conversation that is part and parcel of a reasonable solution.\nAnd in this case, it's tragic that we've not been able to reach this reasonable solution because innocent people are dying. Innocent people are losing their lives because of the refusal of the United States Congress to even have this conversation. The House of Representatives -- Republicans in the House of Representatives won't even vote on it. So we're not even to the conversation -- to the part of the conversation where we say, oh, they should support this. We're at the part of the conversation where we're trying to convince Republicans in the House of Representatives that they should even have a debate on it. That is the debate that they've refused to have -- they've refused to have votes.\nAnd again, it's not just the President who is frustrated by that. I think you've seen rather notable expressions of frustration from House Democrats who would like to see that situation change in the House of Representatives. And I think they're only reflecting the views of people all across the country who share that frustration.\nAnd, again, the kinds of proposals that we're talking about are not controversial ones. These are proposals that are not -- that do enjoy the strong support of a majority of Democrats, a majority of Republicans and, in most cases, a majority of gun owners even support the kinds of measures that Democrats are advocating for.\nQ: Based on what you were just saying, can we pretty much guarantee that the NRA will be invited to be here at the White House on Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, there are a number of occasions where the NRA has been invited to participate in White House events and they've turned down that opportunity. The most recent example I can think of is the President convened a town hall meeting that was organized by some of your colleagues at CNN. There were a diversity of views represented at that town hall meeting. That event took place probably within walking distance -- I guess if you were willing to spend a couple hours -- just a couple miles from NRA Headquarters, and they turned down an invitation to participate in that event.\nSo I don't know whether or not they'll be invited on Wednesday, but we'll do what we can to try to get you a list of people who do participate.\nQ: And one other follow-up. The Washington Post, in the series that they have been running called Fatal Force, with all the statistics that they have spent time pulling together, have indicated that, based on the statistics, this year, cameras, video cameras of all kinds -- body cameras, whatever -- have had no deterrent effect at all on the statistics they've seen of police shootings this year. Does the President continue to believe that body cameras -- video, Facebook Live -- that they function as a deterrent? Or is that an open question in his mind?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding is that there is some research to substantiate the claim that at least when it comes to body-worn cameras that it does have an impact on reducing the frequency of violence in interactions between law enforcement and citizens. I vaguely recall one study that had been conducted in a city in Arizona, I believe, that did show that there was a reduction in reports of the use of excessive force in interactions between law enforcement and members of the community.\nSo I think what the President would say is that when it comes to the academic research, there's probably some more work that needs to be done to verify exactly what impact and how significant an impact those cameras could have. I think there is some speculation that even if the impact is not measurable yet, there is an intuitive impact on enhancing trust between law enforcement officers and members of the community; that you could imagine it gives the police department the opportunity to be more transparent when conducting investigations into individual incidents, for example.\nIn some cases, that evidence can be used to highlight the heroic work of law enforcement officers. But I think that it also serves to give some members of the community confidence in those relationships and in those interactions. And that may be the kind of impact that is not measurable in the short term, but it could be worthwhile in trying to address this other question that's a little harder to measure.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned that there are racial disparities in our own criminal justice system and that local officials have a lot of things to deal with -- a lot of responsibilities -- and that there are limits on how much the federal government and federal officials can be involved in these types of things. Does the White House believe that the federal government should play a greater role in local policing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it's a long tradition in our country for these kinds of law enforcement activities to be organized at the local level, and I think there's some good, common-sense reasons for that. So this administration has not been a part of advocating that somehow more local law enforcement efforts should be organized by the federal government. Rather, we are encouraging local law enforcement agencies to avail themselves of the resources of the federal government based on the experience of other local law enforcement organizations.\nSo, essentially, the work of this task force was done by going around and visiting communities all across the country. Many of the people who were on task force, I would point out, were not federal officials but were people who had expertise in their own right. They were either civil rights activists, academics. And Chief Ramsey, who was the chief of police here in Washington and Philadelphia -- and he was mentioned earlier -- was one of the leaders of that task force.\nSo this work was done by people who have their own relevant expertise. And what the federal government essentially did was served to convene these individuals, give them a forum for doing this work and generating this report, and then using our relationships with law enforcement agencies all across the country to communicate the findings and make sure that people are aware of what these reforms and what these best practices have yielded in other communities, and tried to use that to encourage local communities to pursue the same kinds of reforms. A significant number of local communities have. But --\nQ: But what we've seen in the last week doesn't prompt a desire in the White House or a call in the White House to mandate certain --\nMR. EARNEST: No, our position on that hasn't changed. There's a well-established tradition in America for many of these law enforcement activities to be organized at the local level, and there are a lot of good reasons for that.\nQ: You were talking a bit about body cameras. Would the White House embrace efforts to require police wear body cameras? And that does get into what we were just discussing.\nMR. EARNEST: No, what we have found is that I know that there a number of law enforcement agencies that do think that body-worn cameras are a good idea, but yet they don't have the resources to pay for those cameras. And so what the federal government has been chiefly doing is trying to mobilize resources to help local law enforcement agencies make that purchase and make that investment.\nWe've also tried to, again, work with law enforcement agencies that have been able to use video from body-worn cameras and policies related to body-worn cameras, to have an impact on their communities, and make sure that other communities are aware of how they can best implement this new technology to maximize the benefit associated with it. So offering that kind of practical advice and expertise is another appropriate role for the federal government to play, and I know that that's one that some local communities have expressed an appreciation for.\nQ: Responding to President Obama's comments from this weekend -- he did catch some criticism on the right and the left. An example -- William Johnson of the National Association of Police Organizations, a union, says the President should criticize the entire Black Lives Matter movement, and not doing so only encourages violence against police officers. On the other end, Cornel West says the President is essentially too deferential to the police and needs to be more critical of police departments. Will the President address that criticism tomorrow, or at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, I think anybody who was interested in understanding exactly what the President's views on this topic were, or are, would take a close look at the remarks that President Obama delivered when we arrived in Warsaw late on Thursday night. In those remarks, the President -- these are remarks, by the way, that took place -- the President delivered hours before the shootings in Dallas. But in the context of talking about his concern about persistent racial disparities in America, the President talked about the everyday heroism of men and women in law enforcement. He talked about the fact that they put their lives on the line every single day to protect us, and that the vast majority of those men and women do an outstanding job. They are faithful to the commitment that they have made to serve and protect those communities where they work. The President also said that we mourn the lives that are lost while protecting us -- a tragically prescient line.\nThe President also reaffirmed something that he said in his State of the Union address back in 2015, where he talked about the right of law enforcement officers to go home at the end of the shift. All of this before the strong feelings that were aroused by the tragic shootings in Dallas.\nAnd the reason that the President decided to deliver those remarks is because he did want to articulate the fact of the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system. And he ticked through a variety of statistics -- not just from one source, but from a variety of sources -- about that reality and about how that reality leaves some people feeling like they're not being treated the same just because of the color of their skin. And the President affirmed that fair-minded people of all races should be, and are, rightly concerned about that situation.\nSo all these questions that we've been facing and asking ourselves in the aftermath of the Dallas shooting about racial disparities in our criminal justice system, about the need to support our men and women in law enforcement, about the fact that the vast majority of our men and women in law enforcement do an outstanding job every day -- these are all things that the President of the United States said hours before the shooting took place.\nSo, again, I think any sort of fair-minded person who's interested in understanding what the President actually believes about all this has a good way to figure that out. And that's simply to listen to what the President had to say when he arrived in Warsaw late on Thursday night, just hours before the shooting in Dallas.\nQ: And finally, if you add up the number -- this is by a couple of measures -- the number of mass shootings under the previous two-term Presidents, and you combine them, it's about what President Obama has been in office for. What is the White House assessment of why that is and what's going on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, I haven't seen those statistics, so maybe that's something we can look at more carefully. I think the President has had far too many occasions, unfortunately, to talk about gun violence and the flood of guns on our streets. And he's been disappointed that Congress hasn't been able to take some common-sense steps to try to address that problem.\nOne other angle -- there are so many arguments that make the position that is taken by the NRA and their supporters in the Congress so unreasonable and so illogical and, frankly, dangerous, given the fact that their refusal to act actually does increase the risk that innocent people face. But the argument that we often see from those in those quarters is that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. The fact is, because of the open carry laws in Texas, on Thursday night in Dallas, there were a whole lot of people carrying guns -- not just police officers. There were innocent people who were, understandably, by law enforcement, who were detained and arrested because they were considered suspects -- and reasonably so.\nWhen police officers are taking fire, somebody walking around with an assault weapon is a suspect. And I actually think it is a testament to the courage and professionalism of the men and women of the Dallas Police Department that they didn't shoot any innocent people. There were all sorts of suspects in front of them. The justification that's often used for the use of deadly force is, well, that person had a gun.\nSo I think it is another illustration of how indefensible the position is of the NRA and their supporters in Congress. But it also is another testament to the bravery and courage in a terrible situation by men and women of the Dallas Police Department and the men and women of the other local law enforcement agencies that were on duty that night.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, tomorrow the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold a hearing on the First Amendment Defense Act, a religious freedom bill that critics say would enable anti-LGBT discrimination. Tomorrow is also the one-month anniversary of the Orlando shooting, which, as you know, claimed the lives of 49 people and wounded 53 others at a gay nightclub. Should the committee cancel the hearing?\nMR. EARNEST: Chris, I have to admit I'm not aware of the hearing at all, and I'm not sure what bill they're planning to consider, and I don't know anything about the bill. So why don't you see if I can collect more information for you and we'll come back to you.\nLet's see. In the back -- just in the back. Pam, why don't you go ahead?\nQ: Three more inmates have been transferred out of Guantanamo Bay. How many left -- do you have the current number of how many left have been approved for transfer? And does the administration expect to get them all out to other countries by the time the President leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: To answer your direct question first, Pam, there were three individuals who were transferred from the prison at Guantanamo Bay in the last few days. I believe that two of those individuals were transferred to Serbia. One of those individuals was transferred to Italy. That brings the total population of the prison at Guantanamo Bay down to 76.\nThe individuals who were transferred were transferred based on the unanimous recommendation of the President's national security team and based on the personal certification of the Secretary of Defense that the necessary security requirements were in place in Serbia and Italy respectively to ensure that these individuals don't pose an undue threat to our national security here.\nAnd this is consistent with the President's strategy that we're going to continue to do everything possible to try to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and the first step in that is trying to reduce the prison population there. And by working effectively with our, in this case, two NATO allies of the United States, to do that, we're using our diplomatic influence and our security know-how to accomplish that goal. And that goal is motivated by the President's conclusion that to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open only gives a rhetorical weapon to terrorists that we know use the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruitment tool.\nWe also know that it's a big waste of money; that detaining these dangerous individuals could be done in a much more cost-effective fashion in facilities in the United States that in some cases already house hardened, convicted terrorists.\nSo the President is continuing to push on this, and we're steadily making progress. I'll just remind you that at the beginning of the administration, there were 242 detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and the prison population now is down to 76. So we've made a lot of important progress, but we've still got some work to do.\nQ: Are you on track to transfer those who have been approved to leave?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's hard to say that we're on track, because the way this process works is we have to go and negotiate with individual countries to reach the necessary agreements to transfer these individuals. So I can't say that we've got a commitment from other countries to take every single one of the individuals that's been approved for transfer, but this is work that's going on every day behind the scenes, and we're working to secure those commitments so that we can succeed in those transfers.\nQ: Does the U.S. have to offer anything to these countries to take these guys? Or are they doing it because they want to be on the good side of the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a lot of these countries would say that they recognize that the national security of the United States and our other NATO allies, at least in this instance, is enhanced if we can close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. So I think they've got -- I think what we can assess about their motives is that they're consistent with the interests that the United States has in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks. You were looking at me earlier and I was -- (laughter) -- but all I wanted to know is about Zika funding, and whether you've gotten any indications from the Hill that they might increase that Zika funding. And when exactly do you run out of money for Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Cheryl, we continue to be deeply concerned that Republicans in Congress are not working in bipartisan fashion to confront what our public health professionals have described as an emergency. It's a legitimate emergency. And the Zika virus does pose a significant threat to pregnant women and newborn babies in the United States. And because of congressional inaction, our public health professionals say that they're not able to do every single thing that they would like to do to protect us.\nAnd I can't really articulate why this should be a partisan issue. I don't think Republicans can either. I do think it reflects failed leadership on their part that here were are almost five months later -- the President put forward a specific request for these resources based on the recommendation he received from public health professionals almost five months ago, and yet we've seen Republicans struggle to actually work in bipartisan fashion to solve this problem. Instead, they'd rather play games with pay-fors, which is merely frustrating when it comes to other priorities that the President has identified, but when it comes to a public health emergency, it's unconscionable.\nI've been saying this for five months, though, so I don't know what kind of impact that's going to have on Republicans. The President has been saying this -- I know that there are Republican governors and Republican officials who do represent some states that are at event greater risk from the Zika virus who are making the same case. Marco Rubio, somebody with whom I do not often agree, is an enthusiastic supporter of the $1.9 billion package that our public health professionals say that we need. But that hasn't succeeded in persuading enough of his fellow Republicans to support that proposal. And that's deeply disappointing. It does put vulnerable populations of Americans at risk, and Republicans are going to have to explain at some point why.\nQ: But if Congress leaves at the end of this week without any Zika funding passed, what happens? I mean, do you literally run out of money?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the thing that we do know happens is that Congress is prepared to go on a seven or eight-week recess here and they'll be doing so essentially at the peak of mosquito season. So I think what we can say will happen is that there will be communities that are not doing as much spraying of mosquitos as they'd like to do. There are laboratory facilities that won't be able to process diagnostic tests as quickly as they would like to help people get answers and protect themselves from the Zika virus. We know that there will be doctors who won't be able to give out or administer a Zika test as widely as they would like.\nIn short, we won't be able to do everything that our public health professionals say they would like to do to try to protect people from the Zika virus. And it will be up to Republicans to explain why exactly that's the case.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. Tomorrow, Senator Bernie Sanders will be up in New Hampshire. He'll be in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He'll be campaigning with Hillary Clinton. Is the President pleased to see such unity in the Democratic Party? And also, on the flip side, is he pleased to see such apparent disunity within the Republican Party?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as you know, President Obama did have an opportunity to meet with Senator Sanders -- I guess this was last month now -- to talk about the race to succeed President Obama. And you've heard the President himself articulate on a number of occasions how important it is for the Democratic Party to come together behind the effort to support a candidate that's committed to the kinds of values and priorities that this President has been fighting for.\nAnd from supporting the Affordable Care Act to supporting tough Wall Street reform, to supporting the effort to mobilize the international community to fight climate change, to uphold the agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, to go and fight for civil rights for all Americans, to fight for equal pay for women -- these are all values that are broadly shared by the Democrats across the country. They're shared by the two presidential candidates. And these are the values that have animated President Obama's tenure in the White House. And he's determined to make sure that the person who takes the keys to the White House is somebody who wants to build on the progress that we've made in pursuit of those values over the last seven and a half years.\nSo the President has been quite candid about his interest, and so I guess what I can tell you is that he's pleased to see that development. But he'll obviously have quite a bit more to say about this over the course of the next four months or so.\nThanks a lot, everybody.\nEND 3:45 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117993", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(H.R. 5631 – House Rules)\n(H.R. 4992 – Rep. McCarthy, R-CA)\n(H.R. 5119 – Rep. Royce, R-CA, and 14 cosponsors)\n(Rep. Pompeo, R-KS, and 32 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992, and H.R. 5119, bills that would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA – the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key aspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments.\nH.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain U.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity by Iran. Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals and entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and economic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent Iranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector. In addition, this bill lacks flexibility including new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions measures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy objectives.\nH.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran and the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system. This would amount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority. As the Administration has been clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. financial system from access by Iran. However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's conduct of banking transactions outside of the United States – activity that became permissible on Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by the IAEA.\nH.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy water from Iran in the future. Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to material that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing the international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear industries. As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it could accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this product to develop material for a nuclear weapon. The United States does not produce heavy water. For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical and diagnostic research – such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development – as well as for chemistry, physics and environmental analysis.\nThese bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our commitments to our closest allies.\nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains all of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies. In addition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement of their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral export controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).\nContinued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants – including the United States and our closest allies – is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community.\nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 4992, H.R. 5119, or H.R. 5631, he would veto these bills.", "timestamp": "2016-07-11", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5631 – Iran Accountability Act of 2016, H.R. 4992 – United States Financial System Protection Act of 2016, & H.R. 5119 – No 2H2O from Iran Act"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117999", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5538, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nThe bill underfunds core Department of the Interior (DOI) programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) operating budget, which supports nationwide protection of human health, and vital air, water and land resources. The funding levels in the bill would significantly hamper investments that reduce future costs to taxpayers by facilitating increased energy development, ensuring adequate levels of cybersecurity, and maintaining operations, facilities and infrastructure in national parks, refuges, forests, public lands, and Indian Country. These reductions would make it more difficult for States and businesses to plan and execute changes that would decrease carbon pollution and address the challenges facing the Nation from climate change. They would also reduce support for partnerships and effective collaboration with States, Tribes, local governments, and private entities on efforts to restore and conserve natural and cultural resources. Furthermore, the legislation includes numerous highly unacceptable provisions that have no place in funding legislation. These provisions threaten to undermine the most basic protections for America's unique natural treasures and the people and wildlife that rely on them, as well as the ability of States and communities to address climate change and protect a resource that is essential to America's health—clean water.\nDespite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in EPA's water infrastructure financing programs, including the State Revolving Funds for clean water and drinking water projects and the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan program. In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's investments in Indian Country, sagebrush ecosystem conservation, and National Park Service operations, though the Congress is encouraged to fully fund the requested increases in these areas.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5538, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDepartment of the Interior (DOI)\nIndian Affairs Priorities.The Administration appreciates the funding level for Indian Affairs programs as a whole. However, although the bill provides full funding for Contract Support Costs, and increases for the Tiwahe Initiative and important Indian Education programs, the bill does not include funding to address fundamental needs in Indian Country. The bill fails to provide for much needed basic access to broadband and digital services in Indian schools, adequately facilitate access to Federal programs through a Native One-Stop Support Center, or strengthen data quality in Indian Country. Further, it fails to help tribal communities manage natural resources, prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change, and support resolution of tribal land and water claims.\nOil and Gas Inspection Fees.The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not include the FY 2017 Budget request to institute a new onshore oil and gas inspection fee program. The program, which is similar to the program already in place for offshore operations, would cover the cost of onshore inspection activities and reduce by $48 million the net cost to taxpayers of operating Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas program. Failure to adopt the new fees and associated funding would restrict BLM's ability to protect human safety, conserve energy resources, facilitate the proper reporting of oil and gas production, and ensure environmental requirements are being followed in all phases of development. The bill also fails to include a proposed change to the Bureau of Safety and Environment Enforcement's inspection fee structure, which is necessary to ensure Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) operations are conducted safely and responsibly.\nPayments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT). The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes $480 million in discretionary resources for PILT, which the FY 2017 Budget request funds through a separate mandatory appropriation. Inclusion of these discretionary funds in the bill comes at the expense of all other programs funded by the bill.\nRestrictions on the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Administration strongly opposes sections 114, 118, 119, and 445 of the bill, which would undermine the ESA and limit the ability of the Fish and Wildlife Service to properly protect important species and habitats based on the best available science, including the greater sage grouse, lesser prairie chicken, delta smelt, and certain gray wolf populations. Notably, the bill would circumvent established law, Federal process, and in some cases, judicial precedent. These language provisions would create uncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to collaboratively conserve landscapes in concert with local ways of life. Furthermore, the Administration strongly opposes sections 447 through 451 of the bill regarding management of water flows in California which would undercut the ESA, preempt California water law, fail to address critical elements of California's complex water challenges and impede an effective and timely response to the continuing drought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities. These provisions could slow decision-making, generate significant litigation, and limit real-time operational flexibility critical to maximizing water delivery. As the Administration stated in the past, these provisions were developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key stakeholders affected by the drought. The urgency and seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.\nStream Protection Rule.The Administration strongly opposes section 120 of the bill, which would prohibit the DOI's Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement (OSMRE) from finalizing or implementing the proposed Stream Protection Rule. This rule would update 30-year old stream protection regulations to reflect modern science and technology and better protect people and the environment, provide industry more certainty, and address recent court decisions. The current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities rely on outdated scientific knowledge and mining and reclamation techniques. The bill's attempt to block modern, science-based regulations would significantly impair the ability of OSMRE to accomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress laid out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, including preserving clean water and protecting human health and the environment. In addition, the bill would undermine environmental protections, prevent the restoration of hundreds of streams, result in the deterioration of water quality for thousands of stream miles, create sustained regulatory uncertainty, and negatively impact public health for downstream communities.\nOil, Gas, and Coal Operations. The Administration strongly opposes sections 122, 127, 440, and 441 of the bill which would undermine BLM's basic administrative authority to effectively oversee onshore fossil energy production on public lands. Section 122 of the bill would prohibit BLM from regulating flaring, venting and leaks of methane from Federal onshore oil and gas operations; this effectively prevents BLM from using Mineral Leasing Act authority to reduce waste and improve fair return to the tax payer. Section 440 of the bill infringes upon BLM's authority to adjust royalty rates where appropriate. In addition, section 441 of the bill short-circuits the Administration's recently-announced comprehensive review of the Federal coal leasing program, thus impeding the Administration's ability to ensure a fair return to taxpayers from Federal coal development. Section 127 of the bill prevents the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management from finalizing a rule on the air quality impacts from OCS oil and gas operations.\nBureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) Offshore Well Control Rule.The Administration strongly opposes section 124 of the bill, which prohibits BSEE from developing, adopting, implementing, administering, or enforcing requirements pertaining to drilling safety margins, which represent a key provision of the BSEE's recently finalized Well Control Rule addressing drilling safety on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. This prohibition would fundamentally undermine BSEE's role in overseeing OCS oil and gas operations, including efforts to reduce the risk of a catastrophic loss of well control such as the one that led to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the rescission of BSEE's unobligated balances would prevent BSEE from meeting its safety and environmental protection responsibilities on behalf of the American public.\nNational Monument Restrictions. The Administration strongly opposes section 453 of the bill, which would prohibit the President from exercising his authority under the Antiquities Act to designate national monuments in certain counties within eight States. This would debilitate a successful program that has been used to protect areas critical to the Nation's natural and cultural heritage such as Bandelier National Monument and the Statue of Liberty.\nBLM Planning 2.0. The Administration strongly opposes section 443 of the bill, which would significantly delay BLM from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing its Planning 2.0 rulemaking to improve BLM's land use planning. This delay would prevent BLM from finalizing a rule that supports Administration goals of facilitating science-based, landscape-level planning with early public involvement.\nHunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting. The Administration strongly opposes limits on the closure of land management areas to hunting, which infringe upon the authority of BLM's field managers and fail to provide the public sufficient time or flexibility to develop effective long-term solutions at the local level to address long-term resource conflicts, resource protection needs, and public safety issues associated with recreational target shooting.\nWater Rights. The Administration strongly opposes section 433 of the bill, which would restrict the use of funds to implement water rights administration and management by the Federal Government. This language is unnecessary for its intended purpose, and would preclude land management agencies from protecting the public interest. This provision would eliminate the ability of land management agencies to maintain sufficient water for other congressionally-designated purposes and ensure water rights are tied to the activities for which they were developed. These restrictions would also hamper cooperative work with land users to improve land conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat mitigation activities as part of land use agreements.\nNational Historic Preservation Act. The Administration opposes section 123 of the bill, which would allow Federal agencies to object to a designation of Federal properties for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Listing a property on the National Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not limit any Federal agency's decision-making authority. Decisions on how to manage the property, informed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the agency with jurisdiction over that property. The Administration is not aware of any specific instance where such a designation has adversely affected national security. Enactment of this section could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired programs that recognize and protect the Nation's shared heritage.\nFederal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes Rule.The Administration opposes section 125 of the bill, which would block DOI from implementing, administering, or enforcing the final Federal acknowledgment rule. The final rule makes much needed changes to the previous rules criticized by Tribes and the Congress as in need of reform. These important changes were made in consultation with and at the request of Tribes, States, local governments, and the public. Blocking this rule leaves the Federal acknowledgement program without a governing structure, effectively halting the Administration's role in the process. To uphold the principle of tribal sovereignty, it is important that the Federal Government have a clear and objective process to determine which Tribes it recognizes. Administrative recognition provides an orderly process.\nLand into Trust. The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to address the need to clarify and reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire land in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). In Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme Court held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under IRA only for Tribes that were \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934. The Administration continues to support language requested in the FY 2017 Budget to extend this authority to all Tribes, whether recognized in 1934 or later. Such legislation would be consistent with the longstanding policy of assisting Tribes in establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to allow them to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of tribal members, and in treating all Tribes equally for purposes of setting aside lands for tribal communities. Section 128 of the bill takes a far more limited approach, however, simply reaffirming that certain land taken into trust before the Carcieri decision shall continue to be trust land.\nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service\nWildland Fire Suppression. The Administration is deeply disappointed that the Committee did not take a stronger position toward the enactment of a cap adjustment for wildfire suppression in this bill, and instead, focused on the inclusion of a provision that is potentially disruptive of the environmental analysis required under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Administration's cap adjustment proposal is a fiscally responsible strategy to provide discretionary resources for suppression of 98 percent of wildland fires with 70 percent of the 10-year average cost in base appropriations. This includes a disaster funding cap adjustment to meet suppression needs for the remaining two percent of fires that become catastrophic in size and cost and consume 30 percent of suppression resources. Continued inaction on this proposal, which has bipartisan support, would increase the likelihood of disruptive fire transfers in future years and harm all other Forest Service Programs. Passage of the proposal is of paramount concern for the Administration in order to protect programs that pre-emptively reduce fire risk and future fire costs by restoring the health of forests and watersheds.\nLand and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).The Administration objects to the drastic reduction of $129 million, or 27 percent, from the discretionary funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget for DOI and USDA LWCF programs. LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal conservation and recreation conservation efforts. This funding level would severely impede agency capacity to further protect the Nation's natural heritage. To date, LWCF has contributed to the protection of key public lands, such as Olympic National Park, Everglades National Park, and important assets in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, among others, as well as State and local recreation projects and important cultural heritage sites.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nOperating Budget.The Administration strongly opposes the $399 million reduction of EPA's operating budget, or 11 percent, compared to the FY 2017 Budget request. This unacceptable reduction in funding would significantly undermine key actions to address climate change and improve air quality. In particular, the bill would inhibit EPA's ability to implement commonsense standards and voluntary programs, provide timely guidance and technical assistance to State and tribal air agencies, improve flexibility and enhance partnership with the States, support communities in efforts to combat localized effects of air pollution, and continue making progress toward eliminating the State implementation plan backlog. Further, this funding level would significantly reduce EPA's ability to enforce and oversee critical environmental protections for air, water, and land, including decreased capacity to find and develop civil and criminal cases against companies and individuals responsible for contaminating the environment. The funding level would also severely hinder EPA's work to strengthen environmental planning efforts, educate the public about environmental risks, and address pollution in underserved communities. These reductions would also hamper some of EPA's critical geographic program efforts, including those in the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, and Southern New England Estuaries. In addition, reductions to EPA's cybersecurity funding would severely impede EPA's ability to take necessary action to protect, defend, and sustain vital information and records, including personal information.\nState Categorical Grants. The Administration opposes the $100 million reduction to the State and Tribal Categorical Grants account compared to the FY 2017 Budget request. Often, States and Tribes implement environmental programs through delegated authorities. However, the bill reduces these grants to States and Tribes, severely limiting their ability to carry out activities such as water quality permitting, air monitoring, and hazardous waste management programs. For example, the bill reduces funding for environmental information grants by $16 million, or 62 percent, compared to the FY 2017 Budget request. This reduction would hamper system modernizations through the E-Enterprise approach and the efficiencies and long-term cost savings they would bring for many of the tools needed by industry and the States, as well as ease of use by the public. In addition, the bill reduces funding for brownfields projects by $10 million compared to the FY 2017 Budget request. This reduced level of funding severely restricts opportunities for communities to revitalize their contaminated lands to improve environmental quality and spark economic redevelopment.\ne-Manifest. The Administration objects to the reduction of funding for e-Manifest development, EPA's system for electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste. While the Administration acknowledges the concern about the pace of development of e-Manifest, full funding in FY 2017 is essential to finishing the system in time for a planned launch in calendar year 2018.\nOil Spill Prevention and Preparedness. The bill fails to recognize the risks associated with the increased production of domestic oil resources by failing to provide the necessary increases for inspections, training, and compliance offered through the Inland Oil Spills Programs Account.\nHazardous Substance Superfund. The Administration objects to the reductions made to the Hazardous Substance Superfund Account. These programs ensure that polluters pay for the contamination they caused before that burden is unfairly levied upon the general tax payer, fund cleanup activities where no viable responsible party has been identified, and provide oversight and assistance to Federal agencies who are actively engaged in cleaning up sites they own or operate. Robust funding within the account is necessary to protect the public and address the release of hazardous substances.\nGreenhouse Gas Limits for Power Plants. The Administration strongly objects to section 431 of the bill, which would block the Clean Power Plan as well as carbon pollution standards for power plants promulgated under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. Although the Clean Power Plan is currently stayed pending judicial review, this provision seeks to derail this critical component of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change regardless of the outcome of judicial review. The Administration is confident the Clean Power Plan will be upheld when the courts address its merits because the Plan rests on strong scientific and legal foundations.\nClean Water Act (CWA) Jurisdiction.The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect America's water resources, which are critical to the health of American families and businesses. The Administration strongly objects to section 427 in particular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts, and prevent future efforts, to clarify the scope of CWA. This would result in significant ambiguity and regulatory uncertainty for the public.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards Ozone Rule.The Administration strongly objects to section 438 of the bill, which would delay and undermine implementation of the 2015 ozone health standard. Ozone pollution, also known as smog, has been linked to a range of adverse health effects that can lead to missed work and school days, increased hospital admissions, and premature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes. This provision would result in people living in areas with unhealthy ozone levels for additional years, delaying health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans, including the most vulnerable—children, older adults, and people with asthma. EPA's science-based air standards, which undergo rigorous public review and comment, have a proven record of success. The standards have resulted in cleaner air which has helped all Americans live longer, healthier lives in a growing economy.\nOil and Gas Methane Emissions Standards.The Administration strongly objects to section 439 of the bill, which would block commonsense standards for sources of emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds, and toxic pollutants in the oil and natural gas industry. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the United States from human activities. Not only is reducing these emissions an essential component of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change, emission reductions would also have meaningful public health benefits for Americans. This provision would also prevent EPA from providing valuable and much needed technical guidance on emissions control techniques to State, tribal, and local air agencies in moderate or above nonattainment ground-level ozone areas and the ozone transport region. It would also prevent EPA from clarifying the scope of an emissions source to provide greater certainty for the regulated community, permitting authorities, and the public.\nSocial Cost of Carbon (SCC).The Administration regards the SCC as an essential component of the rulemaking process and opposes the Congress's interference with the Interagency Working Group's (IWG) development of the SCC. The Administration strongly objects to section 436 of the bill, which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only a limited set of discount rates and \"domestic\" SCC values. This revision ignores the trans-boundary movement of carbon and climate impacts, fails to capture key costs of carbon emissions, and disrupts upcoming rules that would use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits.\nLimitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy under the Clean Air Act.The Administration strongly objects to section 434 of the bill, which would block the finalization, implementation, and enforcement of a rule to prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Domestic action to reduce use of HFCs is consistent with U.S. advocacy for addressing HFCs on a global basis, such as through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.\nClassification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral. The Administration recognizes the role that biomass can play in reducing overall net carbon emissions in the United States, including in the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board are assessing the net biogenic carbon emissions associated with the use of different biomass feedstocks for energy. The Administration strongly objects to language under the heading \"Administrative Provisions—Environmental Protection Agency\" in the bill, which would compel EPA to disregard the scientific recommendations of its own Science Advisory Board and other technical studies.\nPesticide Worker Protection Information Access. The Administration strongly objects to section 437, which would prevent implementation or enforcement of a recently published pesticide worker protection regulation, a commonsense measure that allows a worker or handler's designated representative to access required safety and hazard information for pesticides to which that worker may have been exposed. This provision unacceptably reduces at-risk individuals' access to critical job safety information.\nAquifer Exemptions. The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill under the heading \"Administrative Provisions—Environmental Protection Agency,\" which would preclude EPA from revising its regulatory criteria for aquifer exemptions involving underground injection. This provision is in conflict with existing EPA regulations and guidance, and would cause results inconsistent with the intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act by preventing EPA from being able to protect some underground sources of drinking water.\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) 108(b) Financial Assurance. The Administration objects to section 430 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and implement financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA 108(b). This provision severely limits EPA's ability to comply with the court order, abrogates EPA's responsibilities laid out in CERCLA 108(b), and passes the cost of future cleanup activities from the polluter to the taxpayer.\nLead Test Kits. The Administration objects to section 429 of the bill, which would potentially disrupt EPA's current activities under the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting rule until either EPA approves a commercially available \"improved\" lead paint test kit or solicits public comment on alternatives to current testing options. Children and developing fetuses are especially sensitive to lead exposure, and EPA's efforts to protect vulnerable populations during home renovation projects would be undermined.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\nIndian Health Service (IHS).The Administration strongly supports increased investment in IHS and commends the Committee for funding health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. However, the Administration is concerned that the funding provided for IHS is $106 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. These additional funds are needed to provide critical program increases to help close the gap in health disparities experienced by American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Administration also is concerned that section 446 would create new improper governance structures for IHS facilities.\nContract Support Costs.The Administration opposes changes made by the bill to the IHS Contract Support Costs account that removes a proviso allowing IHS to credit a contract support cost overpayment against contract support costs due in subsequent fiscal years. Without this language, IHS would need to collect contract support cost overpayments from Tribes at the end of each fiscal year. This process would be overly burdensome for both IHS and Tribes.\nOther Independent Agencies\nSmithsonian Institution. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Smithsonian's request. In particular, the reductions to the Salaries and Expenses account could force the Smithsonian to reduce programmatic activities and museum access for the public in order to cover growing fixed costs.\nOther Issues\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA Act. This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.\nU.S. Digital Service Team.The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOI and EPA to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-07-11", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5538 – Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017"}

EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One, making our way to Dallas, Texas, where the President will speak to a memorial service that's been planned by the city of Dallas to honor the memory of those police officers who were killed last Thursday evening.\nOnboard Air Force One today, the President is joined by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Texas Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Texas Congressman Marc Veasey.\nI don't have much of a preview of the President's remarks to offer. I can tell you that the President worked late into the night consulting Scripture to write the remarks. There is some material that the President's speechwriting team had prepared for him, but what you'll hear from him today largely reflects his own writing and writing that he did late into the night last night.\nBut with that, I'll do my best to answer your questions from here.\nQ: I didn't hear you -- did you say he was staying up last night reading the Bible?\nMR. EARNEST: The President worked late into the night last night consulting Scripture to write the remarks. He was able to draw on some material that his speechwriting team had prepared for him. But the remarks that the President will deliver tonight, or this afternoon, reflect his own thoughts that he put to paper last night.\nQ: Do you know what he was reading in particular?\nMR. EARNEST: Beyond consulting Scripture, I don't know what other material he drew upon for the remarks.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about Senator Cruz? Was he invited by the President? What does it say about the two political rivals traveling together at this time?\nMR. EARNEST: Senator Cruz was invited by the White House to accompany the President on Air Force One as we travel to his home state for this memorial service. At the time that our country is feeling so divided, I think it is important that the country's leaders are coming together across party lines despite significant political differences to emphasize a shared desire to unify the country. I think that's reflected in the speaking program today.\nPresident Obama will be preceded by remarks from Senator Cornyn and former President Bush. I think that is another indication that -- of something the President has been saying for some time. The President is not the only person who said this; Speaker Ryan said this quite eloquently at the end of last week, as well. Our country is not nearly as divided as it might seem. Our country is not nearly as divided as our political debates might seem. Our country is not nearly as divided as the dysfunction in Congress might make it appear. Our country is not nearly as divided as the rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail might lead some to conclude. And unfortunately, it requires moments of -- it's in moments of tragedy that this unity is revealed.\nThis is a phenomenon the President will note in his remarks.\nQ: Is the President having a conversation with Senator Cruz on the plane? And if so, can you tell us what they're talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have details of a private conversation to read out. But I'm confident that they will have a conversation on the flight.\nQ: Was a similar invitation extended to Senator Cornyn to travel with the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there were a number of Democratic and Republican members of Congress who were invited to travel with the President today. Each member of the congressional leadership had to make their own decisions about their travel arrangements. So Senator Cornyn was certainly among those invited. I don't think that his office intended it as a slight in any way for him to not join the President on the trip, and we certainly didn't interpret it that way.\nQ: Josh, the President had a meeting -- or attended a meeting yesterday with law enforcement that you referred to in the briefing yesterday. Some participants said there was a discussion about whether or not his tone had been helpful with regard to police officers, and also that he had said if the shooter had lived, that he would have been charged with a hate crime. Can you comment on those two aspects of that meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can do is speak for the President. I'll allow the representatives of law enforcement who participated in the meeting to characterize their own views.\nThe President did have an opportunity to -- well, let me start by saying that the primary purpose of the meeting, in the mind of the Vice President and his team who organized the meeting, and the President who was eager to participate, was to hear from representatives of law enforcement. The President felt it was important to once again sit down with them and hear their perspective. There's been so much debate about the very difficult job that our police officers have to do, particularly over the last week. And the President wanted to hear directly from them their perspective on that debate.\nSo that was the point of the interaction. The President did have an opportunity to once again reaffirm his strong support for the outstanding work that is done by the vast majority of police officers in this country. The President has time and again made the point that acknowledging the reality of the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system is not at all inconsistent with voicing emphatic, unwavering support for police officers who make significant sacrifices and do outstanding work in protecting the American people. The President made that very point in public comments he made to some of you just hours before the shooting in Dallas. And that is a point that the President did have an opportunity to reiterate in the context of yesterday's meeting.\nAs it relates to your question about hate crimes, I made a reference to this yesterday in the briefing, that based on what law enforcement officials in Dallas have told us about their interaction with the shooter and what they have learned thus far in the investigation, his actions were targeted at white police officers. His actions were motivated by racial hatred. The hate crime laws that we have on the books don't exist just to protect black people or minorities. They're there to protect all Americans. And given what we know about the racial motivation of the shooter, in the President's mind this fits the definition of a hate crime. Now, the shooter is dead, so obviously charges are not going to be pursued. But that's the way that is often described in a hypothetical. But this was an act of hate.\nQ: Josh, can you give us a preview of tomorrow's meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: You may have seen the President had an opportunity to talk about this a little over the weekend, and the President did update his Facebook page with a post last night with a description of what the President hopes tomorrow's discussion will be about. At the White House, the President will meet with individuals with a wide variety of perspectives on these issues. The President is interested in talking to civil rights activists, academics, leaders in law enforcement, community leaders, law enforcement officials, political leaders to talk about some of these questions that our country has been wrestling with. Those questions have bubbled to the surface in the last week or so.\nBut these are questions that our country has been grappling with for generations. Christi knows this sort for firsthand, based on her own history as a journalist, but these are issues that President Obama has been dealing with since his first years in public service back as a state senator. Senator Obama made a legislative priority of working with Democrats and Republicans, law enforcement leaders, and civil rights leaders to try to address significant problems related to racial profiling in the state of Illinois. And there was important progress that he was able to make legislatively to address some legitimate concerns that had been raised by people on both sides of the issue.\nSo the point is, these are issues that the President both has a track record of working on as a public servant. He also has an intellectual interest in these issues I think because even a dispassionate analysis of the situation would recognize that there are legitimate interests and legitimate concerns that are raised by people of good faith on both sides of this issue -- I guess I should say all side of the issue -- because I think even to reduce these questions down to two sides is to oversimplify them.\nSo I think the President is interested, however, not just in an important conversation at the White House tomorrow, but he's also interested in continuing to push that conversation in the direction of concrete actions and solutions. And that's hard. And even the most optimistic assessment of what could happen tomorrow doesn't leave anybody concluding that all the problems are going to be solved. But the President is hopeful that while the country is focused on this issue, that we can reprioritize and reenergize the search for common ground.\nQ: Josh, when the President talks about the concerns of the Black Lives Matter movement, he draws criticism from people who think he's undercutting the law enforcement agencies and maybe even that he's helping to create an environment where there's hostility toward the police. And by the same token, when he goes to Dallas to speak at a memorial for slain police officers, he draws criticism that he's not going to Baton Rouge or to Falcon Heights. Can you talk about how you hear him thinking through that -- what is actually a dichotomy for him, or at least in terms of public response to it? Does he see it as something where he's trying to hit right in the middle, or is there some other way he's trying to approach that inevitable conflict?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Christi, you're raising an important question. And this is a question that the President will confront quite directly in his remarks today in Dallas. So in a couple hours, he'll say it much more eloquently than I possibly could from here, but let me make one observation that I think does attempt to answer your question.\nWhen the President was talking about this in Warsaw over the weekend, the President expressed a hope that people who are speaking publicly about this issue would do their best to resist the temptation to merely retreat into their partisan or ideological corners. And we've seen this practice far too often, where people who care passionately about this issue -- again, on all sides -- too often see people from a different perspective, not as fellow citizens, but rather as antagonists or opponents or, in some cases, even enemies.\nThat is a significant obstacle, if not the most significant obstacle, that prevents us from making more progress to resolve these questions. That's why it's the President's view that the work that needs to be done is not work that just needs to be done in communities across the country, it's work that needs to be done in the hearts of people across the country.\nThe President will say it much more eloquently than I did.\nQ: Just a quick follow-up. You're a senior advisor to the President. You've been around this for a long time. Do you think he needs to go to Minnesota or Louisiana, or some other community that's grieving this in a different way, to continue this conversation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, since you asked about my own view, why don't I just give you my own view? My view is that, as President of the United States, what the President has to say -- and when we're talking about these issues, what this President has to say about them -- gets lots of attention. And the President's comments and thoughts and work on this issue will get significant scrutiny regardless of where he decides to go to say them.\nFor example, while we were over the Atlantic Ocean on the way to the NATO Summit last Thursday, the President updated his Facebook page with some comments about what had happened earlier that week in Minnesota and Louisiana. This was before the terrible shooting in Dallas, of course. Even in that setting, the President's observations about those situations got a lot of attention.\nSo I think what many people of good faith who are fair-minded, who are urging the President to travel to those places to shine a light on those situations, my observation would be the President has shined a light on those situations. The President has raised the fact of these persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system, even without traveling directly to those two communities.\nQ: Josh, briefly on a different topic. There was a ruling today about the South China Sea. China sort of immediately disregarded it, or dismissed it. Is the United States concerned that China will not follow international law as a result of this ruling on the South China Sea?\nMR. EARNEST: So, Jeff, the ruling from the tribunal numbers some 500 pages, so I cannot give you a definitive reaction to the ruling. Attorneys for the U.S. government are still reviewing the details.\nLet me just say as a general matter, however, that based on the well-established process that's codified in the Law of the Sea Convention, this tribunal ruling is final and binding on both parties. Now, let me make clear, as I've said on numerous occasions: The United States is not a claimant to any land features in the South China Sea. Our interest lies in a desire for a peaceful resolution to disputes and competing claims in that region.\nAgain, the United States wants to preserve the freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in that region of the world. The South China Sea is a strategically important region of the world. It also is a route for billions of dollars in commerce. And it's important to the U.S. economy that that not -- that that flow of commerce not be significantly disrupted. That's why we have gone to great lengths to make clear that we're not a claimant, we're not taking sides in the claims, but we do strongly urge all parties with relevant claims -- many of which are competing -- to resolve their differences peacefully and through established processes like arbitration.\nQ: But to put a finer point on it, does this mean China should stop its reclamation efforts in the South China Sea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we certainly would encourage all parties to acknowledge the final and binding nature of this tribunal. We certainly would urge all parties not to use this as an opportunity to engage in escalatory or provocative actions.\nSo again, we don't have a claim here. The President earlier this year did work with the countries of ASEAN to express their support for the peaceful resolution of these issues and to prevent escalation or provocation or a further militarization of this situation, or this region of the world. But ultimately it's going to be up to the parties to resolve their differences. And there certainly is the potential that the ruling of a tribunal like this could aid in the resolution of these disputes in a way that doesn't further enflame the situation.\nQ: Can I ask another foreign policy one on Poland? The government there has responded to some of the stuff that the President said about their constitutional court by saying that they didn't see the President's comments as in any way critical of their handling of that situation. Obviously the President used some guarded and diplomatic language to describe that, but would it be fair to say that he was critical of what's been going on in Poland with their constitutional court?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, President Obama did have an opportunity to speak both in private with President Duda and publicly to all of you about the situation in Poland. In both settings, the President was conscientious about respecting the sovereignty of the Polish government and the Polish people, and in both settings the President did take advantage of the opportunity to restate the shared values of all of our NATO allies, including Poland. And those values include an unshakeable commitment to the rule of law, to democracy, to a set of universal human rights that includes freedom of speech, freedom of the press.\nThe President talked about the obvious pride that the people of Poland have in advancing those shared values and enshrining them in their constitution. And the President did feel that it was appropriate in the context of the ongoing debate inside of Poland to talk about the shared commitment of NATO allies to those democratic principles.\nBeyond that, I think the President's words that he shared in the news conference on this issue speak for themselves. And you're right to observe that the President's comments were purposeful, both in terms of the words that he chose and the fact that he made the decision to raise these issues publicly.\nQ: One more on Dallas. Is today the first time that he's making -- the President is making an appearance like this, where the victims were exclusively police officers?\nMR. EARNEST: There are other situations where the President has appeared and spoken at a memorial service where first responders were among the victims. I'm thinking of the situation in West, Texas, where there were first responders who responded to that situation. Obviously it's a much different situation.\nI know there are other situations where the President has thanked first responders who were certainly in harm's way. But off the top of my head, I can't think of another situation in which one of the victims of a mass shooting was a law enforcement official. But if I'm wrong about that, that's only my inability to think clearly at this precise moment.\nLook, let me just say -- and I made a reference to this yesterday -- I think in the President's mind, one of the things that deepens this tragedy and deepens the pain that is felt not just by the families of those who were lost but by the entire Dallas community is the fact that among the victims are individuals who volunteered for this duty. These are men who signed up to serve and protect their citizens. These were individuals who were prepared on Thursday night, as they had been every day that they reported for duty, to put their lives on the line to protect their fellow citizens. And on Thursday night, they were protecting their fellow citizens who were exercising their First Amendment right to free speech. And surely the free speech that was being uttered by some of the people in that crowd were statements that these police officers didn't agree with. But that in no way lessened their commitment to their job and their duty to protect the rights of their fellow citizens.\nAnd that situation does deepen this tragedy. There's no denying that.\nQ: Josh, in his remarks on Thursday in Warsaw, the President suggested that these issues are broader than just the police. He talked about the police manning the barricades in communities that have been neglected, and the Dallas police chief kind of echoed that yesterday when he talked all the things the police are being asked to do. Is that something we can expect to hear the President talk about either today or maybe at the White House tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: In terms of today, yes, you can expect to hear the President talk about that a little bit more. Scott, just as you're thinking about this issue, I'd remind you that the time that I heard the President speak in the most detail about this was in the aftermath of the conflicts that we saw in Baltimore. The President did a news conference in the Rose Garden -- you're nodding your head, so you remember what I'm talking about -- the President gave a rather long answer in illustrating this dynamic.\nQ: (Inaudible) with Prime Minister Abe --\nMR. EARNEST: Prime Minister Abe stood rather patiently in the Rose Garden as the President described this particular phenomenon in the United States, that there are communities in the country that don't get as much attention from policymakers that the President believes that they should to address some of the basic problems in these communities -- whether it's to confront a lack of access to health care, or a lack of access to economic opportunity, a lack of access to quality schools, a lack of access to healthy food. And the only thing that they do have access to is robust law enforcement.\nAnd that's not -- first of all, that is entirely unfair to our men and women in law enforcement to thrust all these problems that are too difficult for us to solve. But it also is -- well, it should serve as a wakeup call to state, local and federal governments about the responsibility that they have to citizens in those communities that are plagued by persistent and deeply entrenched problems. We can't just expect police officers to solve it. And this is something that the President is quite passionate about.\nI do understand that this came up in yesterday's meeting with law enforcement leaders as well. I would expect the President to touch on it in his remarks today, and I would expect it to be a subject of some discussion in the conversation that the President has tomorrow.\nQ: Josh, can you just talk to the event that's going on tomorrow at the White House, which you touched on a little bit? Do you anticipate anything further this week happening with the White House? Any other engagement that the President has planned?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, but nothing I can discuss at this point. So stay tuned. We'll see if we can get you some more information before the end of the day today.\nQ: So how do you anticipate that information being shared? You'll put something out? The President will mention it? Obviously it wouldn't be appropriate for him to mention it in his remarks.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not something that the President will mention in his remarks, but we'll make sure that we keep you in the loop on it.\nQ: Josh, do you have any -- we never did a week ahead last week for obvious reasons. Do you have anything else for the President's schedule for the rest of the week that you --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates to the President's schedule at this point, but we'll see if we can get you some more information before the end of the day today.\nEND 12:00 P.M.

Black, R-TN)\nThe Administration strongly opposes the House Amendment to S. 304, the Conscience Protection Act of 2016, because it would have the consequence of limiting women's health care choices and because the Administration believes that protections in current Federal law already provide appropriate protection for the rights of conscience. Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered. Additionally, the Administration has instituted health care policies that appropriately accommodate religious objections. This bill would unduly limit women's health care choices by allowing a broadly-defined set of health providers (including secular sponsors of employer-based health coverage) to decline to provide abortion coverage based on any objections. The legislation would also permanently authorize alternative methods of enforcing these provisions that would inevitably lead to confusion.\nThe Administration is continuing its efforts to protect the rights of conscience, reduce unintended pregnancies, expand access to contraception, support maternal and child health, and minimize the need for abortion. At the same time, the Administration is committed to the protection of women's health and reproductive freedom and to supporting women and families in the choices that they make, which—as the Supreme Court just reaffirmed—are protected by the Constitution.\nIf the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-07-12", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 304 – Conscience Protection Act of 2016"}

To Mr. President and Mrs. Bush; my friend, the Vice President, and Dr. Biden; Mayor Rawlings; Chief Spiller; clergy; Members of Congress; Chief Brown—I'm so glad I met Michelle first, because she loves Stevie Wonder—[laughter]—but most of all, to the families and friends and colleagues and fellow officers: Scripture tells us that in our sufferings there is glory, \"because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.\" Now, sometimes, the truths of these words are hard to see. Right now those words test us. Because the people of Dallas—people across the country—are suffering.\nWe're here to honor the memory, and mourn the loss, of five fellow Americans; to grieve with their loved ones, to support this community, to pray for the wounded, and to try and find some meaning amidst our sorrow.\nFor the men and women who protect and serve the people of Dallas, last Thursday began like any other day. Like most Americans each day, you get up, probably have too quick a breakfast, kiss your family goodbye, and you head to work. But your work—and the work of police officers across the country—is like no other. For the moment you put on that uniform, you have answered a call that at any moment, even in the briefest interaction, may put your life in harm's way.\nLorne Ahrens, he answered that call. So did his wife Katrina, not only because she was the spouse of a police officer, but because she's a detective on the force. They have two kids. And Lorne took them fishing and used to proudly go to their school in uniform. And the night before he died, he bought dinner for a homeless man. And the next night, Katrina had to tell their children that their dad was gone. And \"they don't get it yet,\" their grandma said. \"They don't know what to do quite yet.\"\nMichael Krol answered that call. His mother said, \"He knew the dangers of the job, but he never shied away from his duty.\" He came a thousand miles from his home State of Michigan to be a cop in Dallas, telling his family, \"This is something I wanted to do.\" And last year, he brought his girlfriend back to Detroit for Thanksgiving, and it was the last time he'd see his family.\nMichael Smith answered that call: in the Army and over almost 30 years working for the Dallas Police Association, which gave him the appropriately named \"Cops' Cop\" award. A man of deep faith, when he was off duty, he could be found at church or playing softball with his two girls. Today, his girls have lost their dad, for God has called Michael home.\nPatrick Zamarripa, he answered that call. Just 32, a former altar boy who served in the Navy and dreamed of being a cop. He liked to post videos of himself and his kids on social media. And on Thursday night, while Patrick went to work, his partner Kristy posted a photo of her and their daughter at a Texas Rangers game, and tagged her partner so that he could see it while on duty.\nBrent Thompson answered that call. He served his country as a marine. And years later, as a contractor, he spent time in some of the most dangerous parts of Iraq and Afghanistan. And then a few years ago, he settled down here in Dallas for a new life of service as a transit cop. And just about 2 weeks ago, he married a fellow officer, their whole life together waiting before them.\nLike police officers across the country, these men and their families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves. They weren't looking for their names to be up in lights. They'd tell you the pay was decent, but wouldn't make you rich. They could have told you about the stress and long shifts, and they'd probably agree with Chief Brown when he said that cops don't expect to hear the words \"thank you\" very often, especially from those who need them the most.\nNo, the reward comes in knowing that our entire way of life in America depends on the rule of law; that the maintenance of that law is a hard and daily labor; that in this country, we don't have soldiers in the streets or militias setting the rules. Instead, we have public servants—police officers—like the men who were taken away from us.\nAnd that's what these five were doing last Thursday when they were assigned to protect and keep orderly a peaceful protest in response to the killing of Alton Sterling of Baton Rouge and Philando Castile of Minnesota. They were upholding the constitutional rights of this country.\nFor a while, the protest went on without incident. And despite the fact that police conduct was the subject of the protest, despite the fact that there must have been signs or slogans or chants with which they profoundly disagreed, these men and this department did their jobs like the professionals that they were. In fact, the police had been part of the protest planning. Dallas PD even posted photos on their Twitter feeds of their own officers standing among the protesters. Two officers, Black and White, smiled next to a man with a sign that read, \"No Justice, No Peace.\" [Laughter]\nAnd then, around 9 o'clock, the gunfire came. Another community torn apart. More hearts broken. More questions about what caused, and what might prevent, another such tragedy.\nI know that Americans are struggling right now with what we've witnessed over the past week. First, the shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge and the protests, then the targeting of police by the shooter here, an act not just of demented violence, but of racial hatred. All of it's left us wounded and angry and hurt. It's as if the deepest faultlines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, perhaps even widened. And although we know that such divisions are not new—though they've surely been worse in even the recent past—that offers us little comfort.\nFaced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African American community that feels unfairly targeted by police, and police departments that feel unfairly maligned for doing their jobs, can ever understand each other's experience. We turn on the TV or surf the Internet, and we can watch positions harden and lines drawn, and people retreat to their respective corners, and politicians calculate how to grab attention or avoid the fallout. We see all this, and it's hard not to think sometimes that the center won't hold and that things might get worse.\nI understand. I understand how Americans are feeling. But, Dallas, I'm here to say we must reject such despair. I'm here to insist that we are not as divided as we seem. And I know that because I know America. I know how far we've come against impossible odds. I know we'll make it because of what I've experienced in my own life, what I've seen of this country and its people—their goodness and decency—as President of the United States. And I know it because of what we've seen here in Dallas, how all of you, out of great suffering, have shown us the meaning of perseverance and character and hope.\nWhen the bullets started flying, the men and women of the Dallas police, they did not flinch, and they did not react recklessly. They showed incredible restraint. Helped in some cases by protesters, they evacuated the injured, isolated the shooter, saved more lives than we will ever know. We mourn fewer people today because of your brave actions. \"Everyone was helping each other,\" one witness said. \"It wasn't about Black or White. Everyone was picking each other up and moving them away.\" See, that's the America I know.\nThe police helped Shetamia Taylor as she was shot trying to shield her four sons. She said she wanted her boys to join her to protest the incidents of Black men being killed. She also said to the Dallas PD, \"Thank you for being heroes.\" And today, her 12-year-old son wants to be a cop when he grows up. That's the America I know.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, we've seen Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, a White man and a Black man with different backgrounds, working not just to restore order and support a shaken city, a shaken department, but working together to unify a city with strength and grace and wisdom. And in the process, we've been reminded that the Dallas Police Department has been at the forefront of improving relations between police and the community. The murder rate here has fallen. Complaints of excessive force have been cut by 64 percent. The Dallas Police Department has been doing it the right way. And so, Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, on behalf of the American people, thank you for your steady leadership, thank you for your powerful example. We could not be prouder of you.\nThese men, this department, these—this is the America I know. And today, in this audience, I see people who have protested on behalf of criminal justice reform grieving alongside police officers. I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost, but also weep for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. In this audience, I see what's possible when we recognize that we are one American family, all deserving of equal treatment, all deserving of equal respect, all children of God. That's the America I know.\nNow, I'm not naive. I have spoken at too many memorials during the course of this Presidency. I've hugged too many families who have lost a loved one to senseless violence. And I've seen how a spirit of unity, born of tragedy, can gradually dissipate, overtaken by the return to business as usual, by inertia and old habits and expediency. I see how easily we slip back into our old notions, because they're comfortable, we're used to them. I've seen how inadequate words can be in bringing about lasting change. I've seen how inadequate my own words have been. And so I'm reminded of a passage in John's Gospel [First John; White House correction.]: \"Let us love not with words or speech, but with actions and in truth.\" If we're to sustain the unity we need to get through these difficult times, if we are to honor these five outstanding officers who we've lost, then we will need to act on the truths that we know. And that's not easy. It makes us uncomfortable. But we're going to have to be honest with each other and ourselves.\nWe know that the overwhelming majority of police officers do an incredibly hard and dangerous job fairly and professionally. They are deserving of our respect and not our scorn. And when anyone, no matter how good their intentions may be, paints all police as biased or bigoted, we undermine those officers we depend on for our safety. And as for those who use rhetoric suggesting harm to police, even if they don't act on it themselves, well, they not only make the jobs of police officers even more dangerous, but they do a disservice to the very cause of justice that they claim to promote.\nWe also know that centuries of racial discrimination—of slavery and subjugation and Jim Crow—they didn't simply vanish with the end of lawful segregation. They didn't just stop when Dr. King made a speech or the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act were signed. Race relations have improved dramatically in my lifetime. Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggles that helped us achieve that progress.\nBut we know—but, America, we know that bias remains. We know it. Whether you are Black or White or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or of Middle Eastern descent, we have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point. We've heard it at times in our own homes. If we're honest, perhaps we've heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts. We know that. And while some suffer far more under racism's burden, some feel to a far greater extent discrimination's sting; although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children better, none of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this.\nAnd so when African Americans from all walks of life, from different communities across the country, voice a growing despair over what they perceive to be unequal treatment; when study after study shows that Whites and people of color experience the criminal justice system differently so that if you're Black you're more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested, more likely to get longer sentences, more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime; when mothers and fathers raise their kids right and have \"the talk\" about how to respond if stopped by a police officer—\"yes, sir,\" \"no, sir\"—but still fear that something terrible may happen when their child walks out the door, still fear that kids being stupid and not quite doing things right might end in tragedy—when all this takes place more than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid. We can't simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your White friends and coworkers and fellow church members again and again and again, it hurts. Surely, we can see that, all of us.\nWe also know what Chief Brown has said is true: That so much of the tensions between police departments and minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves. As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, \"You're a social worker, you're the parent, you're the teacher, you're the drug counselor.\" We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience. Don't make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind. And then, we feign surprise when, periodically, the tensions boil over.\nWe know these things to be true. They've been true for a long time. We know it. Police, you know it. Protestors, you know it. You know how dangerous some of the communities where these police officers serve are, and you pretend as if there's no context. These things we know to be true. And if we cannot even talk about these things, if we cannot talk honestly and openly not just in the comfort of our own circles, but with those who look different than us or bring a different perspective, then we will never break this dangerous cycle. In the end, it's not about finding policies that work, it's about forging consensus and fighting cynicism and finding the will to make change. Can we do this? Can we find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other? Can we see in each other a common humanity and a shared dignity and recognize how our different experiences have shaped us? And it doesn't make anybody perfectly good or perfectly bad, it just makes us human. I don't know. I confess that sometimes I, too, experience doubt. I've been to too many of these things. I've seen too many families go through this. But then I am reminded of what the Lord tells Ezekiel. \"I will give you a new heart,\" the Lord says, \"and put a new spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\"\nThat's what we must pray for, each of us: a new heart. Not a heart of stone, but a heart open to the fears and hopes and challenges of our fellow citizens. That's what we've seen in Dallas these past few days. That's what we must sustain.\nBecause with an open heart, we can learn to stand in each other's shoes and look at the world through each other's eyes so that maybe the police officer sees his own son in that teenager with a hoodie who's kind of goofing off, but not dangerous; and the teenager, maybe the teenager will see in the police officer the same words and values and authority of his parents.\nWith an open heart, we can abandon the overheated rhetoric and the oversimplification that reduces whole categories of our fellow Americans, not just to opponents, but to enemies.\nWith an open heart, those protesting for change will guard against reckless language going forward, look at the model set by the five officers we mourn today, acknowledge the progress brought about by the sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas, and embark on the hard but necessary work of negotiation, the pursuit of reconciliation.\nWith an open heart, police departments will acknowledge that, just like the rest of us, they are not perfect; that insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not an attack on cops, but an effort to live up to our highest ideals. And I understand, these protests—I see them—they can be messy. Sometimes, they can be hijacked by an irresponsible few. Police can get hurt. Protestors can get hurt. They can be frustrating.\nBut even those who dislike the phrase \"Black Lives Matter,\" surely we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling's family. We should—when we hear a friend describe him by saying that \"whatever he cooked, he cooked enough for everybody,\" that should sound familiar to us, that maybe he wasn't so different than us, so that we can, yes, insist that his life matters. Just as we should hear the students and coworkers describe their affection for Philando Castile as a gentle soul—\"Mr. Rogers with dreadlocks,\" they called him—and know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all races, of all ages, and that we have to do what we can, without putting officers' lives at risk, but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost.\nWith an open heart, we can worry less about which side has been wronged and worry more about joining sides to do right. Because the vicious killer of these police officers, they won't be the last person who tries to make us turn on one other. And the killer in Orlando wasn't, nor was the killer in Charleston. We know there is evil in this world. That's why we need police departments. But as Americans, we can decide that people like this killer will ultimately fail. They will not drive us apart. We can decide to come together and make our country reflect the good inside us, the hopes and simple dreams we share. \"We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.\" For all of us, life presents challenges and suffering: accidents, illnesses, the loss of loved ones. There are times when we are overwhelmed by sudden calamity, natural or manmade. All of us, we make mistakes. And at times, we are lost. And as we get older, we learn we don't always have control of things, not even a President does. But we do have control over how we respond to the world. We do have control over how we treat one another.\nAmerica does not ask us to be perfect. Precisely because of our individual imperfections, our Founders gave us institutions to guard against tyranny and ensure no one is above the law; a democracy that gives us the space to work through our differences and debate them peacefully, to make things better, even if it doesn't always happen as fast as we'd like. America gives us the capacity to change.\nBut as the men we mourn today—these five heroes—knew better than most, we cannot take the blessings of this Nation for granted. Only by working together can we preserve those institutions of family and community, rights and responsibilities, law and self-government that is the hallmark of this Nation. For, it turns out, we do not persevere alone. Our character is not found in isolation. Hope does not arise by putting our fellow man down, it is found by lifting others up.\nAnd that's what I take away from the lives of these outstanding men. The pain we feel may not soon pass, but my faith tells me that they did not die in vain. I believe our sorrow can make us a better country. I believe our righteous anger can be transformed into more justice and more peace. Weeping may endure for a night, but I'm convinced joy comes in the morning. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Officers Zamarripa and Ahrens, Krol, Smith, and Thompson, but surely we can try to match their sense of service. We cannot match their courage, but we can strive to match their devotion.\nMay God bless their memory. May God bless this country that we love.", "timestamp": "2016-07-12", "title": "Remarks at a Memorial Service for Victims of the Shootings in Dallas, Texas"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117841", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:46 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Wednesday. I do not have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to questions.\nJosh, do you want to go first?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to start with Theresa May, who, literally, as we speak, is being confirmed as Britain's new Prime Minister. I know you said that the President feels he can work with whoever Britain selects as their new leader. But now that we're all getting to know a little more about her, I was wondering if there's anything specific where he sees an opportunity and sees eye-to-eye with her, and planning to really try and work with her.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, as it relates to this question about Brexit, that obviously is in many ways the most significant domestic policy issue that the new Prime Minister will have to confront. And the President has been quite clear about what he hopes and expects that process will entail, which is an orderly process and a good-faith negotiation between the UK and the EU, which, even after that negotiation has been completed, we'll still have an important economic relationship.\nThere are obviously broader consequences for the global economy in terms of the way that negotiation is handled. And based on the public comments we've seen from the incoming Prime Minister, she intends to pursue a course that's consistent with the prescription that President Obama has offered.\nGiven the nature of her previous position as the Home Secretary, she engaged with U.S. officials on a variety of national security issues. So there are U.S. officials -- like Secretary Johnson, even Lisa Monaco here at the White House -- who have worked with her on issues that are important to the national security of both of our countries. But that's the kind of working relationship you'd expect somebody to have with the United States, given the special relationship between our two countries. But those U.S. officials that have worked with her found her to be quite effective. And basically we congratulate her on her new position and on the important responsibility that she will assume.\nQ: And I wanted to ask you about this firestorm that's erupted over some comments that Justice Ginsburg made to the Associated Press and to some other news organizations about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Does the White House have any concerns about that kind of language from a Supreme Court justice, or feel that it's appropriate for her to be making those kinds of -- opining in that way about the presidential election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, she didn't earn the nickname, \"the notorious RBG\" for nothing. But what I will say is that in the past I've been asked about controversial comments from other Supreme Court justices. I don't know whether it was earlier this year or at the end of last year when Justice Scalia made some comments in an open Supreme Court hearing that many found to be quite controversial, possibly even racist. At that point, I declined to wade into that criticism. And I think I'll pursue a similar approach in this instance.\nQ: And lastly, I wanted to ask about this meeting that the President is having today with law enforcement officials and civil rights activists and others. Given the amount of time that's left in the administration, what does the President hope or believe he may be able to achieve in terms of bridging this divide that he spoke about yesterday and that we've all been discussing before he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I think it's the President's desire to try to move the ball forward and make some progress in helping communities identify steps that they can take to address this problem. That will certainly be an important part of the conversation that he has later today.\nWe'll have more details about that meeting after it's taken place, and you'll have an opportunity to hear from the President at the conclusion of that meeting. But this meeting will include political leaders, law enforcement officials, representatives of rank-and-file police officers, academics, civil rights activists, other thought leaders from all across the country. And every community is unique and every community needs to confront these challenges in a way that reflects the reality of the situation in their own community.\nIt's the President's view, though, that communities across the country can learn from the effective strategies that have been tried in other places. And that was certainly the goal of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing that was organized by the White House. This is a task force that included representatives from a similarly broad set of perspectives that canvassed the country and worked with local community leaders to surface ideas. And the goal was to put forward a set of best practices that communities all across the country could draw upon as they try to confront this challenge in their own communities.\nAnd so there certainly will be a discussion about what steps we can take to try to encourage other communities to capitalize on these best practices. And part of this conversation, Josh, is about making sure that these issues remain a priority and that we reenergize the effort around these issues. Too often there's the sense that a tragedy happens and there's intense focus on this issue for a couple of weeks, and then it subsides. And what's unique about this situation -- what's unique about this challenge is it's not something that can be solved in a couple of weeks. It's going to require the determined and sustained effort of leaders from all sides in order to effectively implement some of these solutions.\nAnd so the President is hopeful that this convening can be useful in focusing attention on these issues over the long term and making sure that the institutional energy and attention that must be devoted on them to succeed is something that people follow through on.\nQ: How do you square that strategy of saying we really want more communities to implement these recommendations that were created by this task force that you mentioned, but the fact that this latest tragedy took place in a community that the White House actually touted for having done a good job of implementing them? I mean, doesn't that suggest that they're either ineffective or insufficient to prevent these kinds of things from happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess when you say -- it depends on what you mean by \"to prevent these kinds of things from happening.\" I don't think that, unfortunately, there's any set of best practices that will ensure that -- well, let me say it this way. Police officers have a dangerous job. And there's no single law that we can pass that will effectively protect every police officer all across the country. I think that's why the President talked at great length yesterday about how important it is for us to respect the vast majority of the men and women in uniform who do an outstanding job. Their work is worthy of our respect and not our scorn, as the President described it. So that's the first thing.\nI think the second thing is the reforms that have been put in place in Dallas have made a difference. We have seen a significant reduction in complaints that have been filed against police officers in the Dallas Police Department for the use of excessive force, for example. Incidents of police shootings where police officers have to use their firearms are down significantly. Those are tragedies that are being prevented. That is a reflection of why it's important for other communities to make this issue a priority in the same way that Dallas has. It's making a difference in the lives of the people in Dallas, because it's not just those incidents of concern about police conduct that have declined; the violent crime rates declined, too.\nSo it's not too often these issues are viewed as, well, we have to choose between protecting civil liberties and protecting the rights of minorities and effective crime-fighting. That's not true. That's a false choice. The truth is, those communities -- like Dallas -- that are particularly effective at building trust, even in minority communities, does coincide with a reduction in crime. It does make it possible for police officers to do their job more safely and even more effectively. And that's the case that the President will certainly make in the context of today's discussion, and it certainly is the case that he's hopeful that policymakers and political leaders and law enforcement officials and activists all across the country will hear.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. Following up on the response to the Dallas shooting and the other high-profile police shootings, yesterday the President said that he had seen how his words were inadequate to respond to all of these shootings that the country has dealt with. But at this point, is there really anything that the White House can do that -- beyond words, beyond having meetings, beyond the town hall, beyond just urging jurisdictions to take on these practices? I mean, is there anything that the White House can do that's really beyond words at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, as the President acknowledged in his speech yesterday -- and he said it more eloquently than I will from here -- but he talked about how powerful words can be in rejecting despair and ensuring that we, for all our differences, that we try to open our hearts to demonstrating some empathy to people that don't look like us or may not share our perspective. That it's through that path we can find concrete solutions.\nSo the President did acknowledge that his words have been inadequate in completely solving this problem. But the other observation I have about yesterday's remarks -- there are some things that the President said in his speech were, admittedly, provocative. They were challenging to all of us; he included himself in that category. But the response that we have seen from his speech has been quite positive. And, again, that's based on news coverage, that's based on anecdotal responses and comments that we've seen from people across the country. And the President is pleased about that.\nAnd that, I think, is an indication that our country is making at least some progress; that at this time where there is so much tension and anxiety and frustration and sadness and anger and tragedy, that having the President of the United States both appropriately pay his respects to the courage and patriotism and sacrifice of five police officers in Dallas, but also challenge the country and have the response be positive, is a good thing. And again, I think it says something important about the President, but also says something really important about the country.\nSo it was a little bit different than the question that you asked, but I felt it was important to acknowledge that, yes, the President was blunt about the inadequacy of his words. But it doesn't mean that words aren't important. And I think yesterday was a good illustration of that.\nBeyond that, the question that you're asking is essentially the subject of the discussion today. That's why the President has essentially cleared his calendar for the afternoon so he can spend a lot of time with these leaders in communities across the country that represent a wide variety of perspectives to dig into this question about what else can be done. Certainly the work that was done by the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing was important. Certainly the work that the White House has done on the Police Data Initiative -- that was something that Josh referenced that Dallas has been a leading advocate of and participant in -- is something that is important and will make a difference over the long term. Greater transparency is something that can have a tangible impact on repairing and building trust between law enforcement officials and community leaders.\nBut there certainly is a conversation about what else can be done. In Dallas, one of the other things that people have pointed to in terms of the kind of success that they've seen in their city has been rooted in their training regimen. And this was a leading initiative of Chief Brown in terms of not just increasing training requirements in terms of the number of hours that officer have to undergo periodically, but they also changed the training regimen to make it more realistic -- more \"reality-based\" I think are the words that they've used to describe it. But they have also made de-escalation a focus of their training efforts. And the fact is, that de-escalation training over time does appear to be correlated with fewer conflicts between police officers and citizens.\nSo I think the other thing that is true is that there certainly is a role that the federal government can play in terms of offering expertise about this training. In some cases, there's a role that the federal government can play in providing resources to the departments that are committed to this kind of training.\nSo I'm certainly not going to rule out that there may be an opportunity for the federal government to do more. And that will certainly be part of the conversation today. But what will also be part of the conversation today is what can local political leaders do more of, what can law enforcement officials do more, what can civil rights leaders do more, what can community leaders do more to repair this trust that in too many communities has been frayed.\nRon.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, you said there's a wide variety of participants. Who are some of the participants?\nMR. EARNEST: So we'll get you a list later this afternoon as the meeting gets started.\nQ: But in terms of what kinds of backgrounds they represent, you said it was a variety. Are we talking about --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in some cases we're talking about elected officials, we're talking about law enforcement officials, police chiefs, and other -- they're also representatives of rank-and-file police officers. There are academics. There are civil rights leaders.\nQ: Are some of these people -- are some of these groups that the President has been at odds with, for lack of a better characterization -- are there critics who were specifically invited?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that there are people who are participating in this meeting who have uttered public comments that have not been 100 percent supportive of what the President has had to say.\nQ: What areas and what --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, you'll have an opportunity to evaluate once you see the list of people who are attending.\nQ: I'm trying to get to the substance of this meeting. So much of this discussion is about notions of best practices. Just one metric -- does advancing the 21st policing initiative -- that was the year afterwards -- I saw some that suggested that there were only a handful -- 15 departments that have signed up for this initiative. Is there some other metric that indicates how successful this initiative has been in terms of getting departments to actually engage, commit, sign on to it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, we'll see if we can provide some additional data on this. But there are obviously a variety of ways that -- it certainly is possible for local law enforcement organizations and local communities to decide that they're going to start to implement some of these best practices, even if they don't sign up for the entire initiative. And that's why the goal of the task force was to actually generate something tangible, and that's what they've done. And we've talked in here on a number of occasions how the leverage that the federal government has in terms of forcing local law enforcement agencies to consider these kinds of best practices is limited. And there are a whole host of good reasons for that. But what we can do is certainly make sure that people understand this is something they should be paying attention to.\nQ: In terms of what the President has not been able to get departments to do that he would like to see them do, is there some -- can you break it down into some more granular form of exactly what -- training, for example, is one big area, and transparency. These are big concepts. Is there some -- are there things, for example, in this meeting that the President is going to push, to say, you should do A, B, C and D specifically, which I think at this remarks the other day, or somewhere along the line in the last few days he talked about how we need more urgency and more -- a sense of urgency about these things. What specific things is the President going to try and push? I know this is a conversation, but clearly he has very strong ideas about --\nMR. EARNEST: He does.\nQ: -- about what he would like departments across the country to do tomorrow.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the first thing that the President will acknowledge is that there's no cookie-cutter solution that can be applied. Every community is different, and every community has their own unique dynamics. Every community has their own traditions. Every community has their own history. So, again, that is why it is incumbent on governors and mayors and community leaders and leaders in law enforcement to focus on these kinds of solutions. And it's going to require a collaborative effort.\nAnd, look, if only it were as easy as saying do this one thing and all these problems would be solved. It's not that simple. And that's part -- that's what adds to the complexity. But let's talk through a couple of the things that would work. We know, for example, that enhanced training works.\nQ: Enhanced training around --\nMR. EARNEST: For police officers.\nQ: Around --\nMR. EARNEST: In terms of training them in de-escalation tactics. That certainly is something that -- again, that's something that worked well in Dallas and there are other communities that have seen a similar benefit. The other thing that this administration and this White House has pioneered is something called the Police Data Initiative, where we've been encouraging law enforcement agencies to release a whole lot more information about interaction between their law enforcement officers and the community. That actually serves a variety of purposes. The first is, it allows that data to be carefully analyzed and could yield helpful information that could point us in a direction of tangible solutions in a particular community.\nThe other thing that it does is it certainly enhances trust between the law enforcement and the community when the community can evaluate for themselves how that law enforcement agency is getting along with the community. And to be able to demonstrate, as they have in Dallas, a reduction in complaints against the excessive use of force, for example, is the kind of thing that starts to change hearts and minds in the community. That certainly is something that is important, and the White House has provided a vehicle for doing that.\nAnd, again, this is data that can be used by analysts to offer up new ideas for solving some of these problems. But even just submitting and publicizing the data in the first place is something that will have a tangible impact on the relationship between law enforcement and the community.\nQ: But in terms of the President's -- the meeting that he participated in the other day with Vice President Biden and the police officials, there was one thing that was reported about how he said that he would go over the list of military surplus equipment that he saw police departments getting. Were there any other specific things that he said that he would do, that law enforcement wants him to do to sort of compromise on policies, initiatives that he has put forth that they are not happy with to try and bridge this gap? Is that one of the things that was specific and tangible that came out of the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I was out here talking to all of you while the President was doing that meeting in the Roosevelt Room on Monday, but police organizations certainly did raise this question about their ability to procure some equipment from the federal government that can be useful in law enforcement operations in communities across the country. And this was a subject of some controversy a couple of summers ago when there were questions raised about the way in which the Ferguson Police Department was using some of the equipment that they had obtained from the federal government. There was a concern -- I think a legitimate one -- that was raised that their use of that equipment was overly militarizing the situation.\nSo there has been an effort on the part of the administration to try to reform that procurement process -- not to deny police and law enforcement organizations the equipment that they need to do their jobs, but rather to govern that process a little bit more effectively and make sure, for example, that if high-powered equipment or if a high-powered weapon, for example, is being provided to a local law enforcement organization, that they also are training their officers to properly and effectively use that equipment. That seems like a common-sense thing -- to make sure that as this equipment is provided, that training is provided too.\nSo what the President committed to do is to go back and take a look at these reforms and make sure that our effort to reform the process and make it work more effectively wasn't preventing law enforcement officers from being able to purchase equipment that they actually need and that they are trained to use.\nQ: Are there any other areas, issues that you would argue that the President took a step and said, okay, I'll rethink something I've said or done -- like altering that program -- as not a concession -- that's perhaps a harsh word -- as a way of trying to work with police departments to try and deal with some of the things that they want? Are there any other specifics where you can say, here, this is what the President is doing to bridge this divide and to see things more your way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think it is fair for you to assume that the President is going to try to practice what he preaches. And he certainly did talk at length yesterday about trying to remain open to every point of view and to apply some intellectual honesty and some sincerity to understanding someone else's point of view.\nNow, I do think that I can quite effectively document the way in which the President has both symbolically and tangibly shown his strong support for our men and women in law enforcement. The President has talked in his State of the Union address, arguably the biggest platform that he has, about how law enforcement officers have a right to come home at the end of their shift, and that even people that do have some concerns with law enforcement have to respect that right. The President was unequivocal about that.\nBut, yes, the President is interested. The reason that the President had the meeting on Monday -- or the reason -- I guess I should say the reason that the President attended the meeting that was organized by the Vice President on Monday, to be more precise, is that he wanted to hear from leaders in law enforcement. He wanted to understand their perspective. That at a time when their officers are under so much scrutiny, he wanted to understand how they saw this situation. And I think the President found that valuable.\nQ: Does the President -- why did he think it was appropriate to mention the recent cases in Minnesota and the Sterling and Castile cases in that forum yesterday? They're under investigation. There is a DOJ investigation of one of them. They're unresolved. Why did he feel that, at a service focusing on the deaths of law enforcement, that he needed to bring up those cases?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's decision to do that was rooted in the idea that none of these tragedies -- the shooting at Baton Rouge, the shooting in Minnesota, or obviously the hateful attack on police officers in Dallas -- took place in a vacuum. And that understanding that context is to understand the way that the country is reacting to all of this.\nAnd the point that the President was making is that, yes, the situations in Baton Rouge and Minnesota are under investigation -- and they should be. And we're all going to have to limit our comments on them while that investigation is ongoing. But the two men who lost their lives in those two incidents are people that have loved ones. They have people who cared about them. They have people in communities that are grieving their loss. And the President felt it was important to acknowledge that, and he feels it's important for everyone to acknowledge that.\nThat, of course, does not -- as the President -- that doesn't condone in any way an act of violence against a police officer. It's not possible to justify an act of violence against a police officer -- even people who have deep concerns about what happened in Baton Rouge and Minnesota. But what all of us need to do is open our hearts to understanding the perspective of people who may look different than us, or who may have a different perspective -- that that will be critical to our ability to solve this problem as a country.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, on this convening -- this convening and any other convening the President may have when it comes to dealing with the conversation -- his leading the conversation on race -- he talked yesterday of the heart issue. When Bill Clinton talked about it when he was President, he said -- he had the conversation on race -- he looked at it from a legislative standpoint as well as the heart issue. And I want to focus in on the heart. What does the President expect when it comes to the heart issue of him leaving these conversations at the end of the day, at the end of his term, on January 20th, 2017 at noon? What does the heart say?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't think these problems are going to be solved in January. This will be a challenge that the next President and the President after that, and then the President after that is going to have to deal with. The President made the point that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow wasn't completely washed away just by the signing of the Civil Rights Act. So these are going to be challenges that future generations will have to confront. But previous generations can tell us in vivid terms how much progress we've made.\nAnd the President had the opportunity to contribute to that earlier in his presidency when he traveled to Selma in the spring of 2015 to commemorate the progress that was made in that community. And the President was blunt yesterday about denying that progress is to fail to appreciate the sacrifices that were made by Americans of all races in pursuit of civil rights, in pursuit of the ideals and values of this country.\nSo the President is hopeful that we can make some progress. And as I noted in my answer to Ayesha, I think the response from the country to the President's speech yesterday is an indication that we are making some progress.\nQ: So when you look at the issue with community and police, that's one component of a larger issue. Will the President begin to break it down? Because when you look at stats, the facts from any department within your administration, there are a high number of negatives in almost every category when it comes to African Americans and our Latino brothers and sisters in this country. Will he also move into other aspects? Is this just one component of a broader focus on race? Or is this the piece that he feels that he needs to deal with right now and that's going throughout the rest of the term?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, the President certainly did talk about a phenomenon that he's discussed in previous settings, as well, that in too many communities across the country, there are not sufficient resources dedicated to things like expanding economic opportunity and giving kids access to a quality education, and making sure that good health care and good mental health care is available, ensuring that there are healthy foods available for purchase.\nThese are the kinds of things that are critical to the success of the community. And too many communities and the people who live in them are deprived of those basics. And the consequences for law enforcement are that those problems get thrust on them. And that's not fair. The jobs that are performed by our men and women in law enforcement are hard enough already. As the President described it yesterday -- to make them not just a law enforcement officer, but to make them a teacher and a parent and a drug counselor is unfair. And the President, frankly, is tired of people feigning surprise when the tensions boil over.\nSo that's why he's going to continue to fight for things like raising the minimum wage and increasing funding for schools, and trying to expand job training, and fighting for equal pay for equal work, continuing to encourage states to expand Medicaid. These are all things that are going to have a tangible impact on the health and wellbeing and success of communities across the country. And if effectively implemented, and if we can make some progress on those things, that won't just improve the lives of the people in those communities; that will at least a little bit lighten the significant burden that is borne by our men and women in law enforcement.\nQ: I want to rewind the clock a bit. Back to early in this President's presidency when his friend, Henry \"Skip\" Gates, had a confrontation in his home -- as he was trying to go into his home -- with Sergeant James Crowley. What did the President learn from that beer summit that he had right outside the Oval Office? And what is he going to bring from that into today's session?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if I have a good answer to that question. Look, I think the President I think wanted to use that moment, as he described it, as a teachable moment. And he was hopeful that it would -- that that situation and the ability of those two men to come together in the Rose Garden of the White House would serve as a useful illustration, again, that our country is not quite as divided as it might seem. But that may be the kind of question -- in terms of the President's own personal lesson from that situation, that may be one you have to direct to him.\nQ: And lastly, since I brought up the beer summit, and that was such a pivotal movement -- that kind of led to a thread with issues of community and policing throughout this presidency, throughout his at least eight years -- I want to go back to the convening and as it relates to t beer summit. So would Skip Gates be one of those in the meeting, as well as Sergeant James Crowley? And also, is Sylvia Burwell in that meeting, since she was head of President Clinton's conversation on race in America?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll get you the full list later today. So I don't think any of those people are on the list.\nQ: Really?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nAndrew.\nQ: Since about 2004, the President has espoused this idea that there is no black America, there's no white America, there's just the United States of America. Given recent racial tensions that we've seen, and given the rise of Donald Trump, is the President reassessing that measure?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all. Andrew, it would be easy to conclude, if you just looked at the tone and tenor of the political debate in Washington, D.C., that our country is quite divided. And the President does not believe that our country is nearly as divided as it might seem. And I think there are any number of examples of that. I think anybody who had the chance to attend the service yesterday observed rather vividly the diversity in the room. It wasn't just that there was a white mayor and a black police chief who were standing on the same stage, grieving the loss of five police officers. The room was filled with police officers in uniform. And it wasn't just the white officers who were grieving the loss of their colleagues. There were men and women -- black, white, brown, Asian -- all in uniform, all grieving that loss.\nAnd they heard expressions of sympathy from the white Republican President, and they heard condolences from the current black Democratic President. Those are all -- particularly when you consider the legacy of race in Dallas, Texas, the President's expression of unity I think was on full display.\nQ: But you would accept the President, given who is he is, is not able to convince the people who need to be convinced in order to bring change about? I mean, there's this constituency that he's just never going to be able to reach.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't think the President is ready to give up on anybody. And I think the President took this pretty directly, Andrew. So, again, I'm not going to be able to summon the eloquence that he demonstrated yesterday, but the President is not going to give into despair. He's not going to give up hope.\nIn fact, he talked movingly about what gives him so much hope. And the story that he told about the woman in Dallas who took her four sons to the protest, an African American woman who had genuine concerns about police conduct in law enforcement agencies across the country, particularly as it relates to treatment of black men -- her powerful retelling of that story of taking her sons to participate in that peaceful march only to come under gunfire, and to have her be hit, and for her to be terrified about the safety of her kids, and to put her life on the line, to lay on top of her son to shield him from the hail of bullets, only to find a police officer come and do the same thing for her, and to have white police officers come to her rescue, to protect her, and then for her to say that that is just the latest reason that her youngest son says he wants to be a cop when he grows up -- that's powerful. That's going to give you a lot of confidence and a lot of hope and a lot of optimism about the future of this country.\nWe've had ample reasons in the last couple of weeks, Andrew, to try to consult those examples of reassurance. But every time the President does, he's filled once again with the kind of hope and optimism that animated his campaign and that has animated his presidency.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, you talked about the list of attendees coming out later, but we've heard from the President a number of times talking about the importance of getting everyone to hear and listen to each other. Can you say at a minimum if anyone from Black Lives Matter is going to be in the room to be listened to and heard?\nMR. EARNEST: There will be individuals who I think would describe themselves as part of the Black Lives Matter movement who will be participating in the meeting today.\nQ: And can you explain why that's important? Because there are a lot of people who have a problem with the movement and --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this is the President's desire to bring people into one room that have a variety of perspectives to represent. I'm confident that there will be law enforcement officials in the room who are deeply troubled by the actions and comments of some people who associate themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement. And the President has cautioned about applying the controversial comments and actions of some -- he didn't call them controversial, he called them stupid -- actions and comments of some and applying them to an entire movement is just as unfair and just as wrong as attributing the illegal actions of a couple of law enforcement officers to every cop in the country. That's wrong, too. That's not fair. It's not accurate. And resisting that impulse and keeping open our hearts will be necessary to making progress on this challenge.\nQ: Can you say whether the President has decided how he's going to continue to talk, communicate, maybe take on this issue after the end of his term? I know you said everything is not going to be fixed by January. I can imagine he wants to continue working on it.\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that the President will continue to work on this and talk about these issues and maybe even write about them in his post-presidency. We've talked a little bit about the President's My Brother's Keeper initiative. This is an initiative that is focused on trying to mentor young men of color. That certainly is something I would anticipate that both the President and the First Lady will devote time to once they've left the White House. Certainly the focus on mentoring young men of color has an important intersection with building trust with law enforcement. So I think that's just one example, but I'm confident in saying there will be others.\nQ: And an element to that when it comes to law enforcement, or not necessarily?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that in some of those conversations -- well, look, the focus of that initiative is on young men of color and making sure that they get the time and attention that they need to overcome some of the obstacles that are erected in their path. So that obviously is going to have consequences for the way they interact with law enforcement. But, look, other than describing the President and First Lady's involvement in that initiative, it's hard for me to say with a lot of specificity what else they have planned.\nQ: Can I ask you quickly -- I know you said you don't want to comment on whether it was appropriate for Ruth Bader Ginsburg to make the comments she did. But that aside, can you say if the President has confidence in her right now? Donald Trump has attacked her mental state and said her mind is shot. Do you have a comment on that? I mean, is there confidence that the Supreme Court justice is with her wits about her fully?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't call -- I would not call her competence into question and I think anybody who has observed her, she's done her work. Whether you agree with her or not, and whether you agree with every ruling that she has issued, I think over the course of her career she has demonstrated a keen intellect and an understanding of the law, and a commitment to ensuring that it's applied fairly to every American citizen.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association announced on Friday that they may request to the White House that it be illuminated in blue in honor of the fallen officers in Dallas. Knowing that the White House has previously been illuminated, both in 2013 in pink for breast cancer awareness and again in 2015 in the wake of the same-sex marriage ruling by the Supreme Court, has there been any consideration or any thought given to lighting the White House in blue in honor of law enforcement?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have much to say about the potential consideration. I can tell you that's not something that we plan to do at this point. The President certainly has, in a variety of ways, acknowledged the tragedy and honored the life of the five Dallas police officers who were killed last week. The President, while he was overseas, ordered flags across the country lowered to half-staff as the nation mourns the loss of those police officers. And, of course, the President traveled to Dallas just yesterday to speak at the memorial service that was organized to honor their service and honor their sacrifice.\nAnd after that service concluded, the President spent more than an hour with the families of those who were lost and spent time visiting with some of those who were injured, including police officers who were injured in that shooting. So there are a variety of ways that the President and this administration have chosen to conspicuously demonstrate our deep gratitude and our solemn condolences in the aftermath of the shooting that claimed the lives of five police officers in Dallas last week.\nQ: So you're not opposed to it, it's just not something that the President has made a move on yet?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I think it's appropriate for people to conclude that the President has chosen to acknowledge this loss and to pay tribute to these heroes in a variety of other ways, including ordering the flags lowered to half-staff, traveling to Dallas to speak at the memorial service, and spending a substantial amount of time after the service visiting with the families of those who were lost.\nQ: On Zika, time is running out, for lack of a better description. Apparently, the Republicans have made an offer. Is the White House in contact with Democrats to try to get something done before the seven-week break?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the Republican offer. I think it's the Democrats that have made an offer that was rejected by Republicans. And the Majority Leader's response has been to essentially take it or leave it -- and by \"it\" he means a politically motivated piece of legislation that seems much more focused on trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act and prevent women from being able to get access to Planned Parenthood services, and deals with confederate flags much more than it is on trying to address a genuine public health emergency.\nAnd I say that because the amount of funding that's included in the bill is woefully short of what our public health professionals say is needed to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. So I think the irony is the Senate Majority Leader has observed something like the Senate is running out of time. He says that as the Senate is prepared to leave a day early for their seven-week vacation in the middle of a public health crisis. So I'm not exactly sure how he squares that, but instead of trying to confront a public health crisis, maybe we'll just tune in and listen to him speak at the Republican Convention because I guess that's where he'll be instead.\nQ: Speaking of the Republican Convention, Donald Trump is --\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin is not one to miss a segue, guys. (Laughter.) Well done, my man.\nQ: Thank you. Donald Trump is going to be on Fox tonight and -- on Special Report with Bret Baier -- and knowing how much --\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good plug for Mr. Baier right there. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- how much you love to talk about this subject, if there were one question that you might have for Donald Trump, who will be on the air tonight, six o'clock Eastern -- (laughter) --\nMR. EARNEST: That's provocative right there. (Laughter.) Well, listen, your colleague Mr. Baier has an excellent reputation for asking very tough questions. The President can certainly speak firsthand about that. And I think that's one of the reasons we'll be tuning in at 6 p.m. Eastern to see how that conversation goes. (Laughter.)\nQ: I appreciate that. Last one -- if you'll indulge me -- South China Sea, a very interesting ruling by the international community, saying once again, listen, you've got to stop with this nonsense in the South China Sea. What's the administration's response not just to, again, the legal pushback against Beijing, but also some of the concerns that others might have that as they watch the administration's perspective and how you all react to what China is apparently trying to do there that could have implications on, say, what Russia does in the Arctic, for example, or other actors might have similar designs on the Middle East?\nMR. EARNEST: You're raising an excellent point, Kevin, so let me get to that. A couple things I'll just make clear. The ruling that was issued by this tribunal was quite extensive. And I know that it was now more than 24 hours ago, but I can tell you that administration lawyers continue to review the ruling.\nSo I can't offer a definitive reaction to it, but there are a couple things I can say. The first is, to remind all of you, and to remind anybody who may be reading this transcript, that the United States is not a claimant to any land features in the South China Sea. And, in fact, we don't support or oppose any specific claims that any of the sides have made. Rather, the United States has strongly urged those with competing claims to resolve them peacefully and to resolve those disputes through diplomacy, including through arbitration.\nNow, the Law of the Sea Convention, to which both China and the Philippines are signatories, has followed the process that's specified in the convention. They've issued this ruling, and that's why it's the United States' view that this tribunal finding is binding and final. More generally, to go to the point that you're raising that I think is a good one, in an increasingly interconnected world, respecting international laws and rules is critically important. There are norms that must be observed to ensure the success of our interconnected world if we want to be able to trade effectively, if we want to be able to travel internationally, if we want to ensure that our integrated global supply chain continues to function in a way that's as efficient as possible. We know that enhances the economic prospects for everybody. We know that our ability to travel anywhere around the world is something that we value.\nSo this interconnectedness is something that has to be protected. And if there's a willingness on the part of bigger countries to violate those norms and to throw their weight around, that can be disruptive. And the irony is, is that the biggest countries with the biggest economies are the ones that have the greatest incentive to protecting the stability of the world order. And that certainly is why you've seen the United States make such a strong statement about the need to resolve these disputes through diplomacy and through arbitration. We want to protect the billions of dollars of commerce that flows through the South China Sea. We want to protect the transit lanes and the shipping lanes in that region of the world. And we want to make sure that those competing claims don't devolve into some sort of military confrontation.\nSo that's why we've taken the position that we have. We're not claimants, but we are certainly hopeful that those with competing claims will work to resolve them peacefully.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Speaking of the Senate -- I'm trying to segue. (Laughter.)\nQ: Nice.\nQ: Traditionally, the Senate passes maybe a larger package of nominations before they go on longer recesses. I'm wondering if you are expecting any nominations to move through. And especially, I was just reading about Carla Hayden, who is the Librarian of Congress, who hasn't been able to move, along with a bunch of others.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what the Republicans in the Senate plan to do before they adjourn a day early for their seven-week recess. They've got a convention to get to. One thing I do hope that they'll do, though, is they'll give the consideration to Dr. Carla Hayden's nomination that she deserves. This is somebody that the President nominated early this year to be the Librarian of Congress. She is somebody who is eminently qualified. She has served in leadership positions at library systems across the country, most recently in Baltimore. She is somebody who has got a PhD in Library Sciences from the University of Chicago and she has taught in her field both at the University of Maryland and at the University of Pittsburgh. Her academic credentials are unimpeachable.\nShe's also the first woman nominated for the job. And I don't know what the Republican explanation is for continuing to block her nomination, but it sure doesn't seem fair. There certainly should be no reason for controversy, except that this eminently qualified woman with unimpeachable credentials is being blocked from the job by Republicans. And I'll leave it to them to explain why that exactly is the case.\nQ: So no other -- Adam Szubin, Merrick Garland?\nMR. EARNEST: She's got a particularly strong case, but she's not the only person with a strong case. And when I say a strong case, I mean people who are eminently qualified, who are devout public servants, who have unimpeachable credentials, who are eminently qualified for the job, but they're not being considered because Republicans in the Senate are going to leave a day early for their seven-week vacation recess and, again, I don't really know why they think that's appropriate. I don't think most Americans do. I'm not even sure most Republicans across the country would think that's appropriate, but I guess we'll have to check.\nGentleman in the back.\nQ: Republicans have in their political platform included the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. What kind of signal sends something like that to the Mexican Americans who have roots in Mexico and family members when the President is calling for unity in the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, this is a claim that has been propounded by the Republican nominee for President. I'll let him make whatever case he would like to make. The President's approach to the situation has been quite a bit different. The President has supported strong border security. That's why, under the President's leadership, there are more resources devoted to border security right now than at any time in American history. The President also supported a common-sense immigration reform package that would have made an even larger investment in border security and would have become law if it weren't blocked by Republicans in the House of Representatives.\nSo the President's view has been to try to use his executive authority to try to fix as much of our broken immigration system as possible. And the Supreme Court wasn't able to rule -- wasn't able to reach a final conclusion on some elements of those executive actions. But on other elements we have been successful in making sure that we're effectively using our limited law enforcement resources to implement our -- to protect our communities and to try to fix as much of our broken immigration system as possible.\nAll of that is a reflection of how the United States has benefitted from a strong relationship with Mexico. The United States government and the Mexican government have been able to coordinate effectively on a range of public safety issues. And we certainly have our differences, but we are able to coordinate effectively. And the President discussed this when he was in Canada and had an opportunity to meet with his Mexican counterpart a couple of weeks ago.\nSo it's clear that there have been different approaches, but ultimately the American people will have to decide which approach they like best.\nMegan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back to Dallas. Can you give us any additional details or color as to the President's meetings with the victims' families, with the wounded officers? Did he have any one-on-one time with the President George W. Bush?\nMR. EARNEST: The President and the First Lady did have an opportunity to spend some time backstage with President Bush and Mrs. Bush. Their paths don't cross often, but the President certainly did enjoy the opportunity that he had to catch up with President Bush a little bit. Despite their well-chronicled political differences, there's a genuine affection that the two men have for one another. I think that was apparent for those of you were reading body language onstage yesterday. I think that's been apparent in reading body language in other public settings where they've appeared, including at the dedication of President Bush's library. And when President Obama and the First Lady traveled to Selma, President and Mrs. Bush were there as well. They got to spend some time together. They marched over the bridge together.\nAll of that is an indication of the genuine affection and appreciation that President Obama has for President Bush. And by all accounts, that affection has been reciprocated by President Bush.\nAs it relates to their interaction with the families, I was not in the room while the President and the First Lady were meeting with the families of those who lost loved ones last Thursday night in Dallas. So I don't have much of their interaction to read out.\nQ: Can you say, from those conversations, including with the former President, were there any policy takeaways that the President is going to be bringing with him today? Any requests, any recommendations to move the ball forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. There were not any heated policy discussions backstage. I think most of it -- again, most of their discussions were personal or social in nature, and I also think it reflected the somber mood.\nQ: And what is the President hoping to get out of or accomplish with tomorrow night's town hall?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, tomorrow, certainly on ABC, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. (Laughter.) If Kevin is going to do it, you certainly can, too, Megan. (Laughter.) But, listen, the President is really looking forward to the event tomorrow evening, and I know that ABC is working hard to also organize a diverse audience that represents a variety of points of view. And the President is quite interested in hearing from the people who will attend and interacting with them.\nI think the President is hopeful that those kinds of interactions will both illuminate a variety of perspectives for the American people to see. I also think he's hopeful that it will illustrate what can happen when people open up their hearts to a different perspective. He's certainly going to try to do that when he's talking to people in the audience, and I'm confident that people in the audience will do that as he speaks, as well. And I think that will be not just an opportunity that could be illuminating in terms of different ideals or perspectives or potential solutions, I also think it's a pretty effective way to model the kind of conversations that the President believes should be happening all across the country.\nQ: And lastly, moving to Congress. Any reaction to House Republicans -- specifically the Judiciary Chairman and House Oversight Chairman -- requesting that the Justice Department now investigate Hillary Clinton for perjury to Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any comment on that. I'll let the Justice Department decide what they believe is the most effective way to respond to that.\nQ: What about a reaction to the way the Attorney General and the FBI Director were treated before Congress in the questioning regarding Hillary Clinton's emails?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, let me just say that I think those who had an opportunity to watch either of those hearings -- probably it was not a large number of people -- but those who did I think had an opportunity to see two genuine, well-qualified professionals who are committed to public service. And I'm referring to the witnesses, not to those who were asking questions.\nSo I'm not going to comment on -- at least for now, I'm going to withhold judgment about the way I believe that Republicans conducted themselves in those settings, and rather express to you the pride and appreciation that the White House has for those two individuals and the way they conducted themselves in public under a pretty hot spotlight.\nSuzanne.\nQ: We saw yesterday Bernie Sanders endorsing Hillary Clinton. And I'm sure the President can appreciate that moment that he had with Hillary Clinton, as well. Did he watch? And did he have a sense of relief that this had finally happened? And did he think that Sanders perhaps squandered some of the impact that he might have had because he had waited for about a month after she had the delegates to become the nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't believe the President was able to watch the event. Obviously, the event was ongoing as we were traveling to Dallas. And the President, I believe, was pretty focused on his remarks. So I don't believe that he watched the event.\nBut you all have heard previously from the President as he discussed how important it is for the Democratic Party to come together in support of a presidential candidate that's committed to the same kinds of values that the President has been fighting for the last eight years.\nThe President believes that the Affordable Care Act and the potential it has to continue to hold down the growth in health care costs while expanding quality coverage to people all across the country is something worth protecting and preserving and improving and continuing. The President believes that continuing the fight against climate change is something that the next President should do. We've made a lot of progress in digging our economy out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And the question now is really, what are we going to do to try to put even more upward pressure on wages and make sure that the next generation of Americans has the skills and training that they need to succeed in a 21st century global economy.\nThese are the kinds of values that President Obama has dedicated his presidency to. These are his priorities. And he's interested in seeing the party that he leads come together in support of a candidate who shares those values and shares the same kind of passionate commitment to advancing them. And that certainly would explain the political activity that the President has engaged in over the last month or so. And I think it will explain why the President expects to be so busy this fall.\nQ: Did he hope that Sanders would have endorsed earlier?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President obviously had at least one occasion to discuss that decision with Senator Sanders. At every turn, we made clear that Senator Sanders had more than earned the right to make his own decision about the end of his campaign, and when to end it and how to end it. And I'm not going to second-guess him from here.\nQ: And CNN had its own town hall -- I wanted to -- on my colleagues -- (laughter) -- yesterday with Speaker Ryan. And he was asked by a fellow Republican whether or not he could morally justify supporting Donald Trump because, in his words, he called him \"openly racist.\" Ryan did not push back on that characterization, but said that he would not support in any way Hillary Clinton being President. What do you think of that response? And what do you think the President thinks of that response in light of the fact that he seems to be at a point where he's trying to establish some racial reconciliation? Does he perhaps thinks that maybe there needs to be some sort of coming together with members of Congress as well to talk about race relations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think Speaker Ryan has been rightly credited and complimented for the comments that he delivered in the House of Representatives last week after the shooting of police officers in Dallas. And his commentary about the attention of the country on a range of criminal justice and law enforcement issues was well handled and I think did reflect something that the President himself has said on many occasions -- that our country is not nearly as divided as it seems. And Speaker Ryan's comments I think were a good illustration of that.\nAs it relates to his decision about which candidate to vote for in the presidential election, I'll let him answer questions about that choice in the way that he believes best reflects his views. And I'll let him do his best to justify it.\nQ: Is there a conversation that the President feels would be useful to have regarding the election and the tones, or the overtones -- or the racial overtones -- in light of the fact that he's trying to establish a dialogue with police officers and civil rights leaders and activists? Does he think that he needs to kind of take a look at the administration itself and maybe have a similar dialogue or conversations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess what I would say is that, again, words are important, and it certainly matters when we're expressing our perspective to one another that we remain open to the views of people who might see things differently or might look differently than we do. The President believes that there's real value in that.\nThe President also believes that when you're in a leadership position, like President of the United States, or mayor of a large city ,or police chief of a large police department, that your responsibility extends beyond just talk. There's a responsibility that you have to look for concrete proposals and solutions and to try to advance them. So that will be the nature of the conversation that the President has today, and I think that will be the nature of a number of conversations that take place within the administration, too. Think about what other additional things the federal government can do to support state and local law enforcement and political leaders as they make their own decisions about confronting these challenges in their communities. And that certainly is something that's worth addressing; it's also something that's worth acting on.\nJC.\nQ: Josh, a lot of transition going on in the world right now. You spent some time, I'm sure, with the President -- maybe some reflective time on Air Force One coming back from Spain. There's a whole new look, basically, to the world and to NATO. We have a first female prime minister in many years. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, is a woman. The President's choice for President, Secretary of State, may ascend the Oval Office in January. And there's even a possibility of France having a leader, Marine Le Pen, at some point in the new election. Has the President given you his thoughts or his reflections on the fact that four, possibly three, for sure, and possibly four women will be part of the NATO operation? I know you don't want to step into anything here, but it's a new world.\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's fair to say that's true when I'm answering every question.\nQ: I understand.\nMR. EARNEST: But, listen --\nQ: It's a whole new dynamic.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. Well, I think it is hard to generalize too much about this situation. Obviously, Chancellor Merkel is somebody who has led Germany for quite some time now and has done so in a way that the President has deeply appreciated. And, look, I know that she is somebody that President Bush respected deeply as well. She was able to work effectively with both leaders of our countries. I think that's a pretty good illustration of something that you've heard me say on a number of other occasions as it relates to our relationship with other countries, which is that the importance of the U.S. relationship with our allies is one that transcends the personal relationship between two leaders.\nAnd even though, for example, the President had genuine personal regard for Prime Minister Cameron, there's no doubt that he'll be able to work effectively in the six months that he has remaining in office with incoming Prime Minister Theresa May. And I'm confident that the next President will be able to work effectively with her as well.\nBut at this point, I'm going to resist the temptation to generalize too much about the women that are, in some cases, poised to play a more prominent role among our NATO allies.\nLalit.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. First, to follow up on the South China Sea. China has indicated that it is going to establish air defense zone in the South China Sea to a certain sovereignty in t region. What do you say about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, basically the reports that I've seen -- and you may have seen something different or more recent than I have -- but I think there was a comment from a Chinese official indicating that that was something that they were considering doing. And I'd just go back to what I said earlier, which is that the United States doesn't have any particular claims here. Our view is simply that the countries should resolve the claims through diplomacy and including through an arbitration process like the one that's just concluded -- the one that this Law of the Sea Tribunal has issued a ruling that all the signatories acknowledged is final and binding. And we believe that it should be treated accordingly by all of the parties.\nWe also believe that this should not be a time for provocation or inflammatory comments or actions. I think that's why you see me being careful with my word choice as well. And our hope is, is that this is not an inflection point toward a more -- to a deeper conflict, but rather is an inflection point toward the peaceful and diplomatic resolution of competing claims in the South China Sea. There certainly is the potential for that, and we are hopeful that that potential is realized because it's a potential that is clearly within the interest of the United States based on the strategic and economic significance of the shipping lanes and the transit lanes in the South China Sea.\nQ: And secondly, last week, a commander of a banned terrorist organization, Hizbul Mujahideen -- which I know was banned by U.S. and the European Union -- was killed by Indian security forces. And now the Pakistani leadership and Pakistani army has come out in support of this outfit and this terrorist leader. What does it reflect about Pakistan's commitment to fight against terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Lalit, I have to admit that I'm not aware of those reports, but I'll have somebody follow up with you on them.\nLauren, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: There was a proposal in Congress, I think in May, to make a national standard for police so that when they're using their firearm, there's a national standard of how you use it. And there was also a proposal to make this de-escalation training nationwide, mandatory among police officers. Is that something that today will be discussed, and is that something that the President backs?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not been briefed on that specific legislative proposal, but the President certainly would welcome ideas from a variety of quarters, particularly as it relates to enhanced training and increased training for police officers across the country.\nThat's just based on the experience that many communities have had -- that as they increased training requirements, as they improved the training curriculum, as they focused on de-escalation, there's been a material benefit that the community and the police department has enjoyed.\nQ: And why not make it national standard?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I wouldn't rule it out from here, but I think what's also true is that communities across the country are quite unique. The training requirements for big cities I think in some cases are different than they are for small towns. The training for a highway patrol officer, for example, might be different than the training that a police officer that more frequently works in a county jail, for example, might receive.\nSo, again, I'm not ruling out that idea, but I think there also is a strong case to be made about the need to tailor some of these training requirements to reflect the environment in which these officers are working. But, look, there is evidence to indicate that training can make a genuine difference, and how exactly that's implemented in a variety of communities is something that I'm confident will be a subject of discussion today.\nQ: The President's biggest critics have said that his speech yesterday, the first 10 minutes, were one of the most eloquent that they have seen, and then said that the speech devolved when he brought up gun control and policy. Why did he decide to do that? Why, at that moment, did he decide to bring in policy at an interfaith memorial service of five slain officers?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that I'm quite willing to accept the premise that it was a policy speech. I think what I will acknowledge, I think what the President did acknowledge, is that there are at least questions about policy priorities that must be asked when we're considering the performance of police officers across the country. And when the President talked about how there are communities in this country that have inadequate economic opportunity, inadequate schools, inadequate health care, inadequate access to healthy foods, inadequate access to job training, inadequate access to mental health care, that has the effect of making the work of our police officers even more difficult.\nBecause even as the rest of the community, the rest of the city would rather forget about those deeply entrenched problems that are plaguing one specific community, the expectation of the city and its citizens and its leaders is that police officers are the ones that are going to go and keep things quiet and make sure that the problems that are plaguing that community don't intrude on the rest of us. And you put police officers in a position where they are the after-school counselor, and the drug counselor, and the parent. Those are tough jobs. And asking a police officer to do those in addition to being a police officer is unfair.\nAnd the President has expressed his own -- I don't think he expressed exasperation yesterday, but I think there are plenty of us who are exasperated by the fact that when that dynamic leads to a situation where tensions blow over, that people act surprised.\nSo, again, I don't know if that's a policy discussion, but I guess this is the point I'm trying to make -- when the President said that, I didn't see a lot of police officers in that room shaking their head. I think I saw a lot of police officers nodding their head, if not clapping -- in part because I know that that is a point that Chief Brown made just a day earlier.\nSo to compliment your journalistic precision in noting that that observation was made by critics of the President, I just would observe that the police officers who were in the room, mourning the loss of their colleagues, when they heard the President say that didn't appear to be inclined to criticize him for doing so. In fact, they appeared to be inclined to agree with him.\nQ: I know everybody wants to go, but one last question. You put out very little information about this meeting in an hour. What you have put out does not include faith leaders. Will they be there?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll get you the list as soon as we have it. Off the top of my head, I don't know. But I'm confident that people of faith will be in the room. I don't know if any of them could be described as clergy. But I guess if you dedicated your life to working on these issues, you need to appeal to a higher power for a little strength. I know the President does.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nQ: And can you try to give out the list -- just to make sure who's coming, that they come --\nMR. EARNEST: We will make sure we get you an accurate list, and we'll have it hopefully in the next hour or so.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:09 P.M.

This group in part represents the 21st-Century Policing Task Force that I put together after Ferguson in order for us to find constructive steps that we could take that law enforcement and communities could get behind in order to make sure that we're keeping our streets safe and we are protecting and supporting police officers who are doing a very difficult job, and we can make sure that our communities are being treated fairly and that people have confidence that the law applies to everybody equally.\nThanks to Laurie Robinson and Charles Ramsey and the members of that Task Force, we came up with a set of recommendations. And the good news is, is that over the last several months since the report was issued, we have seen a lot of law enforcement officers, a lot of chiefs, a lot of departments begin to examine these recommendations and figure out how they can implement them. We've seen real progress with respect to data gathering. We've seen real progress with respect to training. We've seen progress with respect to transparency and outreach to communities.\nThe bad news is, as we saw so painfully this week, that this is a really hard job. We're not there yet. We're not even close to being there yet: where we want to be. We're not at a point yet where communities of color feel confident that their police departments are serving them with dignity and respect and equality. And we're not at the point yet where police departments feel adequately supported at all levels.\nSo what we've done here is to build off the Task Force report and find out what's working, what's not, and what more do we have to do in order to bring the country and communities around the country together and make more progress on this front.\nAnd I'll just characterize a couple of things that have been identified. And I want to emphasize that there's still a diversity of views around this table. That was by design. We have police chiefs and representatives of rank-and-file law enforcement. We've got people who have been protesting just this week. And we have sociologists, civil rights attorneys, Governors, State legislatures. So as you might expect, not everybody agrees on everything. But here are the buckets of issues that everybody identified as worthy of more work, more study, and ultimately, more action.\nNumber one, we're going to have to do more work together in thinking about how we can build confidence that after police officers have used force, and particularly deadly force, that there is confidence in how the investigation takes place and that justice is done.\nNow, that's a complicated piece of work, but it's going to involve engaging with police departments and States' attorneys, as well as communities themselves, and potentially shaping a set of best practices that ensure when something happens that people feel like it's being investigated effectively and fairly both for the police officer, but also for the families of those who've been affected. And so one of our charges, I think, is to try to find effective ways to do that. Second is continuing work on working with police departments around training, which we emphasized in the initial Task Force, but also hiring, recruitment. And one of the themes that came from a number of people is, how do we support police officers not just in terms of eliminating bias, but also dealing with the stresses and strains of the job so that they have the capacity to interact with communities and deescalate more effectively? And are there ways for us to resource that? So that was bucket number two.\nThird is data. Although we put forward a data initiative that is beginning to gather information about what's happening in police departments so that they can do a better job managing their force and ensure that what they're doing is effective, and so that communities can feel confident that they know what's happening with police forces, generally speaking, police departments, sheriffs' departments, law enforcement offices around the country either don't have good data collection or it's just in a form that people can't use.\nNow, I don't necessarily fault all the departments on that because I know here in the Federal Government, with all the resources we have, it has been really hard to just get our data systems and IT and all that set up. Some of you may remember, we had a little problem with my health care initiative—[laughter]—when it came to data and computers and so forth. So imagine if you've got a small county, small budget, they've got old computers, they don't know how to work systems. But this is an area where we think we can actually make real progress, is to help departments all across the country to put their data in a way that they can use, but also creates greater systems of accountability and so we understand what happens.\nAnd the—one of the encouraging things for me is, is that this is an area, when I was a State legislature, I was able to work with the Fraternal Order of Police and the State police organizations, as well as activists, to create a racial profiling bill that gathered data and allowed law enforcement to identify where do they think there's a problem. And because of that cooperation, we've seen improvement in Illinois around these areas. And that's something that I think we all have to spend some time thinking about.\nNext, we're going to continue to examine how we, as a Federal Government, can work effectively with local communities, because we've got 1,800—18,000 different law enforcement entities, and we're not going to be able to do for a sheriff's department or a police department what it needs to be doing. What are the best ways for us to help them do the right thing when they want to do the right thing? And are there ways in which we can support communities to lift up problems when departments are unwilling to adopt some of the best practices that are out there? So we're going to spend time looking on that.\nAnd finally, there was broad agreement that this needs to be sustained. I didn't hear anybody around this table suggest that this problem is going to be solved overnight. Because the roots of the problems we saw this week date back not just decades, date back centuries. There are cultural issues, and there are issues of race in this country and poverty and a whole range of problems that will not be solved overnight. But what we can do is to set up the kinds of respectful conversations that we've had here—not just in Washington, but around the country—so that we institutionalize a process of continually getting better and holding ourselves accountable and holding ourselves responsible for getting better.\nAnd I think we've done that with the Task Force. But what's been apparent is, is that it's not enough just or us to have a Task Force or report and then follow up through our departments. We have to push this out into communities so that they feel ownership for some of the good ideas that have been floated around this table. So I just want to say how encouraged I am by the conversation. To the American people, I want you to know that this is a pretty representative group of the folks who've been involved in the debate in this issue and have practical knowledge and are thinking each and every day about how we can prevent the tragedies we saw in Baton Rouge and in Minnesota and in Dallas. And the conversation that took place around this table is very different than the one that you see on a day-to-day or hourly basis in the media.\nAnd one of the things that I encouraged everybody here to do was to try to be as thoughtful and respectful outside of this room as folks were to each other during the course of this conversation, because I think the American people would feel more encouraged.\nNow, as I said yesterday, I do not want to gloss over the fact that not only are there very real problems, but there are still deep divisions about how to solve these problems. There's no doubt that police departments still feel embattled and unjustly accused. And there is no doubt that minority communities, communities of color still feel like it just takes too long to do what's right. And the pace of change is going to feel too fast for some and too slow for others. And sadly, because this is a huge country that is very diverse and we have a lot of police departments, I think it is fair to say that we will see more tension in police—between police and communities this month, next month, next year, and for quite some time.\nThe one thing, I think, we all have to do, though, is not paper over those differences or paper over those problems, but we do have to try to constructively solve them and not simply win talking-point arguments and not just give voice to what we're feeling at the moment. We have to, as a country, sit down and just grind it out, solve these problems. And I think they—if we have that kind of sustained commitment, I'm confident we can do so. All right?\nSo thank you all for participating. It was a terrific conversation. And they've all promised to take Michelle's call if she's wondering why I was late for dinner. [Laughter] All right?\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. Thank you, guys. If I start taking questions, I think it's fair to say that I'm going to not get out of here, and we're already way late. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. Got a whole town hall tomorrow.", "timestamp": "2016-07-13", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting on Community Policing and Criminal Justice Reform"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117844", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:22 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so we can go straight to whatever questions may be on your mind today.\nDarlene, why don't you kick us off?\nQ: Sure, thanks. Do you have anything to add at the top here to Justice Ginsburg's apology for her comments about Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not. Over the last few days, she's spoken at length, and I'll leave her to characterize her comments and her views.\nQ: Secondly, there are reports about the U.S. offering Russia some sort of military deal to go after the Islamic State group and al Qaeda in Syria. Is that something you can comment on? Or is something like that in the works?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things. The first is that, at present, the United States is not conducting or coordinating military operations with Russia. I know there's some speculation that an agreement may be reached to do so, but it's not clear that that will happen. Many of you have written about the extensive diplomatic consultations between the United States and Russia not just over the last several weeks, but over the last several weeks or more about the situation inside of Russia -- about the situation inside of Syria.\nThe case that we have made for more than a year now, or at least a year now, is that Russia should use the influence they have with the Assad regime to expedite a political solution to the situation inside of Syria. That political solution involves a transition -- moving Assad out of power in Syria. That's something that will only happen once we have been able to bring some stability to the rampant violence on the ground. And earlier this year, there was some progress made in getting many parties to agree to a Cessation of Hostilities. And at the beginning of the implementation of that deal, it exceeded our expectations in terms of the security situation on the ground. That was a positive development.\nSince that time, we have seen the security situation and stability erode. And that has dealt a setback to efforts to reach a political agreement.\nAs it relates to our military coordination, we've always made clear that we would welcome a contribution -- a military contribution from Russia, as long as they were focused on ISIL and al Qaeda's presence in Syria. Unfortunately, we've seen them devote too much of their attention to using their military might to prop up the Assad regime. I think this illustrates the contradiction that I've discussed before. There's a clear contradiction in Russia's approach to this situation. They say that they want a political transition, and they say that they're concerned about the presence of extremists inside of Syria, but yet they actually use their military might to prop up the Assad regime at the expense of -- or, in some cases, even to the detriment of -- our effort to go after extremists.\nSo the situation that we find ourselves in now is Russia is at a crossroads. Russia has to decide for themselves if they're prepared to take the kinds of actions that we've been hoping they would take for quite some time now. And the consequences for Russia are quite grave. The security situation inside of Syria continues to erode. That's a problem for Russia for two reasons. The first is, they've got a substantial military investment inside of Syria, and the pressure and stress that their host government is under right now is not good for their strategic interests in the country or in the broader region. There also is a persistent extremist threat inside of Syria that we know is capitalizing on the chaos in that country. And that chaos poses a significant threat to Russia's security situation.\nSo it's in their interest to begin pursuing a strategy that addresses that. That's certainly what the United States has done -- because we're aware of the threat that is posed by extremists inside of Syria that emanates not just from ISIL, but also al Qaeda's presence there. Russia faces that same threat; in some ways, it could be even described as worse. But their approach has been different than ours. And that's why it's time for Russia to make some serious decisions about how they want to use their influence inside of Syria, both when it comes to their diplomatic influence, but also when it comes to their military capabilities.\nSo that was a long answer to your question, Darlene. But the situation there is complicated, and I want to try to give you a detailed understanding of what our approach has been and the basic questions -- the strategic questions that Russia is facing right now.\nQ: Wouldn't such a partnership between the U.S. and Russia sort of undercut everything the U.S. has been saying all along about Russia's military involvement in Syria in the first place?\nMR. EARNEST: What we've been saying about Russia's military involvement in Syria in the first place, from the beginning, has been that they have to decide if they're going to use that military to prop up the Assad regime, or if they're going to use their military to go after extremists. And our case is that you can't do both. In some cases, Russia -- I guess to be fair to them -- they have tried to do both. But trying to do both -- trying to go after both, trying to accomplish both goals -- is a fundamental contradiction. Because to prop up the Assad regime worsens the chaos inside of Syria, and extremist organizations rely on that chaos to thrive.\nSo this is the strategy that contains this glaring contradiction that Russia has pursued for more than a year. And we've seen in that time the security situation in Syria deteriorate. We've made progress against ISIL in that time, but it's been in spite of Russia's presence and actions -- not because of them. And we are still quite concerned about the broader threat that is posed by ISIL and by al Qaeda extremists inside of Syria. And that threat is not just limited to Western targets. It's not just limited to targets in NATO countries. There's a persistent threat in Russia that they risk exacerbating as long as they use their influence to prop up the Assad regime.\nQ: Finally, really quickly, has the President -- or do you know when he will call Theresa May to congratulate her on becoming Prime Minister of Britain?\nMR. EARNEST: The President had an opportunity earlier this morning to telephone the new Prime Minister of the UK, Theresa May. The President called to offer his congratulations to her on her new leadership position. The President reiterated our oft-stated commitment to not just protecting but deepening the special relationship between the United States and the UK. And the President certainly looks forward to working with Prime Minister May in the six months that he has remaining in office to advance that goal.\nWe'll see later today if we can provide you a little bit more detail about their call.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, sort of a continuation on that. How does the White House feel about Prime Minister May's selection of Boris Johnson as the foreign secretary? He's been fairly critical of President Obama and made some controversial remarks about him. Is that an individual that you see this administration being able to work well with?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, let me start by saying that I got questions of this variety when Prime Minister Netanyahu had announced that Ambassador Dermer would be the Israeli envoy to the United States. And what I said in that situation is a thing that I -- the same thing that I'll say here, which is to restate a principle about the importance of the U.S.-UK special relationship. That relationship transcends any single personality, and choices that are made by the British government about who will represent them on the international stage are rightly choices that should be made by British leaders, and British leaders alone.\nBut whomever they choose is up to them. The decision that we will make is to seek to deepen and strengthen our special relationship with the UK, regardless of who serves in a position as prominent as foreign minister.\nQ: But they have chosen, and they chose someone who has said some pretty controversial things about the President. Is that awkward for the White House? Would you like to hear words of apology, perhaps, from the new foreign secretary before starting fresh? How do you respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I did not come out here prepared to demand an apology. I came out here to express our firm commitment to moving forward with the new leadership of the UK, to further strengthen and deepen the special relationship that exists between the UK and the United States. And the President is committed to that relationship and believes it is possible for us to strengthen that relationship because of the collective and historic commitment by leaders in the UK and by the UK people and by leaders in the United States and by the American people.\nSo we're confident that we can do this work and we'll pursue it, irrespective of specific personalities.\nQ: All right. And one follow up on the question that Darlene asked about Russia. Are the White House, the Pentagon, and the State Department all on the same page about what Secretary Kerry is bringing to those talks in Moscow?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, the President and his national security team -- well, let me say it this way. When the President is making important decisions about our foreign policy, he elicits people with different perspectives and encourages them to share their opinion. And that's the most effective way to make complicated decisions, is to draw upon the advice and insight of people with different areas of expertise and people that have different perspectives.\nAt the same time, I can tell you that when the President makes a decision, that the institutions of our country's national security are fully aligned and focused on achieving the objective that the President has laid out. And the President has got complete confidence in people like Secretary Kerry and Secretary Carter and the men and women who serve this country, under their leadership, to address these impossibly complex problems. The President has a lot of confidence and is deeply appreciative of the service of the men and women in the intelligence community and the Department of Defense and at the State Department.\nQ: Is the President concerned that opposition to this proposal from the military might be undermining the ability to make it happen?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President is -- again, the President is confident that he's getting good advice, that the efforts that are being undertaken by national security professionals -- our diplomats, military leaders, intelligence officials and other parts of his national security team -- are focused on the right things. And they've got the right priorities; they're loyal to their country. These are professionals who are grappling with a difficult problem that's got significant consequences -- not just for the millions of people inside of Syria who have been displaced, but also for broader questions about U.S. national security, particularly as it relates to the extremists inside of Syria that are trying to capitalize on the chaos.\nSo, look, I got asked this line of questioning a few weeks ago when there was the leak of a so-called dissent cable from the State Department. You heard me say at that point that the President welcomes dissenting views. The President believes that there should be a channel where people who may disagree can express their opinion. That is a valuable thing to somebody like the President of the United States who is interested in trying to make the right decision. He wants to hear the informed perspective, even of people who may not agree with him. So that's, again, that's particularly true when you're dealing with a problem as complex and as difficult as the situation in Syria.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to the issue of race that the President dealt with for a very long time yesterday -- almost five hours. There are expected to be more protests -- protests continue. What's the President's thought about that as he had Black Lives Matter, police, civil rights, faith leaders, local and state officials at that table who were said to have had real conversations -- and at sometimes very pointed and tense? What are his thoughts about these protests that continue after this conversation, and the conversations -- and the others that are supposed to follow next week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start out by reiterating something that the President said on a number of occasions. The President believes that those demonstrations and those expressions of protest should be peaceful. There's no justification for carrying out an act of violence against a police officer just because that person is wearing the badge.\nAs it relates to the conversation that the President had last night, you heard the President himself describe it as thoughtful and respectful, and the kind of conversation that people across the country could be proud of. This was a roomful of people with a variety of viewpoints on a very different but similarly complex topic. And if we're going to make progress on this issues, we're going to have to have conversations like the one the President convened yesterday -- a conversation that's not focused on winning a contest of talking points; a conversation that's not just rooted in giving people an opportunity to voice the particular emotion that they may be feeling at that point, but rather a laser-like focus on solutions. And that certainly is the focus that the President has. And you'll have an opportunity to hear more from the President tonight when he talks about this at a town hall meeting hosted by ABC.\nQ: We would love to have a town hall meeting for American Urban Radio networks, as well.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Thank you for the invitation.\nQ: You're very welcome. I hope you accept it. Now, going in a little deeper on this -- so we're told by some of the participants that there are going to be more conversations. Will the President be leading these conversations? Will it be led by White House officials? How far is he willing to lean in on this himself?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think over the last week now, you've seen the President's willingness to lean in pretty significantly. But this is not something the President is going to do on his own. This is not the kind of thing that we accomplish through the sheer force of will of one person. This is the only thing that's accomplished when men and women -- black, white, brown -- in communities all across the country respond to their own conscience.\nAnd that's where solutions are going to come from. And there has be a courage and an openness to hearing the perspectives of others and expressing one's own perspective in a thoughtful way. And that has to take place in conversations that aren't just led by the President. So one example of that is, we saw yesterday an announcement, I believe from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, indicating that they expect over the course of the next month or two to host 100 conversations all across the country. That's a start. That's something. And if those conversations are convened in the spirit of the meeting that the President had in the EEOB yesterday, then that will be a good thing. That will be an opportunity for some progress. And as I noted yesterday, each community is a little different, and so the kinds of solutions -- the kinds of perspectives that are offered, the kinds of solutions that are found are going to vary by community.\nBut ultimately, the prescription for making that progress is the same everywhere. And it's rooted in empathy and a commitment to understanding the perspective of human beings that look and think differently than we do. But trying to doggedly find that common ground is what will be required. And that's not something that the President of the United States is going to do alone. It's not something that the President of the United States is going to be able to do just by delivering a thoughtful, eloquent, powerful speech. It's not something that the President of the United States is going to be able to do in a secret meeting. It's not something that the President of the United States is going to be able to do in a nationally televised town hall meeting, whether it's on television or the radio. This is something that people across the country -- people of goodwill, people who have had their conscience aroused -- are going to have to engage in.\nQ: So what you just said -- and you gave a lot, but I'm picking out a piece to the question I asked. So this could possibly be -- this meeting could be it for the President actually leaning in, actually convening and talking himself when it comes to issues of race, having these race discussions. Is this right now where you are leaving it?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think the President has shown -- one of the things the President understands is that -- and he noted this in his remarks to all of you at the end of the meeting yesterday -- follow-through is going to be required. Again, this is not something that we're going to be able to solve in the context of one meeting or one speech, or one nationally televised primetime event. This is going to require the dogged, persistent follow-up and follow-through of people all across the country.\nSo the President will do his part. And he's the President of the United States, so his share is bigger than anybody else's. But he's not at all going to be able to do this alone. He's not even going to be able to do most of it. This is mostly going to fall on the shoulders of men and women of good will -- in law enforcement, in elected office, in faith communities, churches and mosques and synagogues, at universities, at high schools, in homes. And that's what will be required.\nThis is not the President is staying up all night to work on a speech. This is going to require the action of big-hearted Americans. And the good news is, is there are a lot of big-hearted Americans out there. And that's what gives the President some confidence that while this problem is not going to be solved next week or next month or next year, or by the next President -- maybe not even in the next generation -- but over a period of time, we surely are going to make some progress. Based on the amount of progress that we've made thus far, there's the opportunity for us to continue the effort to form a more perfect union.\nQ: And last question. I talked to Marc Morial, one of the participants yesterday -- the head of the National Urban League. He deals with economics and civil rights. And that's another component when you deal with this broader race issue. And I asked him -- I said, did you talk about that piece, and is that piece something that this administration will be able to tackle? He said he doesn't think so. He said it will come to the next President who will have to deal with that, because right now we have to deal with this issue. Is that the case? Is it right now we just have to focus on this piece versus bringing it all in and putting it all on the table?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I think the President alluded to this in his remarks on Tuesday in Dallas -- that right now we're asking our police officers to do a lot. We're asking them to do too much in many communities. There are too many communities that have been neglected and they don't have access to the kinds of schools and health care facilities and job training facilities, drug treatment facilities that other communities have the access to. And the people who live in those communities don't have access to the kind of economic opportunity that many other people do. And those are the problems that we ask our police officers to solve. And that's not fair. And there needs to be a concerted effort to try to address the root causes of inequality that many communities across the country suffer from.\nAnd again, when the President made that observation in Dallas on Tuesday, he didn't get disagreement from a lot of police officers. There were a lot of nodding heads. So I guess the point is, I think it's unwise to try to separate those two things.\nNow, Congress hasn't demonstrated the capacity to do much of anything. So if the question you're asking me is, does the President expect to be able to pass a significant legislative package that would begin addressing these inequities -- no, I don't think that's going to happen in his presidency. That is something that hopefully the next President will prioritize. Maybe that's what Mayor Morial was referring to.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two questions for you. Regarding the fate of Assad, as a matter of principle, does the President believe that Bashar al-Assad should be tried for war crimes?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard the President express a view on this. Obviously, the position of the United States is that it's quite obvious that the Assad regime has lost the legitimacy to lead Syria because of their willingness to use that country's military might against innocent civilians. And that is morally reprehensible. It is a failed leadership strategy. And it is what has caused Syria to devolve into the condition that it's in right now. And it's exacerbated a terrible humanitarian situation. It's prompted millions of Syrians to flee their homes. That has destabilized other countries not just in the region, but even in countries farther away. It has created -- it has sown sufficient chaos that extremist organizations like ISIL and al Qaeda have sought to establish a safe haven in a way that, again, threatens other countries in the region but also threatens people around the world.\nSo there are a lot of concerns, significant concerns, about what Bashar al-Assad has done and what the consequences of his actions have been. But I haven't heard the President render an opinion on this specific question.\nQ: And on a different subject. Our diligent colleagues at CNN are reporting that as early as Friday, the administration will be releasing the so-called 28 pages, the classified section of one of the 9/11 reports. How is the White House preparing for the potential fallout from that decision diplomatically with the Saudis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I don't have a specific date to confirm for you. The Director of National Intelligence has obviously been leading a process to consider the declassification of some of that material. Once that process has been completed, then the DNI will provide the declassified document to Congress. Obviously, this is a congressional document. And then ultimately leaders in Congress will have to determine how to make it public. But the question that the DNI was focused on was administering an interagency process to determine what could be released if leaders in Congress so chose.\nObviously, any time we're talking about declassifying and releasing sensitive national security information, we want to make sure that we factor in the diplomatic equities into a decision like that. So when that process is completed, we'll obviously coordinate not just with the DNI, but also with the Congress to make sure that the diplomatic equities are properly factored in.\nQ: So if you know that it's not complete, can you say what remaining steps there are?\nMR. EARNEST: As it relates to the process, I'm not even in a position to confirm that it's not complete. I'd just refer you to DNI for an update.\nRon.\nQ: Just to clarify, Secretary Kerry -- is there an agreement? Is he negotiating an agreement with the Russians about military -- what exactly -- I'm a little bit confused about where things stand.\nMR. EARNEST: Where things stand is that, right now, the United States is not conducting or coordinating military operations with Russia in Syria. It's also not clear at this point whether or not we'll be able to reach an agreement to begin doing that.\nQ: -- he's involved in a process now of trying to work out an agreement.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's been extensive diplomatic outreach for more than a year now with the Russians about the situation inside of Syria. Obviously we read out phone calls that the President has with President Putin with some regularity. One took place within the last couple of weeks. So I'll leave it to State Department officials to describe in more detail exactly what Secretary Kerry expects to do in his meetings. But I can tell you in general that diplomatic conversations with the Russians about Syria are the kinds of conversations that have been going on for quite some time.\nQ: Did you see the interview that President Assad did with NBC?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw parts of it.\nQ: The whole thing is available on the Web.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, I'll take a look.\nQ: One thing he said is that he believes that the war can be won in a few months, and that he will remain in power. Does that sound about right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our view has been for quite some time that there is no military solution to the situation inside of Syria. And as long as Assad tries to hang on to power, there will still be chaos and violence inside of Syria that's destabilizing to the broader region and that creates an opening for extremist organizations to establish a safe haven and propagate their hateful ideology.\nSo we're quite concerned about Assad remaining in power for those reasons. And that's why we have made such a strong case to the Russians to use their influence with the Assad regime to get him to step down so that we can effectuate the kind of political transition inside of Syria that can begin to stabilize the situation there.\nQ: So he pointed out that the reason that's going to happen, that he's going to stay in power and war will be won, in his view, is because of the Russians.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, and I think it's understandable why he might be getting some mixed signals from them -- because there continues to be an inherent contradiction in their approach. On the one hand, they say they're concerned about extremists inside of Syria, but yet they use -- devote significant resources to propping up Bashar al-Assad, whose mere presence exacerbates the kind of chaos that we know these extremist organizations thrive on.\nQ: But what's in the use about what Russia is doing there? It's been pretty clear that you've said, others, the Defense Department -- they clearly have been supporting the regime, they have not been attacking ISIL -- ISIS. I mean, there's no ambiguity about what the Russians have been doing. Well, I think there is. Because what the Russians say, at least, is that they are quite interested in a political transition. They acknowledge that that is necessary inside of Syria.\nTo Russia's credit -- I alluded to this earlier -- we have seen incidents, isolated situations, in which Russia has taken strikes against extremist organizations. But that's undermined by the way that they either carry out their own military operations or support Syrian operations that are focused on opposition fighters because they're trying to prop up the Assad regime.\nSo again, this is an inherent contradiction in the Russian strategy. It's not a new contradiction, but it is one that is starting to come to a head. Because ultimately, Russia needs to make a decision about how they want to confront a situation that has serious consequences for their own security. We know there are a significant number of ISIL extremists inside of Syria that travel to Syria from Russia or from areas around Russia. So they are rightly concerned about the extremist situation in Syria, as is the United States. And that's why Russia has to sort of decide what approach they want to take and what approach is going to be in their best national security interest.\nQ: What about Assad more generally? He seemed very comfortable, he was very confident, he was very dismissive of the American role in Syria -- involvement in Syria. He said that the U.S. wasn't serious about going after ISIS. He was watching the presidential elections, so on and so forth. What were your -- has the President seen this? I would think --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I doubt if the President has seen the interview. I'm sure he is aware of the news that was reported out based on the interview.\nQ: What is the White House, the President's reaction to what Mr. Assad has been saying generally?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess I would just say that this is not the first interview that he's done with a Western news organization to talk about these issues. I did not hear him say anything that is going to give anybody confidence that he will constructively contribute to a solution inside of Syria that ends the chaos, that ends the bloodshed, and that addresses the extremist threat that is present there.\nQ: And just on other -- this whole issue of policing and so forth. The President, as you say, has invested a lot of time over the last week or so into this -- the town hall tonight, the trip to Dallas, the cutting short the European vacation, the unusual meeting of the length and breadth yesterday. What is -- if you could -- what is the President's state of mind about where -- why is he doing this now? Perhaps this is an obvious question, but why is he investing so much in this now? And is he frustrated, is he hopeful? It sounds like he's -- he's talked about the limits of his rhetoric. He's talked about how these problems are going to endure -- not going to be solved, not close to resolving the tension. It sounds like he's rather frustrated and it sounds like he felt like this was a particular moment where he really needed to invest a lot of himself in this.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Ron, I think people across the country have been troubled, frustrated, concerned, scared about the kind of violence that we've seen over the last week and a half or so. And the President felt it was important to cut short his trip to Europe and come back and address it.\nNow, the President proactively addressed it while he was in Europe as well, even before the terrible tragic shooting of five Dallas police officers last Thursday night. So this is something that the President has been focused on. This is an issue that, as a public servant, the President has devoted a lot of time and expertise to. As a state legislator, state senator in Illinois, one of the President's landmark legislative achievements was being able to work effectively with law enforcement organizations -- Democrats and Republicans -- and civil rights activists, to address some of the concerns that had been raised in his home state about racial profiling.\nSo this is something the President has been focused on intellectually and as a public servant for decades now. Some of that is based on his own experience and based on his own relationships with law enforcement officials and with leaders in the African American community.\nQ: But does he feel pressure because his time in office is running out and he really needs to do something now?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is responding to I think a lot of emotions that are being expressed by Americans across the country. And that's what he's been responding to over the course of the last week. And many of those emotions that are being expressed across the country -- profound sadness about the killing of five Dallas police officers, profound concern about persistent racial disparities in our law enforcement -- those are concerns that the President shares.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, on Syria. With Secretary Kerry meeting with Vladimir Putin -- I mean, the State Department and Secretary Kerry himself will say Syria has broken every single diplomatic agreement that the U.S. has helped broker, even those that Russia has tried to midwife and agreed to on its own behalf. So why does the administration put any faith in trying to negotiate with Putin, given that he has given absolutely no reason for -- no good-faith effort thus far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me break that apart. Yes, it is true that Assad has time and time again broken commitments that either they had made or Russia had made on their behalf. I think that would explain why, just one example or one reason why Secretary Kerry is not in Damascus negotiating with President Assad right now. It's not worth the time -- setting aside the morally reprehensible actions that he's undertaken in the last several years. What's true of the Russians --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so what we have seen from the Russians has been intermittent. Russia did act constructively in helping to stand up the Cessation of Hostilities. And for the first several weeks that that was in effect, that did mitigate significant security concerns inside of Syria. It did open the door for extensive humanitarian relief to be provided to innocent Syrians who had been suffering for a long time.\nThe point is, we know that the Russian government has influence with the Assad regime in a way that can have a tangible impact on the ground. It's just a matter of President Putin deciding whether or not he cares enough about his own integrity to use it. And that's the question that they face. There's also a question related not just to their influence with the Assad regime but also to their own national security concerns. There's a significant extremist threat inside of Syria. We've talked about the risks associated with Russia walking into a quagmire. And that could have the potential of enhancing the risk back home.\nSo the incentives are pretty clear for the Russians. Our willingness to work with them effectively on shared interests is pretty clear. That's why you hear me say that the time has come for Russia to decide whether or not they're going to focus on the kinds of solutions that will address the situation in Syria and address the significant threat that the Russians face back home.\nQ: So just a few weeks of compliance under the Cessation of Hostilities is a reason to continue? I mean, we then saw the regime break the Cessation of Hostilities. So as you just said, just a few weeks of resolve that you're saying is enough to stand on their -- I mean, what is the consequence to Russia? Will the U.S. continue to provide diplomatic cover or political cover with -- continue to say we're going to keep trying to get him to do the right thing here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think that the several weeks of the over-performance of the Cessation of Hostilities, if you will, demonstrate that Russia has the capacity to use that influence with the Assad regime. They just have to decide whether or not they want to use it. So that's the illustration that I'm trying to provide here.\nI'm not suggesting that this means that they can be necessarily counted on to keep a commitment. I'm suggesting that that is an illustration that they have the capacity to keep that commitment.\nQ: And then, yesterday, an appointee that President Obama named -- Jeff Shell -- to the Broadcasting Board of Governors was briefly detained and then deported from Russia. This is just a string of recent incidents where American diplomats and personnel have been harassed -- high-profile incidents. Is this something that the President would like Secretary Kerry to raise in the meeting? And given the harassment of Americans, that doesn't set a good table for the U.S. to go in and negotiate with Russia right now if they feel that willing to assault American diplomats in the street.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to any individual case. And I'll let my colleagues at the State Department provide a readout of Secretary Kerry's discussions with leaders in Russia. I'll just say in general, as it relates to U.S. diplomats, that we regularly remind leaders in countries around the world where our diplomats are stationed that those countries have a responsibility, they have made a commitment to ensure the safety and security of U.S. diplomats that are serving around the world. We expect every country, including Russia, to live up to that commitment.\nQ: Is the President aware that Jeff Shell was detained and deported yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm just not in a position to speak to any individual cases. The President is certainly aware of specific concerns about mistreatment of U.S. diplomats in Russia.\nQ: And then a Russian national from Gitmo who was sanctioned yesterday by the State Department for recruiting militants to fight in Syria, or links to a terror group that has I guess at least in the past had ties to ISIS -- the U.S. sanctioned him as a terrorist today -- or yesterday, I should say. Does the White House believe that this particular case, given that he's a former Guantanamo detainee, makes it more difficult for the already difficult task of closing down that prison?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no. And the reason is simply this: This individual that you're referring to, this Gitmo detainee, was released by the previous administration prior to the new regime that President Obama instituted on his second full day in office to more thoroughly screen detainees before their release and to more effectively work with the countries that agreed to take these individuals in prescribing specific security constraints that could be applied to them to mitigate the risk that they would pose to the United States.\nSo our process has been much more rigorous, and the number of former Gitmo detainees that have been released after this regime was imposed, who have then been confirmed to reengage in the fight, is much, much smaller because of the newly instituted process that the newly elected President Obama instituted.\nQ: Am I understanding that to mean that -- you're talking about the 500 or so detainees that the Bush administration released, and comparing them to the standards that you have now. So should this individual not have been released? Or are you just saying that the standards at the time were not adequate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't looked at this individual's case. I don't know that anybody has looked carefully enough to second-guess a decision about whether or not to release this person and what security precautions should have been in place. I just don't know that there have been a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacking that's gone on here. But it is clear that the process that has been put in place by President Obama is one that has enhanced our national security and enhanced our ability to make progress in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay a goal that would ultimately take away a recruiting tool that is used by terrorists and save taxpayers some money.\nSuzanne.\nQ: I want to follow up on something Ron had asked about the meeting yesterday with the President. It was really an extraordinary set of circumstances to bring more than 40 people in the same room with the President. And you talked about a lot of Americans who are in pain, who are angry, who are saddened, even loss of life, before you could get these individuals together. One of the things that they talked about that was breaking ground was the fact that they were there in a format where they could hear each other, they could speak openly, and they could listen.\nI wonder if the President sees this model as something that he could use for literally members of Congress, who the American people are so frustrated with, in terms of getting them in a room, in a format in which they could express their views, express their differences, and listen -- if it was Nancy Pelosi, a Paul Ryan. Is that something that the President has done previously, or he's felt that he's attempted to do? What do you think of that in terms of moving the ball forward on his own agenda?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are certainly a number of occasions where the President has convened meetings with bipartisan groups of members of Congress. The most memorable of those would be the meeting that the President convened at Blair House with Democrats and Republicans to talk about health care reform. I also remember that early in his first term, President Obama attended a working conference of House Republicans, and the President didn't just give remarks, he actually engaged in a question-and-answer session with them.\nSo the President has certainly sought to engage members of Congress in a variety of ways. I think the real challenge with members of Congress is that it's a little harder to discern the true motive of members of Congress. And I say that with a particular focus on Republicans, of course. And let me just explain to you why.\nAfter the midterm elections in 2014, Republicans claimed to have a big governing mandate -- understandably so. They had a historically large Republican majority in the House of Representatives. They had a Republican -- a substantial Republican majority in the United States Senate for the first time in -- just doing the math in my head -- eight years. And the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying, now we can get Congress moving again. But they haven't.\nOn a whole variety of metrics, they failed to do hardly anything. It might lead one to conclude that their interest is not in trying to get something done or to pass legislation or advance an agenda; they'd rather engage in a political fight.\nAnd I think what the President noted about yesterday's meeting is that there is a genuine willingness on the part of all of the participants to not just give voice to whatever emotion they were feeling at the time, to not just try to win a contest of talking points, but to actually open up and to hear the perspective of someone else, to accomplish a goal that they share.\nRepublicans haven't even been able to do that among themselves. It's not as if Republicans are getting together, passing all kinds of legislation that they're sending up to the desk of the Democratic President, and he has to veto them. That's not at all the case. It's very unusual for the President to veto pieces of legislation because very few bills are getting to his desk. And the ones that the President has vetoed have almost all been bills seeking to specifically undo something that the President did.\nThat's not an affirmative agenda. That's not a vision for governing the country. That is a majority party that is focused on nothing or hardly anything other than obstructing the Democratic President.\nThey can do that if they want. I'm not suggesting that somehow that is -- I don't know, I don't really know what I'm saying about it. I guess what I'm saying is it's something I think that most Americans think is irresponsible, and it's something that they don't support and contributes significantly to the sense of dysfunction in Washington, D.C. And I think it explains why Congress is polling in the teens. And I think that's got to be particularly disappointing to Republican voters across the country who had been waiting for years to capitalize on the opportunity of finally having a majority in Congress where they could start passing bills.\nBut that's not at all what Republicans have done, even on bills that they themselves say that they support. So it's not even a matter of why can't Democrats and Republicans get along; why can't Democrats and Republicans try to find common ground to advance something. Republicans don't stand for anything -- Republicans who have their own affirmative agenda that they're repeatedly passing.\nQ: Has the President given up on working with Republicans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, considering that Republicans are leaving a day early for their seven-week recess -- maybe we'll talk to them when they get back. But they're very eager to rush off to that convention in Cleveland that everybody is so excited about.\nQ: I want to turn to the convention. DHS head, Jeh Johnson, said he is going to be heading to Cleveland tomorrow and on to Philadelphia to personally take a look at the sites. What is the administration's hope and expectations as they watch these two parties in the process of selecting their nominees, especially in light of the fact that we've seen racial strife, we've seen violence, we've seen protests around some of these large gatherings?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has a lot of confidence in the professionals of the United States Secret Service who will be responsible for providing security for this significant national event. I know that Secret Service officials have been on the ground in Cleveland and Philadelphia for more than a year now to coordinate with state and local officials and ensure that the proper precautions are in place to ensure the safety of not just the candidates but of the delegates to the convention and to the reporters who will be covering it.\nAs it relates to protests, there are protests at every political convention -- and there should be. People should have an opportunity to express their view, particularly if it's a view that is in disagreement with other people. The President's expectation is that people should exercise those rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly peacefully. And that's true of Democrats and Republicans.\nQ: Are the preparations ongoing in anticipation of problems of violence? I mean, is that something that they're expecting?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that law enforcement officials are prepared for a variety of contingencies. But I'd refer you to those local law enforcement agencies for contingency plans that they may have in place.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks. Just some more follow-up on the meeting yesterday. You've noted many times in this room that -- you put out the 21st Century Policing Task Force -- put out recommendations, but you can't tell forces around the country to implement them.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: I know there have been calls on the President to tie federal funding and federal grants that go to these local forces to the implementation of some of these recommendations and that that came up in the meeting. Is that the sort of thing that the President is open to, and is it something that he could do himself without Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that there is a challenge in terms of the way that the federal government interacts with the 18,000 different local law enforcement agencies across the country. Each of these local law enforcement agencies confronts a unique challenge. Each of these local law enforcement agencies has different capabilities to meet those challenges. It's why this problem is so -- it's one of the reasons that his problem is so resistant to a cookie-cutter solution.\nSo the President acknowledged in his remarks to all of you yesterday that one of the challenges for the federal government is to look at ways that the federal government can be a more effective partner with law enforcement organizations across the country. The President was pretty forthright about that.\nAs it relates to questions with regard to how we can encourage or even compel local law enforcement agencies to pursue these best practices, there's a reason that we allow citizens to organize themselves at the local level to provide policing. And there's a long tradition of that in our country, and that's not something that the President is seeking to overturn. The President is very respectful of local law enforcement. There's a reason that the President says that he's such a believer in community-oriented policing, because we know that crime-fighting efforts are going to be more effective if law enforcement organizations and the officers that wear the badge have a good working knowledge and a good working relationship with citizens in those communities.\nSo I'm not aware of any specific executive actions that are under consideration that would do something like that. But the President is certainly interested in considering, within those bounds, what we can do to encourage more political leaders and law enforcement officials to consider these best practices that have been used so effectively in other communities to address concerns in those communities.\nThere's an opportunity here; it's just a matter of leaders showing some leadership and deciding to make this a priority. There is an all-too-common of a tendency to have these problems bubble up, for there to be an intense focus on these issues for a couple of weeks while they're being debated in the media, and then they have a tendency to fall down the priority list. And this is one of those problems that is only going to be solved with sustained commitment and tenacity to a following-through.\nQ: Just on the broader question, at this meeting yesterday and in the wake of these recent incidents with race and policing, and also in the wake of Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter activists and a lot of civil rights activists have asked quite a bit of the President in terms of things he should do, places he should visit, legislation that he should pass, or executive orders that he should consider. Does he feel that those expectations that they have of what he can do in this situation are out of line with reality? Does he feel like that is in any way related to the fact that he is obviously the first African American President? Does he believe they're placing expectations on him that he can't really live up to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's a hard question for me to answer for him. I think I'll acknowledge the obvious fact, which is I think every American, regardless of race, understands the unique perspective that President Obama has on these issues. He's talked about that before. President Obama has also acknowledged that all too often his words alone have been inadequate to facilitating the kind of understanding that he'd like to see. That's not going to prevent him from trying.\nAnd the President has been quite forceful, time and time again, in making a case based on his own perspective about the outstanding work that the vast majority of law enforcement officers across this country do every single day. He's talked about how law enforcement officers have the right to come home at night at the end of their shift; that it is grossly unfair to cast aspersions and scorn on all police officers because of the illegal conduct of a few.\nThe President has made a similar point as it relates to protestors and people who are concerned about persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system. The President has made clear that it is unfair to judge every protestor based on the intemperate remarks or actions of a few.\nPresident Bush actually had a nice turn of phrase in his remarks in Dallas on Tuesday, where he talked about the need for us -- I'll probably butcher the line now, so go back and look at it for yourself -- but where he talked about how important it is for us to not judge other people by the worst examples of some people in their group, and to judge ourselves by the best intentions of our group. That distorted evaluation is part of what stands in the way of our ability to solve this problem.\nAnd again, this sort of goes to the core of the speech that the President gave in Dallas, which is, empathy will be required to solve this problem. And the President read that Scripture from Ezekiel about turning our hearts of stone into hearts of flesh, and being open to and being able to feel the perspective of a fellow human being, even if that fellow human being looks or thinks differently than we do.\nAnd again, the historic nature of this presidency is part of the reason that the President's comments about all of these things are so powerful. And the President certainly does want to use that influence in the last six months that he has remaining in office to move the ball forward.\nBut as I was describing to April, the President knows this is not something that he's going to do alone. He'll do his fair share, and his fair share is bigger than everyone else's. But collectively, as a country, we have to make a decision about whether or not we're prepared to make this a priority. People of good faith have to decide if they're willing to make this a priority. And that will be hard. It will require courage. But it's something that we'll all have to decide to do.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. When does the President plan to sign the opioid legislation that the Senate passed last night?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, as you may have seen in the statement that we issued shortly after that bill was passed by the Congress, the President will sign the bill. But the bill falls far short of what is required to address the opioid epidemic all across the country.\nThere are Americans right now who are addicted to heroin or opioids who are desperate for treatment, but can't get it because beds aren't available. That shouldn't happen in the greatest country in the world. That should not happen in a country that is founded on our values about looking out for one another.\nAnd that's why it's such a shame that Republicans have passed a bill that will give them talking points on the campaign trail, but not give money to the doctors and nurses and patients that desperately need it.\nQ: Is there a -- so no exact timing yet on the bill signing?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what day he'll sign it but we'll --\nQ: That was the question. And you said in the statement that you're going to continue to press Republican leaders in Congress to pass some sort of funding.\nMR. EARNEST: We will.\nQ: Can you explain how you're going to do that? Is there some legislative vehicle that you're looking at to include that sort of funding?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll consider all available opportunities. I mean, what's so dishonest about what Republicans are saying is they say, well, this is a bill that will provide a structure for the funding that we promise that we'll include in future budget bills. They haven't passed a budget bill. They haven't even passed a budget, let alone a spending bill.\nSo I guess the question I would ask is, what is the plan that Republicans have? In all their wisdom, the Founding Fathers gave the United States Congress the power of the purse. Nobody forced these Republicans to serve in Congress. They ran for the job. Presumably, at least some of them were familiar with the Constitution when they took office, and would understand the responsibilities that they have.\nSo it will be up to Republicans to put forward a specific proposal, and to pass it, for how they want to fund drug treatment programs in this country. I'll just remind you, President Obama put forward his own specific plan back in February in his budget for a billion dollars, fully paid for, that would expand and enhance drug treatment programs all across the country. And you'll recall, Jordan, that for the first time in 40 years, Republicans in Congress refused to even have a hearing to discuss that proposal. They refused. It's not just that they came out and trashed the proposal right when it was issued, they refused to even talk about it.\nAnd I think that is a damning assessment of their failure to fulfill their basic responsibilities to the American people. And it's only one; there are many others. But it certainly is a good one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Does the White House agree with Justice Ginsburg that her comments were \"out of line,\" and would just agree on the principle of the matter that justices have no place weighing in on the presidential campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to comment on Justice Ginsburg's interviews or the written statement that the Supreme Court apparently issued earlier today. I'll let her comments stand for themselves.\nQ: Okay. And the White House Correspondents Association put out a column expressing concern about both campaigns' treatment of the press. Does the White House share the press corps' concern that Hillary Clinton hasn't held a press conference this entire calendar year?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, what you've often heard me say in the context of assessing relations between the White House and the White House press corps is that there is built-in tensions in those relationships; that if there weren't some concern on the part of reporters agitating for more access, then you'd be falling down on the job. That same dynamic applies to covering presidential campaigns.\nSo I'm hesitant to backseat drive for other campaigns that are implementing a communications strategy and navigating their own relationship with the reporters that cover them every day. But I think what I can say, as a general matter, is that it's a good thing that that tension exists, but it also needs to be followed up by a constructive dialogue on the parts of both the reporters who are covering the campaign and the campaigns themselves to try to address those concerns. I can't speak to whether or not that's actually happening. I think all of you would probably know better than I.\nQ: But as a general matter, isn't it fair to say that the White House would agree that a presidential candidate should hold at least one press conference over the course of seven months? Isn't that a reasonable expectation, wouldn't you agree?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to weigh in on the specific tactical decisions that are made by either campaign at this point. The President has stood at this podium and certainly talked quite a bit about how important it is he believes for journalists to thoroughly evaluate the positions that are taken by the individual candidates. The process of running for President is hard, and one thing that makes that process hard is you're scrutinized by the media -- your statements, and your positions, and your past, and your plans are all carefully scrutinized. That makes the job of candidate for President of the United States really hard, but it's also critically important to the success of our democracy.\nSo, again, I'm not going to speak to the specific tactical decisions that either campaign is making, but I will just say as a general matter, the President believes that thorough, even aggressive coverage of the candidates and their positions and their statements and their record and their agenda is critically important to the success of our democracy and to the ability of voters to make a good decision when they step in the voting booth in November.\nQ: Okay. And following up on the President's meeting yesterday, clearly an issue the President cares deeply about, what can we expect the President's role to be going forward, even beyond this administration? Do you have any insight into what the President's post-presidency role on this topic might look like?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a lot to say about the President's plans after January 20th. I talked a little bit yesterday and you've heard the President talk before about his intention to be involved in the My Brother's Keeper initiative once he leaves office. This is an issue that is close to the President's heart, based on his experience growing up without a father. So that certainly is a part of the broader discussion that we're having about race and the criminal justice system and the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system. But beyond that, it's hard for me to give you much insight into what the President's plans are for once he leaves office.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks. Just maybe he saw it, maybe he didn't -- did the President at least hear about Senator Tim Scott's comments yesterday about how he's been profiled before, pulled over as many as seven times in one year. And if he did hear about that, what did he think about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I haven't had an -- I have not talked to him about that today. So I presume that he has seen those comments.\nQ: Would that surprise him, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that it would not. I think that the kind of experience that Senator Scott relayed from the Senate floor yesterday I think was notable not because of what he said but because of where he said it. It took a lot of courage from him to walk out on the floor of the United States Senate and talk so candidly about his own personal experience. But I think the kind of personal experience that he relayed is all too common across our country. So I guess that reflects my views. I don't know if it reflects the President's or not.\nQ: Understood. I'm sure you're aware that there are a number of protests that are scheduled for -- or planned, at least -- for tomorrow. There has also been some talk that the Pentagon is suggesting that DOD members stay away and avoid at any cost these circumstances. Is the White House concerned about these protests? And if so, what steps is the President encouraging not just the security staff around here at the White House but, more broadly speaking, encouraging law enforcement and others to consider as these events are planned?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, no, I would not describe the White House as concerned about these protests. I think what we have seen over the last couple of weeks is many Americans coming to the streets to peacefully express their concerns. They're exercising their freedom of speech, they're exercising their freedom of assembly, and that's a good thing. That reflects some engagement in the system. That's a good start.\nAgain, people responding to their conscience is important, but it's not going to be sufficient. We're also going to have to be able to not just protest, but also to engage in a dialogue, and to engage in the kind of conversations that open up our own perspective to the views of someone who may look and think differently than we do.\nBut look, the President has been complimentary of the vast majority of protestors that are making their views known in a way that's peaceful and reflects the proper exercise of their constitutional rights.\nQ: Quick follow on Olivier's question about the so-called 28 pages. I guess the question is that the Saudis have been saying since 2003, release them all unredacted; we want them out there because we're that confident that we have nothing to hide. The American people probably wonder two basic things. One, is there something there that is making the administration and others hold it back? And given that it will very likely be released -- at least reportedly -- perhaps as soon as tomorrow or Monday, is there anything that we should expect in terms of the White House reaction to what will be then made public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the Director of National Intelligence has been undertaking a process to declassify these documents because of the intense public interest in them. And they're working through that process. You can check with them for a status update. But ultimately, once they've completed that process, the American people will have a chance to see what's in them, and they can judge for themselves.\nQ: No concern on the White House's part.\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that the White House has confidence in the ability of ODNI to administer this process and strike the appropriate balance between protecting our national security equities and being as transparent as possible with the American people. They may conclude that there are some elements of those documents that cannot be safely released, but let's see them do their work and then we can discuss it after that.\nOther than that, I would not expect a specific or proactive announcement from the White House.\nQ: Last one. I want to play out the Assad-Russia circumstance. Given what we've seen previously in Iraq with Hussein and in Libya with Qaddafi, how does the White House, in working with Russia, prevent, in the case of a removal of Assad from a similar circumstance, not gripping that country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the focus of our diplomatic efforts to reach a political transition has been to work closely with a variety of opposition elements inside of Syria to answer this very question. It's not just a matter of President Assad leaving; it's just as important that whatever structure is put in place to replace him reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people.\nAnd working that out is no small matter, either. The opposition groups represent a variety of perspectives, and certainly have their own feelings that are shaped by some of the atrocities that have been committed by the Assad regime.\nSo this is hard work, and this is why it's not going to be solved overnight. But a system can only be erected to replace Bashar al Assad once he's committed to leave. And obviously that is not something that he's done at this point.\nMike.\nQ: What's the President's opinion of Mike Pence and what kind of Vice President he might make?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure to what extent President Obama has had an opportunity to interact with Governor Pence. I know that Governor Pence did do some important work with the administration to expand Medicaid in his state. That's something that President Obama has been encouraging Democratic and Republican governors across the country to do.\nBut look, I'll leave it to the individual candidates to determine who they believe would best complement their skills and could lead their party on the national ticket.\nQ: More specifically, what's his assessment of Governor Pence's handling of the religious freedom law, which he signed, and allowed businesses in Indiana to reject gays as customers? That's been an area of interest for the President.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen this is something that we talked about when this situation first emerged a year or so ago. Obviously the President has had a pretty strong negative reaction to state laws that are focused on taking rights away from people. But other than that, I think Governor Pence is chosen, these are the kinds of questions that he'll have to answer under the national spotlight. And again, based on my answer to Jordan, that's a good thing. The records of the candidates and their running mates should be scrutinized by the media -- not just in terms of what they're promising to do, but also in terms of what they've done in the past.\nJohn.\nQ: The President has called his selection of Joe Biden one of the best decisions he's ever made. I'm not going to get into names, and I don't think you would either, but as it relates to Hillary Clinton, what quality do you think -- based upon the President's relationship -- she should be looking for in terms of choosing her number two?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President would say that -- well, let me just couch it in terms of why the President chose Vice President Biden. I think generally I could put it in two categories. The first is, President Obama trusts his Vice President implicitly, that Vice President Biden has been exceedingly loyal to the President and to the country. And being able to trust that person who's helping you make these weighty decisions has been critical to President Obama's success.\nThe second thing is, Vice President Biden obviously brought to the ticket and to the White House a set of complementary skills and experiences that have served the American people and President Obama quite well. Vice President Biden has extensive relationships on Capitol Hill, for example. He served in the United States Senate for more than 30 years. So that extensive experience and those relationships were useful in advancing some elements of the administration's legislative agenda.\nVice President Biden served in the Senate foreign affairs committee and, based on his service in that committee, formed personal relationships with leaders across the globe. So his ability to use those relationships in negotiations have been helpful to advancing U.S. interests and advancing Obama administration policies in places as far-flung as Ukraine, Iraq, Central America, and even some places in Asia.\nQ: You've seen the names that have been mentioned in terms of the possibilities for Hillary Clinton's number-two spot on the ticket. Strong bench? How would you classify some of the names that you've seen over the course of the past few weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Secretary Clinton will have to make her own decision about which person fits the criteria that she had laid out for her running mate. Obviously the President has got warm feelings about any number of the individuals that have their names bandied about in the media. But I think the President is going to be respectful of the personal decision that Secretary Clinton has to make about who to add to the ticket.\nChris, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Josh, the Republican platform -- the draft Republican platform released by the RNC's platform committee this week is seen as veering toward the far right. In addition to anti-LGBT language that calls for overturning a Supreme Court decision in favor of marriage equality, and rescinding President Obama's guidance in favor of transgender students in schools, it also identifies coal as a clean energy source. It calls pornography a public health crisis, and other things. Does the draft platform present a threat to the progress seen in the President's administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I don't think I have a specific reaction to the Republican platform. They obviously have their own process, and they'll consider whether to ratify the platform at the convention.\nI think I'd just point you back to some of the comments that I had in response to Suzanne's question earlier about, there's a real question inside the Republican Party about what it is that they stand for. And it's not clear what they stand for because they've had Republicans in Congress for the last year and a half that haven't advanced their own agenda. They've been much more focused on just trying to throw sand in the gears of the President's agenda. And that's rather unfortunate when you consider that so many elements of the agenda that President Obama is advancing are things that Republicans at one time or another have said they supported.\nSo I used to keep here a list of all the things that Republicans say that they support that President said that he wants to make a priority too. These are things like funding for medical R&D that could advance our cancer initiative, funding for opioid addition. At one point, Speaker Ryan indicated support for poverty programs that would expand the earned income tax credit in a way that would strengthen the economy and improve the standard of living for Americans across the country.\nThe last time the minimum wage was increased, it was signed into law by a Republican President. That should be something we should be able to find some common ground on. But Republicans haven't moved on any of that, and that's been disappointing. What's most disappointing, though, is that they haven't moved on anything.\nSo again, it's not just a matter of finding common ground, it's that Republicans don't themselves know what they stand for or don't have the courage or the support to advance it. And that, I think, is the most significant factor in the dysfunction that we see in Washington, D.C. It's not a matter of Democrats and Republicans not being able to get along. It's a matter of Republicans not being able to advance even the things that they claim to believe in. And to try to cover that up, they spend all their time trying to sabotage the things that President Obama strongly believes in, even if there are things that Republicans themselves have previously said they believe in.\nSo I guess that would certainly explain the public's view of Congress right now. And it will be something that I suspect will be a subject of some discussion at the Republican Convention in Cleveland next week.\nQ: But if you won't comment on the platform itself, aren't things that are in it, like opposition of same-sex marriage and now discrimination for transgender people seeking restroom use -- aren't those things that President Obama disagrees with?\nMR. EARNEST: They are. And again, I think it is indicative of Republicans' inability or refusal to put forward their own proactive agenda. Instead -- again, based just on what you've said -- it sounds like even their party platform is focused on just trying to tear down a bunch of things that President Obama believes in. Again, I think the American people have higher expectations for their leaders who are entrusted with so much responsibility.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:50 P.M.

Let me start out by saying hi, and welcome to the White House! (Applause.) This is it! This is the main room where we do our fancy stuff. And look who's here -- you guys! Are you having fun?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: Is it exciting?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, let me just say this: This is probably one of our favorite events -- not just of our staff and the Let's Move! team, but the whole house. I mean our chefs, our butlers, our residence staff -- we all look forward to this day, watching you guys walk in, so proud and so handsome and beautiful. It just touches my heart. So we are always, always proud and thrilled to have you here. So congratulations.\nOf course, I want to start by thanking Samuel. Oh, man, what an amazing young man! (Applause.) Samuel, you continue to impress us with your poise and your intellect and your passion. You're just a cool dude. (Laughter.) And thank you for coming and introducing me. I know you have a busy schedule -- (laughter) -- and I'm so glad you had some time to fit this in. So thanks so much.\nAnd I want to join Deb in thanking our supporters -- again, PBS. WGBH Boston. Newman's Own Foundation. United Airlines -- they got you here. Yes! (Applause.) Blue Apron -- that I actually know what that is, even though I don't need it because I have White House chefs. (Laughter.) But thank you to Blue Apron.\nAnd of course, my dear, dear friend, who I call my partner in crime, who -- we just talked about it, we started talking about this issue was it nine years ago? On the campaign trail. I want to thank Rachael Ray and her team and her Yum-O! organization for all their work. (Applause.)\nTo Tanya, you've been such a rock star through all this, so thank you. Thank you so much.\nI also want to recognize everyone from the Departments of Agriculture and Education, our teams here. You guys do the hard work on the ground, and then I get to come and do a great announcement and take credit for all the work that you do. Thank you for the help not just on this event, but on so many other Let's Move! activities over the years. We're going to give them a round of applause. (Applause.) Thank you.\nAnd, of course, kids, we have to give a big shout-out to the parents and the family members and the friends who helped get you here today. These young chefs are here today because of the love and the encouragement that you all poured into these young people not just inside, but outside of the kitchen every single day. And as I greeted each of you, I tried to make sure that I thanked you parents, because you raised these wonderful, amazing kids. And I know what it means to be a parent, how much you love these young people, how proud you are. You owe them, because they got you to the White House. (Laughter.) So, kids, let's give a big, huge shout-out, thank you to our families! (Applause.) I like that high-five over there. Way to go, way to go.\nBut most of all, I want to recognize the 56 winners of the 2016 Healthy Lunchtime Challenge! (Applause.) You did it! You did it! (Applause.) Do you know that more than 1,200 kids from every state and territory in this country submitted recipes? Do you realize -- the competition was stiff! And as Deb said, after the panel of experts tasted and tested all the entries, you guys were the winners. Out of all those entries, all those recipes -- and I'm always -- thank you guys for eating all that food -- (laughter) -- you guys won. So that when I tell you -- I told each of you you should be proud of yourselves -- you should be very proud of yourselves. You earned these spots at these tables. Pretty cool.\nSo that's why we wanted to make this pretty fancy for you. I mean, we are doing everything that we do at all of our official state dinners -- our receiving line. We got tables decorated. Aren't they beautiful? Well done. (Applause.) We're going to have some fancy entertainment for you. Shhh, it's a surprise. (Laughter.) You'll hear about that later. And a lot of other stuff.\nBecause, look, you guys blew us away with your creativity and your skills in the kitchen. And as Deb said, all of the meals follow the MyPlate guidance for nutritious eating. They're affordable. You guys just hit it out of the park.\nOur young chef from Nebraska, Lauren Hinrichs, put it best -- this is what she said. Lauren, where are you? Stand up. Oh, there you go. These are her words. Lauren said, \"It hit me that we can make foods that we already love into healthier but yummy foods.\" Well said.\nAnd that's true for every single one of these recipes -- whether it's \"Alexandra's Refreshing Watermelon Salad,\" which is on your plates. Alexandra, where are you? Stand up. Stand up, sweetie. I told you we were going to be eating your salad. (Applause.) Or our \"Korean Lentil Patties.\" Who is responsible for that? Oh, there we go. (Applause.) Or our \"Teeny Zucchini Triangular Panini.\" (Laughter and applause.) That's going to be on our menu a little bit later -- and I promise that you won't have to say that out loud. Maybe you can practice that. Teeny, triangular -- no, it's tough. (Laughter.)\nSo to all of our young chefs here today, again, congratulations, and thank you for providing 56 more examples of how healthy food can also be delicious food.\nAnd that's really one of the reasons, the main reasons why we launched Let's Move! in the first place. We wanted to help kids and families across this country see how easy and fun it can be to get back to spending time in the kitchen and cooking real food. I mean, real food, right? Not food from a box, but real food.\nAnd since 2012, as part of Let's Move!, we've hosted five of these -- five Kids' State Dinners here at the White House. And altogether, we've reviewed over 6,000 recipe submissions. We've welcomed more than 270 young people and their families. And, of course, we ate a whole lot of good food. (Laughter.) That's a good thing.\nBut this event, and our Let's Move! initiative, isn't just about eating well today. This is about setting kids like all of you up for a lifetime of healthy choices. Because here's what we know: Eating healthy foods can affect how well you do in school. That's right. I can't say this enough -- the food that you put into your bodies can actually help you get better grades. And it can also affect your performance in sports and other activities too. You see, when you give your body the best possible fuel, you have more energy, you're stronger, you think more quickly. You just feel better in general all throughout the day, every day.\nBut, look, I know you guys already know that, right? Yeah, you guys know this. And that's why you all are so passionate about eating healthy -- because you know the difference that it can make in your lives. And with that passion -- and with your winning recipes -- you all are now part of a proud Kids' State Dinner tradition. You are part of a network of extraordinary young people who are leading a movement for healthy eating all across the country. You know that! It's a secret club -- (laughter) -- well, it's not so secret now. (Laughter.)\nBut you guys are moving and grooving. Let me give you an example. A young woman named Abby Cornwell represented Ohio at our Kids' State Dinner two years ago. And when she got back to school after the event, Abby realized that some kids in her community weren't eating enough fruits and vegetables. In fact, she came to learn that some of her classmates didn't have anything to eat for breakfast at all. So Abby started a program called Apples From Abby, to deliver free, fresh apples to local schools. And since that time, Abby has helped deliver over 17,000 apples to her fellow students. Pretty good, huh?\nWell, then there's Braeden Mannering, who represented Delaware at the Kids' State Dinner in 2013. Now, two days after that event, Braeden and his mom drove past a homeless man near his house. And when they got home, Braeden decided that he wanted to pack up a bag of healthy snacks and water, and he brought it back to that man. And Braeden didn't stop there. Since then, Braeden has helped deliver almost 8,000 of these healthy brown bags to folks in need. How about that? Good stuff. (Applause.)\nAnd, as you heard from Samuel, who's already doing his part -- I think, Samuel, you put it best. We've got to pay this stuff forward, and each of our ambassadors are doing that.\nSo today, we definitely want you guys to enjoy your day here at the White House. Take it all in, guys, okay? Take a lot of pictures. Enjoy the food. Have fun. But when you go home, here's what we need you to do: We need you to continue this proud Kids' State Dinner tradition by being ambassadors for the healthy eating in your communities just like Abby and Braeden and Samuel.\nWe need you to share your recipes with your friends and families, if you haven't already done so. We need you to tell them about what you saw here at the White House -- not just the fancy food and the entertainment, but tell them about how, even though we live right in the middle of a big city, we have a beautiful garden right on the South Lawn. And we here at the White House, we eat locally from our garden whenever we can -- which, by the way, is one of the most delicious and affordable ways to eat healthy.\nAnd finally, I want you all to tell everyone back home about how, every year, kids just like you help us plant and harvest our White House garden. I want you to tell them that the food you're eating today -- we used vegetables and herbs from our garden. Isn't that pretty cool? So just think about that. Just think about how cool that is -- that today, here at the White House, kid farmers helped grow the food used to prepare kid chefs' recipes. Isn't that something?\nSo let me tell you, don't ever let anyone tell you that kids can't make a difference. You all have really made the difference on this issue. You guys are the leaders. In fact, when it comes to building a healthier country, we're counting on all of you guys to lead the way. And that may sound like a big ask of you, but you guys can do this. So many of you have already stepped up in your families, in your schools, in your communities.\nJamal Bin-Yusif -- Jamal, where are you, babe? There you go. Handsome young man -- he's like, I'm right here. (Laughter.) Right there. Jamal is from Delaware, and his family had a history of high blood pressure. So Jamal figured out how to lower the amount of salt in his family's favorite dishes. Dude, way to go. Way to go! (Applause.)\nAnd then there's Jude VanderHooven -- Jude, there you go, you're right there. Jude, stand up one more time so they can see you. Jude is from New Hampshire. He helps harvest his grandparents' garden, and then he delivers the extra zucchini to a local food pantry. Thank you, Jude. Well done. (Applause.)\nSo every single one of you, you go back home and start making changes like these. If you do that, there's really no telling what you can achieve. Really. I mean, just think about it. You guys aren't even in high school yet, and you've already made it to the White House. I mean, come on. (Laughter.) That's pretty big, right? So just imagine where you could end up if you keep on working on this issue throughout school, and then go on to college -- because that's all the next step for everybody, right? College is a must, right? (Applause.) And then you carry on these habits for the rest of your lives. Imagine all the people you guys could help. Imagine all the lives you could change. You guys can do that. As small as you think you are, you can change lives.\nI know you guys can do this. I see this every year. I see the work of kids, the magic you all do. People change because of kids. They change how they eat. They change the way they think. They change the way they see one another. You guys are so powerful and you don't even know it.\nBut you guys are going to do this, right? I want you to know that I am so proud of each and every one of you. And I am sad that this is my last Kids' State Dinner, but it's not the last of the work that we're going to do on this issue, right? So when I'm old and gray, I want to see you guys looking after me, making sure I'm eating my vegetables, right? (Laughter.) When you're standing here in charge of stuff, I want you to remember, you got to take care of little old Mrs. Obama. (Laughter.)\nSo I can't wait to see everything you all do with your lives in the months and years ahead. Again, congratulations to you all. Well done. Well done. (Applause.)\nSo now were going to get ready to eat. I'm hungry. I can't wait. But before we do, I want to introduce one more person who believes deeply in you, as I do. He wanted to send along a special message by video -- because he's kind of busy, and today he was really busy. So he sent you guys a message. So let me introduce to you all my husband, President Barack Obama. He's on those screens. (Applause.) Let's hear what he has to say.\n(A video is shown.)", "timestamp": "2016-07-14", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at the Kids' \"State Dinner\""}

Over the last year, the Iran deal has succeeded in rolling back Iran's nuclear program, avoiding further conflict, and making us safer.\nDuring the past year, Iran has implemented its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran has shipped out 98 percent of its enriched uranium, dismantled two-thirds of its centrifuges, filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete, and adopted the most intrusive inspection and verification program ever negotiated for a nuclear program. IAEA reports have confirmed that Iran is complying with its commitments. As a result, all of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon remain closed, and Iran's breakout time has been extended from 2 to 3 months to about a year. The United States and our negotiating partners have also fully implemented our commitments to lift nuclear-related sanctions, and we will continue to uphold our commitments as long as Iran continues to abide by the deal.\nThe JCPOA demonstrates what can be achieved by principled diplomacy and a sustained commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. America's willingness to engage directly with Iran opened the door to talks, which led to the international unity and sustained engagement that culminated in the JCPOA.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117843", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:14 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so we can go directly to your questions.\nDarlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Thank you. A couple of questions about Nice. In the statement the President issued last night, he said that what happened there appeared to be a terrorist attack. And I was wondering if that's still the working theory -- the United States government theory that it is a terrorist attack.\nMR. EARNEST: That is still the working theory. President Hollande issued a statement last night -- he delivered a statement last night, indicating that French investigators who have the lead in investigating this incident, that they've concluded that it's a terrorist attack.\nAnd President Obama had an opportunity earlier today to telephone President Hollande and relay his condolences to the people of France on behalf of the American people. France is, after all, our oldest ally, so it should be no surprise that President Obama didn't just offer condolences, he offered significant security cooperation and any assistance that they need to conduct their investigation and to take steps to try to prevent something like this from happening again.\nThe President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, had an opportunity to telephone her counterpart today. I know Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has been in touch with his French counterpart today. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson has been in touch with the French ambassador to the United States today. And I can tell you that a range of U.S. officials in law enforcement and the intelligence community and at a variety of homeland security agencies have been in touch with their French counterparts to discuss the situation and to pledge cooperation.\nSo this is obviously something that the U.S. government will be monitoring closely in the days ahead. And we'll be offering our strongest support to the people of France in this very difficult time.\nQ: What about the method that was used, the truck that was used to mow people down? That's not something that we've seen before, or at least in the terrorist attacks around the world. What kind of clues does that method -- what does it say about --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's still a lot -- there's still much more that needs to be learned about this particular situation. There's more about this individual that French authorities have identified as the perpetrator. There's more that needs to be learned about his background, about other people that he may have associated with, anything that would provide some insight into how the attack was planned, how it was carried out, and whether or not he received any instruction or direction about doing so.\nSo we're in the early stages of the investigation. But as French authorities begin to collect the information that could help answer those questions, they'll be able to rely on the strong support and the capabilities of the United States government.\nQ: The message of the guidance from the President and the U.S. government after other terrorist attacks has been that people shouldn't give in to terrorists, they should go about their business, not make any changes in their lives. There seems to be an attack every week or every 10 days or so. So can that still continue to be the guidance or the message that's coming from the government when people are seeing things like this happen on such a regular basis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question two different ways. I think the first thing is the kind of advisories that are issued by the federal government are consistent with the advisories that the federal government is offering to federal employees, particularly U.S. citizens who are working at diplomatic facilities around the globe. And we believe that it's good practice to ensure that the information that's being shared with federal employees to ensure their safety and security, it's important that we share that information with U.S. citizens as well so they can take appropriate precautions.\nThose advisories regularly encourage people to be vigilant, to be aware of their surroundings. And we certainly would encourage people to follow that advice.\nWhat's also true is that the United States government, in an effort to protect the American people and to protect the interests of our allies around the world, expends significant resources in countering extremists, fighting terrorism, and protecting the American people. And one element of that strategy is deepening our coordination with our allies, including our allies in France. So the President is determined to continue to do that work, and in the days ahead we'll see more of it.\nQ: Lastly, on a different subject. Do you have anything at all to say about Donald Trump's choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence to be his running mate? He made it official today.\nMR. EARNEST: You mean the TPP-supporting, Medicaid-expanding Mike Pence? (Laughter.)\nQ: If that's what you want to call him.\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't have any comment on it. (Laughter.)\nRoberta.\nQ: Is there any information thus far that shows that the Islamic State is responsible for the attack?\nMR. EARNEST: French investigators are still looking very closely at what sort of connections this individual may have to extremist organizations. There have been no claims of responsibility that we have seen thus far, but we'll obviously look to that as a potential clue about what may have contributed to this particular terrorist attack. But at this point, it's too early to draw any firm conclusions about who may -- whether or not this individual had ties to a broader terrorist network or was part of a broader terrorist conspiracy.\nQ: The President is going to be speaking this afternoon. Can you tell us a little bit about what he hopes to get across?\nMR. EARNEST: The President had previously planned a primarily social gathering with diplomats from around the world who are based here in Washington, D.C. This is something that the President and First Lady have hosted here at the White House in the past. And I think it's an appropriate time for the President to speak to those diplomats about the resolve of the United States, working together with the rest of the international community, to fight terrorism and to fight extremism.\nThis is not something that the United States will be able to do alone. And in fact, we benefit significantly and our national security is greatly enhanced by our ability to cooperate and coordinate with our allies and partners around the world. That's certainly what we've seen in the context of our counter-ISIL campaign -- 66 nations that are working together to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization. But our efforts to cooperate with the international community have benefitted the United States in a variety of ways.\nThat includes our efforts to reach an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That includes our efforts to confront what our officials at the Department of Defense describe as a significant national security problem, which is climate change. And the United States did reach an agreement last December with 193 nations to take a coordinated approach to fighting carbon pollution and addressing climate change.\nThese are all good examples of the way the national security of the United States and the day-to-day lives of the American people are enhanced by the strength of our alliances and partnerships around the world.\nQ: During the Paris attack last year and the Brussels attack earlier this year, the President and other White House officials talked about a need for better information-sharing and intelligence-sharing in Europe. And I'm wondering how satisfied the White House is that intelligence-sharing has improved, and whether more needs to be done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly is more that needs to be done. But why don't we talk first about what progress we have made just since November. And the United States and France have made important progress in enhancing our security relationship. Shortly after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, the Secretary of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did succeed in working with the French to reach a new or enhanced information-sharing relationship. The sharing of that information does enhance our national security and it certainly enhances the ability of our military and our intelligence community to take steps to protect the American people.\nEarlier this year, the President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, traveled to France and completed an arrangement with her French counterpart to further enhance our security and intelligence cooperation and information-sharing with the French. This information could be used for a variety of purposes, including mitigating the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, disrupting potential terror plots and even preventing future terrorist attacks.\nThis is also part of the regular dialogue that Secretary Johnson has with his French counterpart. Homeland security is obviously something that has been at the forefront of the agenda for French policymakers, given the attacks that have occurred on French soil over the last 18 months. There is certain expertise that the United States has, and Secretary Johnson has worked to try to share that information and to share those best practices in a way that could enhance border security in France.\nWe also have sought to enhance law enforcement cooperation so that our investigative efforts on a law enforcement level can be more effectively integrated and coordinated. That's a testament to the work that Secretary Johnson has done. And again, that is something that would enhance the national security of both the United States and France.\nSo those are just a few examples of the important progress that we've made, because this is something that we did identify at the end of last year, Roberta, after the Paris attacks, that there is more that the United States and France should be able to do to more effectively integrate and coordinate on security issues. So we've made some progress.\nThere are additional steps that we believe our European allies can and should take. The best example I think that I can point to is we do believe that information-sharing among European countries needs to be enhanced. And there's some difficult work that needs to be done among European allies to ensure they're effectively sharing information. If those European countries can knock down some of the barriers that prevent that efficient sharing of information, that's only going to improve the information that the United States has access to.\nSo this is the subject of ongoing conversation with our French allies. And the kinds of things that I was highlighting here earlier in terms of the work that the Secretary of Defense, the President's counterterrorism advisor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to deepen our security relationship with France, these aren't the kinds of things that generate headlines. These aren't the kinds of things that are covered closely by the public. That's understandable. But it should be an indication to the American people that the safety and security of the American people is the President's top priority. And he has given specific direction to his team that this must be our top priority. And it's why you see these national security agencies deeply engage on these issues even when it may not be work that generates headlines. It is work that makes the country safer.\nSuzanne.\nQ: The French President, Franзois Hollande, said to his people that they have to accept, they have to live with terrorism, with terror. And at the same time, the presidential hopefuls, Hillary and Donald Trump, said that we are \"at war.\" How does the President feel Americans should think about where we are in terms of at war with terrorism and living and accepting there will be acts of terror?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has said on a number of occasions that terrorists in al Qaeda declared war on the United States on 9/11, and we've been at war with them ever since. And we've made important progress in that war. Core al Qaeda, that previously used to operate and live with impunity in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, has been decimated. There are al Qaeda affiliates in other parts of the world that are the source of ongoing concern. There are also organizations like ISIL that trace their roots back to al Qaeda. And obviously those are -- that's one extremist organization that does pose a threat and has attracted the intense attention of the United States and the international coalition that we lead.\nThe President has been pretty unequivocal about all of that. We've also been quite unequivocal about the fact that we're still waiting on Congress to pass an authorization to use military force against ISIL. I know that there are some critics of the administration who like to talk tough and suggest that somehow we need to declare war on ISIL. I would encourage those individuals to consult the copy of the United States Constitution that many of them carry around in their suit pocket. They often wield that as evidence of their patriotism. I would encourage them to consider that document carefully and actually remind themselves that it's Congress who has the authority to declare war.\nAnd it's now been almost a year and a half since President Obama sent up legislative language for an authorization to use military force that we believe that Congress should pass. And passing that authorization to use military force would send a clear signal to the American people, to our allies, and yes, to our enemies, that the United States is united behind the President's strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The truth of the matter is, our men and women in the intelligence community and our men and women in the military are doing their part to take the fight to ISIL. And it's time for members of Congress to do their job.\nQ: Newt Gingrich responded, saying that he felt that all Muslims in this country should be checked to see if they subscribe to Sharia law, and if so, they should be kicked out of the country. Does the administration have any response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: It sounds like he might need to consult his copy of the pocket Constitution as well. Our nation was founded on the principle that this is a country where people could choose to worship as they please, without harassment from the government. And that is a principle that is enshrined in our Constitution, and one that the President believes is worth protecting.\nSo observations like that, or proposals like that, rhetoric like that, is un-American by its very definition. This is also the worst possible time for leaders or aspiring leaders to suggest that somehow Americans should start turning on one another. That's exactly what the terrorists want us to do. I think the American people would expect their leaders to stand up and seek to unify this country in these trying times.\nThat certainly is going to make us safer, and it certainly is a way that we live up to the values that make this the greatest country in the world.\nMark.\nQ: Speaking of 9/11, Josh, I know we've talked about this earlier in the week -- the 28 pages -- the congressional report that it's been cleared -- Congresswoman Pelosi said that the release is imminent. Without actually having seen the 28 pages yet ourselves, can you just summarize, does the administration think these 28 pages shed any important new light on the Saudi role in the attacks on 9/11?\nMR. EARNEST: We do not, Mark. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has completed the process for declassifying as much of that material as possible. This material was actually all included in a congressional document. And that's the reason that the DNI conducted this review, declassified as much of it as they could, and then handed it off to Congress. And now it will be up to Congress to decide how and when to release this information.\nBut what you'll find once you do have an opportunity to take a look at what has been redacted -- and the vast majority of the document has been made available for public review, declassified -- what you'll find when you take a look at the document is that it will confirm what we have been saying for quite some time, which is that this material was investigative material that was reviewed and follow up on by the independent 9/11 Commission that was formed outside of the U.S. government to take a look at the attacks of 9/11. And the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission is -- or was, as they wrote -- they found \"no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded al Qaeda.\" The other thing that I would point you to is, in 2014, the FBI conducted some work as a part of the 9/11 Review Commission, and they concluded that there was no new evidence that \"would change the 9/11 Commission's findings regarding responsibility for the 9/11 attacks.\"\nSo the decision that was made by the DNI to declassify this material is consistent with the commitment to transparency that you've seen this administration impose on other areas of our national security policy that had previously been secret. It was just a couple of weeks ago that we released the updated accounting -- well, I guess that we released the accounting for first time of civilians who were harmed in counterterrorism strikes. The administration also worked diligently with the United States Senate to declassify significant portions of the report that they wrote on the CIA interrogation program. That was a subject of some controversy in the national security community. But the administration concluded that it was important to be as transparent as possible about that report.\nAnd so these pages, while they don't shed any new light or change any of the conclusions about responsibility for the 9/11 attacks, they are consistent with the commitment to transparency that the administration has tried to apply to even sensitive national security issues.\nQ: They don't really change anything. Why did it take so long to go through the declassification process? I mean, I realize that it was declassified -- it was classified originally in the prior administration. But still, even on President Obama's watch, why did it take so long? And is it, as some people think, deference to the Saudi royal family?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I know that there were a variety of considerations that were factored into the decision to declassify these 28 pages. I would acknowledge that it did take quite some time for the decisions to be made to declassify this material. I'm not in a position to discuss what may have factored into those decisions. But the President is certainly satisfied that so much of this material, even after a long wait, has now been declassified and will be available for review by the public.\nQ: I'm going to restate the question in the simplest form. Was it out of deference to Saudi sensibility?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to what factors may have factored into the length of time that it took to complete the review.\nQ: Given the attack in Nice, is Homeland Security suggesting any enhancements to U.S. security given the nature of that attack -- a truck? Or is the feeling that at this point we're protected by enough, that --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, this is certainly something that our Homeland Security professionals are already considering. As you've heard me say on many occasions, our Homeland Security professionals are constantly updating the procedures that are in place to protect the American people and to defend our homeland. So as new information emerges, that could potentially expose a new threat to the United States or to the American people. That will be thoroughly evaluated by our Homeland Security professionals. And if they determine that it's necessary to make some changes to our security posture, then they will do that. But they will be the ones to announce it.\nQ: But nothing has happened in the last hours since all this happened?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing has happened in the last 18 hours since this happened. But I guess the other thing I'd point out is, this only happened 18 hours ago. So as they learn more about this situation, and as they conduct a further investigation, it may reveal more information that does prompt Homeland Security officials to make a change in our security posture. But at this point, it hasn't.\nQ: You mentioned in terms of intelligence-sharing the problem of our European allies sharing information amongst themselves and then with the United States. What is the deficit there as a result of that? Does it mostly have to do with the U.S. knowledge of foreign fighters crossing? Does it have to do with -- I'm trying to understand what's missing in terms of what we would like to know that we don't know as a result of this problem that you identify.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you're obviously asking about information that's classified, and sensitive intelligence material. So it's hard for me to talk about it in a lot of detail. But let me try to answer your question by drawing an analogy.\nThere were conclusions after 9/11 about the intelligence collection and intelligence-sharing process inside the United States. And one of the things out of the 9/11 review was identifying what they described as stove pipes -- information that was collected by the U.S. government in one agency but not shared with all the others, including other agencies that could act on that information in a way that would enhance our national security.\nQ: I think the situation in Europe is essentially analogous to that; that there may be certain European allies that have access to a particular piece of information that may or may not be significant to their national security. But we need to make sure that there's a mechanism, and Europeans need to make sure that there's a mechanism in place so that they can share that information with other countries who may need to act on that information to ensure that safety and security of their own citizens.\nSo ultimately that's what we want our European allies to do more to address. Quite frankly, just to speak bluntly about this, the previous attacks in Paris, in November, I think illustrated this vulnerability best --\nQ: Because there was information that was available, was out there somewhere that might have been used to stop it?\nMR. EARNEST: Because the evidence right now indicates that the plotters of that attack were in Belgium, but the attack that took place was in France. So it indicates the cross-border nature of this threat, and it's why we have placed a premium on the ability of our allies to share that information effectively and efficiently even across borders. Ultimately, that will improve the quality of information that the United States receives.\nQ: Let me ask you a broader question. After the various attacks we often hear the administration say we're going to intensify our campaign against ISIS on all fronts -- cut off their finances, their air attacks, so on and so forth. But obviously this is going on now -- we've had a series of these. So, again, is there going to be some stepping-up of the administration's attack efforts against ISIS? And why do we always do this incrementally? Why isn't there -- it seems like there's always an incremental approach to this. And after the next attack we'll have more intensifying, and then again, and again. Are you -- can you tell the American people that you are -- that the administration is really doing everything possible now, not after the next attack?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, we often make announcements about the intensification of our efforts even when it doesn't come on the heels of another attack. In fact, it was just -- the last couple weeks have been -- I guess it was earlier this week, the Secretary of Defense traveled to Iraq and announced the intensification of our efforts against ISIL in Iraq by committing another 400 or so U.S. military personnel to staff up and operationalize a key military airfield that Iraqi forces had taken back from ISIL. I think that is a good example of how we are always looking for ways to intensify our efforts. And if there is one aspect of our strategy that has yielded some progress, then the President has said let's look for ways to intensify it.\nOne of the challenges we know that Iraqi security forces are facing is dealing with long supply lines. And so by establishing this base and getting it up and running, it can essentially be a logistical hub for one part of the country that is closer to Mosul, which we know is a top objective of Iraqi security forces.\nSo that's an example of how the United States and our coalition partners are constantly looking for ways to intensify our efforts. And the President makes important decisions -- measurable decisions to intensify our efforts even when an attack has not just occurred. I think that's an indication of the rapid pace of our efforts there.\nQ: What is the assessment of whether ISIS is still capable of coordinating attacks from Raqqa and elsewhere, given the effort to degrade and destroy? They can still coordinate -- even though we don't know what happened in Nice, they can still -- they're still operational, they still have the ability to do this.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen a detailed updated assessment of this, but I think it is fair to say that the United States and our coalition partners continue to be concerned about the ability of ISIL to direct attacks from Iraq and in Syria. What's also true is that capacity has been degraded. We have applied significant pressure on ISIL leaders in Iraq and in Syria, including in Raqqa and Mosul -- in such a way that we know that many of these leaders are quite concerned about their own personal security. And if they're taking steps to protect themselves that is time they are not spending in recruiting and directing terrorists overseas.\nAnother key area of progress has been closing the border between Syria and Turkey. We know that was the route that previous terrorists have used to infiltrate Europe and carry out attacks. That's much harder now than it was in the past because of efforts that have been taken on both sides of the Turkey-Syria border. But there's more work that needs to be done in that regard, as well.\nQ: And does the administration see a connection between -- on the one hand, you talk about how much territory you've recaptured, the coalition has recaptured, yet ISIS is more diffuse now and they're more -- they're in various other places -- Libya, especially; Afghanistan; elsewhere. Does the administration see a connection between that and the recent attacks that have happened in -- not Nice, but in Baghdad and Bangladesh, Istanbul?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is some speculation among some analysts that ISIL may focus more of their time and attention on carrying out attacks outside of Iraq and in Syria as their claim to establish a caliphate is exposed for the fantasy that it is.\nQ: What do you do about that? Now you have this diffuse organization that is --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say this is not a new threat, though. It is one that is potentially enhanced by the fact that we're actually making progress against their efforts to form a caliphate. But it goes back to many of the things that we were saying before -- that we've talked about before in this room. That includes our efforts to shut down ISIL's financing. We know that they rely on money from the sale of oil on the black market, from hostage taking, and from other nefarious activities to fund their activities, to fund their operations not just in Iraq and in Syria, but around the world. So we've made great strides in shutting down their financing system. There's more that we need to do.\nWe've obviously made countering violent extremism and their efforts to radicalize people using social media a top priority. And we've worked effectively with countries around the world, including nations like the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia, to establish fusion centers where we can organize our efforts to counter them online. More intelligence-sharing to track the flow of foreign fighters or other individuals that could be the source of some concern, and coordinating our efforts on that front is important, too.\nSo this is an effort that we have been working to counter all along, and we've made some progress. But it's more of a significant threat now, according to some analysts, because of the important progress that we have made in undercutting the fantasy of a caliphate in Iraq and in Syria established by ISIL.\nJon.\nQ: Let me see if I got that correct. So the theory is that we're seeing more terrorist attacks because we're making progress against the core terrorist organization?\nMR. EARNEST: This is what some analysts have concluded. This is something that we're obviously watching carefully, and we want to be mindful of this potential risk.\nQ: What does the White House see is behind what seems to be a stepped-up pace of attacks around the world? I mean, today, this morning, Secretary Kerry said that it's virtually every week that world leaders have to come out and denounce another terrorist attack. Why are we seeing more attacks around the world?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think this is --\nQ: What does the White House think?\nMR. EARNEST: There are some who are concerned -- or who are aware of the risk associated with the progress that we're making against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. Let me give you one example. We know that in at least one case, some of ISIL's recruitment efforts to foreign fighters has changed from \"come travel to Syria and join the fight\" to \"go to Libya and pick up the fight there,\" or \"consider launching attacks in your home country.\" So we know that there is some evolution in the direction that ISIL is giving to potential recruits. That's something that we continue to be very mindful of, and we're taking the steps I just outlined to Ron to try to counter that.\nBut, look, this is an organization that still has a substantial number of fighters under their command, and they still have the ability to use social media to add to their ranks. And we're mindful of that potential and we want to make sure that we continue to be vigilant about countering that effort and about taking the steps that are necessary to protect the American people.\nQ: So you ticked through a whole bunch of things. I mean, you mentioned earlier decimating al Qaeda, the increased intelligence-sharing, these fusion centers, countering violent extremism efforts, closing the border between Syria and Turkey, taking away territory from ISIS in Iraq. If it's all adding up to more attacks, is it possible this just isn't working for all the -- you're citing progress in individual, specific areas, and yet we're seeing more violence. We're seeing widespread attacks that are taking more -- not only are there more of them, but they appear to be deadlier.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jon, the concern that we have -- when you think back to the summer of 2014, when ISIL made this rapid advance across large portions of Iraq, there was this concern that there would be a large base of operations that ISIL would be able to establish in Syria and Iraq that would give them the capacity to carry out much broader, much more deadly terrorist attacks on the scale that we saw on 9/11. And what we're seeing now is different than that. What we're seeing now more often are essentially lone wolf attacks; individuals who, in some cases -- and I can't speak to the Nice case because we just don't know yet -- but in some cases, aren't even directed by ISIL but rather are radicalized by hearing their propaganda online.\nAnd the President has said for a long time that it's very difficult to prevent those attacks from taking place because they're not conspiring with other people so it's harder to catch them. But it's why we need to be very focused on things like countering violent extremism. That's why we need to work effectively with, in particular, the Muslim community. We know that some parts of the Muslim community are particularly vulnerable to the radicalizing strategy and messaging that ISIL has undertaken.\nSo the threat that we're facing now is different -- certainly different than the threat that was posed by core al Qaeda, and different than the threat that precipitated the terrible attacks on 9/11. But as you point out -- and I certainly wouldn't disagree -- they're dangerous, they're violent, and we need to dedicate significant resources to preventing them. And that's exactly what we're doing.\nQ: I understand, you're a hundred percent correct -- last question -- that it's Congress that declares wars, not the President who declares war. But on the substance, do you agree -- does the White House agree with Donald Trump that we are effectively engaged in a -- or need to be engaged in a world war right now, and that we should declare war on ISIS? I know it's not the White House to do, but does the White House think that would be a good idea or a bad idea? And this is different obviously from authorizing force.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it is.\nQ: -- a declaration of war against a terrorist organization.\nMR. EARNEST: The President, on a number of occasions, has acknowledged -- had essentially declared that the United States is at war with terrorist organizations like ISIL. The best example of this -- I was just pulling up here -- December 6, 2015, you'll recall the President gave an address in the Oval Office. And included in that address he said, \"Our nation has been at war with terrorists since al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11.\" The President has not been reluctant to apply the definition of war against the terrorists that have attacked us. And, frankly, that's why he believes it's so important for Congress to fulfill their responsibility to pass an authorization to use military force that would send a clear signal to the country, to our allies, and to our enemies that the country is united in this effort against ISIL.\nI think the thing the President has also taken pains to point out is that we are not at war with Islam, we are at war with a terrorist organization that attacked us, that perverts Islam to try to recruit people to their cause.\nAngela.\nQ: The means of this attack, of course, was a truck. When airplanes were used to attack the U.S. it was pretty immediate -- in terms of airport security and procedures. Trucks are a lot more ubiquitous, of course, than airplanes, but they can be a threat anywhere there could be a truck. Are there any thoughts or discussions going on at this point, any sort of security changes in the United States involving trucks?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any changes like that that are being contemplated right now. But as I mentioned to Ron, there's a whole lot more that we need to learn about this particular incident. And if there are some steps that our homeland security professionals conclude that we could take that would enhance our security in this country given what happened in Nice last night, then I'm confident they'll move forward with implementing those security measures.\nQ: How concerning is it to the administration that this individual was apparently not on any terrorist watch list? Many of the perpetrators of recent attacks have been known to at least some intelligence services, and this person seems to have been much more under the radar. How concerning is that that there wasn't any intelligence of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this actually goes to I think Jon's question, which is, we're mindful of the risk that is posed by a so-called lone wolf. This is an individual that doesn't have immediate or necessarily even any direct ties to a terrorist organization or a broader terrorist network or conspiracy. These are individuals who are radicalized based on propaganda that they view online. And that propaganda prompts them to carry out these violent attacks. And we're quite concerned about it. And these are -- it's very difficult to interrupt, disrupt attacks that are plotted and planned just by one person.\nThat said, the Department of Justice, on a regular basis, issues news releases of individuals being apprehended based on investigations that they've conducted, and based on what they have concluded is solid evidence that these individuals were preparing to carry out a lone wolf attack. So we do have mechanisms in place to disrupt those kinds of plots. The Department of Justice and our men and women at the FBI are quite skilled at doing so. And that's very difficult work.\nDirector Comey, when talking about an attack here in the United States, described this as a situation of looking for not just a needle in a haystack, but looking for pieces of hay that turn into needles. And that's a particularly challenging task. It's one that the FBI and the Department of Justice is quite good at, but it's very difficult nonetheless. And that's something that -- this is not a threat that just the United States faces. Countries around the world, including France, have to counter this threat as well.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I have two questions. One, I'm seeing comments by Speaker Ryan that he's leaving open the possibility of a TPP vote this year. Do you have any updates on when the President might move forward on TPP?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates at this point. The White House is committed to working with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell to try to get TPP ratified. We've acknowledged that our ability to succeed in that effort is going to require working in bipartisan fashion. And I don't just mean the Democratic President working with the Republican leaders in the House and Senate. I also mean that the Republican leaders in the House and Senate are going to have to coordinate with not just the members of their Republican conference, but they're also going to have to work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to build a bipartisan majority that's necessary to ratify TPP.\nThe President also, obviously, believes strongly that Congress should ratify the TPP as soon as possible. He believes that it includes significant benefits for the American economy, for American workers, and for American businesses. This is an agreement that includes the highest ever standards as it relates to the environment and to labor conditions, human rights, protecting intellectual property. And what's notable is that those higher standards are enforceable right inside the agreement.\nSo the President believes this is an effective strategy not just in terms of looking out for the United States economy, but also in countering the growing influence of China in that region of the world. If the United States shies away from trying to raise these standards we know that China will not hesitate to step into that breach and write standards that put American businesses and American workers at an even further disadvantage. So when it comes to a strategy of preparing the country to counter globalization and to counter China, the TPP is our best bet.\nQ: And on a different subject, on Zika funding. Yesterday, House and Senate appropriators sent the White House a letter asking if the HHS Secretary could reprogram funds and maybe provide more funds for Zika that way. Any interest in doing that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any announcements like that. You know that the Department of Health and Human Services has already reprogrammed several hundred million dollars in funds for this effort. We did so even though we continue to be quite concerned about the potential of the risk that's posed by Ebola. So to further take away funding from that effort in order to fight Zika could potentially be counterproductive. So it's something that we're quite reticent to do.\nI think what we'd simply like to see is Congress respond to the request from Democratic and Republican governors across the country, and from our public health professionals who laid out exactly what resources they need to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And the President put forward that legislation back in February. And here we are almost five months later, and Congress hasn't approved that request. And that's a source of deep disappointment to the President. It's also something that means that we're right now not doing everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And that's something that Republicans in Congress have to account for.\nPhilip.\nQ: The French authorities released the name of the driver of this truck, the man who was shot by police. Can you confirm at this point that that name was not known by any U.S. authorities?\nMR. EARNEST: Philip, I think you have to check with the intelligence community for any information that they may have had about this individual. I know that what French authorities have indicated is that he was not somebody who was considered a terrorism suspect there. He was someone whose interaction with law enforcement had been limited to him committing some relatively low-level crimes. Again, it underscores the lone wolf attack threat that is particularly hard to disrupt.\nQ: You've described this as a terrorist attack, as have French authorities. What if it is confirmed there are no ties at all to any terrorist groups for this man? There appeared to be first indications that what all of this might have been a bad personal situation for him, a case of depression, a divorce he was going through, nothing to do at all with terrorism. Would you still stick with that definition if that was the case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I noted at the beginning, we still need to learn more about this individual, about his potential motivation for carrying out this terrible attack, and his potential links to any other organization. So we'll certainly take a close look at the situation and we're going to support the French investigators who are obviously leading the investigation. There are significant capabilities that we have to assist them, and we won't hesitate to use them.\nQ: Finally, the Secretary of Homeland Security traveled to the French Embassy here in Washington I believe to sign a book of condolences. Are there any plans for the President to do something like that in the coming days?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll keep you posted if something like that happens. I believe Secretary Johnson did sign the condolence book, but also had an opportunity to spend some time with the French ambassador to the United States. But we certainly intend to continue those kinds of consultations in the days ahead.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, can you explain the thinking when you use the word \"terrorism\" on this? Because when you look at something like -- we're not sure what happened in Nice -- but something like what happened Orlando versus a centralized, developed conspiracy plot that was centrally planned and executed, the terms used by the White House are the same, but the situations seem to be different. Can you explain how you see -- and the though in using that term?\nMR. EARNEST: In this case, we're using that term because French officials have. French officials are the ones --\nQ: -- it's not the U.S. position that it's an act of terrorism, it still appears to be terrorism.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, our view is that it's terrorism because that's what our oldest allies in France have concluded. They're the ones who are conducting this investigation. As they learn more about this investigation and as they need to update their assessment -- I'm confident that they will -- we'll work with them on that investigation. And if they update their assessment, we'll do the same. But as the President said last night, this appears to be terrorism. That appearance was confirmed by the French President whose government is leading this investigation. And obviously the people of the United States stand shoulder to shoulder with our oldest allies in France as they confront terrorism in a variety of forms.\nQ: Because, I mean, it seems these days, regrettably -- I mean, the flag is at half-staff more often than not. The President is making comments like this. I mean, there's a litany of attacks to read off. I'm not going to. But it's becoming almost a memory, a recitation of what we do each time these attacks happen. I mean, is this just going to be not the new normal for the world, but the new normal of just what happens every time there's an attack, it's assumed and just explained as this is part of us winning on the battlefield, that this kind of lashing out is going to happen? I mean, the public would look at that and say, in some ways it's that much more terrifying that it's unanticipated, that it's just in the streets, people are celebrating, rather than a centralized plot.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think you're drawing an important distinction, because there are differences between a large-scale terrorist conspiracy and the kind of lone wolf attacks that we have seen. Those large-scale terrorist conspiracies have the potential to be much more bloody, to be much more violent, to claim many more deaths than the kind of lone wolf attacks that we've seen in the last few weeks. We certainly grieve for those who have been lost in these lone wolf attacks. We certainly expend significant resources and are vigilant about trying to prevent those lone wolf attacks. But they are materially different. And they require a different strategy, but a strategy that we are just as committed to implementing in order to protect the safety and security of the American people and of our allies.\nQ: You have on the calendar I think next week this anti-ISIS coalition meeting happening in Washington. Is that going to change in any way? Is the White House going to be more involved in that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a meeting that Secretary Carter is convening with his counterparts who are making a substantial military contribution to our counter-ISIL efforts. He's organized that meeting. It had been previously scheduled for the end of next week, I believe at Andrews Air Force Base. I don't have any updates to agenda at this point. But if anything like that -- if there are any updates to that agenda, we'll definitely let you know.\nQ: And finally, Secretary Kerry said today when he was in Moscow that -- when he was talking about Nice, these things happen on a weekly basis now. And he called Syria the single greatest incubator for terrorism in the world right now. Does the White House agree with that? And in some ways, doesn't that raise questions if the plan for the past five years not to use large-scale military force should be revisited? I mean, is that an acknowledgement that there was some overestimation of this being contained?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess what I would say is simply that we have been concerned about the potential terrorist threat from ISIL for more than two years now. And the President formed an international coalition of more than 66 nations to counter it -- not just to counter it, but to degrade and ultimately destroy it, because we're mindful of the terrorist threat that emanates from there.\nI think what the President would argue is also true -- and we're happy to have this argument -- is that as difficult and violent and complex as this problem is, the ultimate solution is not a military one. We can certainly apply significant military pressure and devote significant resources -- and we have; the Commander-in-Chief has ordered it -- against ISIL, to counter them, to degrade them, and to ultimately destroy them. But the root cause of all of this has been the failed political leadership of Bashar al-Assad, that --\nQ: But in terms of the estimation of this being a massive, as Kerry said, the biggest incubator of terrorism in the world, was that underestimated by the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, based on the fact that we've built a coalition of 66 nations and dropped 13,000 airstrikes -- or conducted 13,000 airstrikes against them, based on the significant commitment of resources not just in the military effort, but to organize our diplomatic efforts to counter their financing, to try to prevent them from recruiting foreign fighters from all around the world, I think the strategy that we have implemented against them has yielded important progress.\nBut the President acknowledged at the beginning that this was a long-term proposition and it's going to require some tenacity and some follow-through; that we wouldn't be able to chart our progress in a straight line; that there would be some days where we'd feel like we were making progress, and occasionally we would suffer a setback. And anytime you see the loss of so many innocent people in an allied nation, that certainly is a day where it's hard to feel like you're making a lot of progress. And that's why we mourn with our French allies. But it certainly is not going to diminish our commitment. If anything, it's only going to further energize our multilateral, multinational effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nAgain, I say all of that, even before we understand what the true motivations were of this individual. But whether or not this person had ties to ISIL, the President is committed to making sure that we do everything possible to protect the American people.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. As expected, the Intelligence Committee has published the previously classified 28 pages. For the people who are not awash in this on a daily basis, what does the White House want the American people to take away from the fact that these pages are now public, they're now available? And what's the White House's perspective on -- now that they are out there, how the White House feels about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the number-one takeaway for people should be that this administration is committed to transparency even when it comes to sensitive information related to our national security. Just within the last couple of weeks, the administration published for the first time the numbers of people who -- of civilians who were casualties from U.S. counterterrorism operations. The administration worked to declassify key elements of the CIA interrogation report that was written by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee. And today's announcement was part of an effort to try and be as transparent as possible about investigative material that was collected in the context of investigating the terror attacks of 9/11.\nThis information, even as it's now publicly available, does not change the assessment of the U.S. government that there's no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded al Qaeda. I'm reading that language because that's the language that was included in the 9/11 Commission Report. And the 9/11 Commission was able to draw on the information that's been declassified today as they wrote their report. They were able to do follow-up interviews and to further investigate those leads. Those leads didn't really turn up anything as it relates to specific evidence about the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funding al Qaeda.\nQ: Interesting how they use the expression \"senior Saudi officials.\" Does that mean to suggest that maybe there were some lower-level Saudi individual government officials that may have been involved in providing material support for those who were at least alleged to have been co-conspirators to the 9/11 attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't looked lately at the 9/11 Commission Report, but certainly that is a comprehensive document that was written to provide as much information as possible about what contributed to the attacks on 9/11.\nQ: You've also said on a previous occasion that the White House was against JASTA. And I'm just wondering why there would seem to be this disconnect between the White House's view of JASTA when there are so many in the United States Senate, overwhelmingly so, who feel like this may be a very good idea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, this just goes back to a long-held principle here about the risk that this legislation would pose to --\nQ: It's pretty narrow, wouldn't you agree? At least the way it's currently --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, based on the analysis that's been conducted by our lawyers here in the U.S. government, the way that this law is written could open up U.S. companies and even potentially U.S. personnel to vulnerabilities when they're engaged in actions or doing business or conducting official government work overseas.\nThere is an important principle related to sovereign immunity. And when you're the most powerful country in the world, you're invested in the idea of sovereign immunity, given how deeply the United States is involved in so many other countries.\nSo we believe that's a principle worth protecting. And that is the concern that we have with this legislation, at least the way that the most recent draft was put forward. Doesn't have to do with any specific country, but rather has to do with our concern about a specific principle that benefits the United States and private U.S. interests in countries all around the globe.\nQ: Were there some instances, just broadly speaking, as a general matter, that the White House found concerning in the review of some of those 28 pages? Specifically, there seems to be a suggestion that there may have been material support provided to one of the so-called co-conspirators -- possible co-conspirators. And yet, while you've said there's no specific proof, were there areas where the White House or White House Counsel or others were concerned some things didn't exactly pass this so-called smell test? They look suspicious, to be blunt.\nMR. EARNEST: The White House has not conducted an investigation into this matter. And the reason we didn't have to do that is that there was a 9/11 Commission that was formed that looked at all of this evidence. They were able to follow up on this information. They were able to follow these investigative leads. I know that they did interviews in a variety of other countries to pursue those leads. And despite all of that investigative work, they didn't find any evidence that the Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded al Qaeda. That's the definitive word of the outside experts who took an unvarnished look at this particular situation. And that conclusion is unchanged by the release of these 28 pages today.\nQ: Okay. Last -- it is Friday; figured I'd throw a little sports your way. Deflategate is apparently over. Tom Brady says he's no longer going to push it; he's going to be out of four games to start the NFL season. Big reaction from the White House? I know the President is a big football fan. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is Jimmy Garoppolo's big opportunity here.\nQ: That it is.\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see if he makes the most of it.\nConnie.\nQ: Are you concerned about the open-carry laws in Ohio, especially with the convention starting next week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Connie, as you know, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the head of the United States Secret Service have been focused for more than a year -- about providing security for the Democratic and Republican conventions in Philadelphia and Cleveland, respectively. Homeland security officials have been in close touch with local law enforcement in Ohio and Pennsylvania to ensure the safety and security of not just the party nominees but the convention delegates and the reporters who will be in attendance.\nI know that their efforts are focused on also protecting the First Amendment rights of people who may want to register a protest at the conventions. And those rights will certainly be protected. But the President's expectation is that people who are protesting should do so peacefully. And law enforcement officials will certainly be in place to ensure that those rights are protected.\nQ: There will be a lot of people carrying guns.\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there are some limitations about their ability to do that in the context of the conventions, but I'll let the Department of Homeland Security speak to that.\nQ: On a different matter, the reception this afternoon. Will the President try to get any antagonistic ambassadors together, such as Israel and some of the Arab countries?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think the President would consider those ambassadors antagonistic.\nQ: -- try to get them together?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know of any specific meetings that the President is planning. I think this is largely a social event, but I think it will have a more serious tone in light of the terrorist attacks in Nice last night.\nQ: Thank you, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: John.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Your decision not to weigh in on Donald Trump's choice for his vice presidential pick, is it just a today thing? Do you plan on weighing in as the process moves forward?\nMR. EARNEST: No, at this point I don't anticipate having much of a reaction to his selection of a running mate.\nQ: \"At this point,\" meaning as the process moves forward you may indeed weigh in on this ticket?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't entirely rule it out, but I don't have any plan in the back of my mind to weigh in on this.\nQ: And on Nice, with what happened in Nice, in your view, in the President's view, was this unique to France? Could something like what happened in Nice happen right here in the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned in response to a couple of other questions, the President is deeply concerned about the threat posed by lone wolf attacks. And it takes a variety of forms. We're coming up on the anniversary of the shooting at military recruitment installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee. I think there are some aspects to that investigation that are still ongoing, but many people could describe and I think have described that as a lone wolf attack.\nObviously, we saw the situation in San Bernardino, where a husband and wife carried out an attack. Again, they were not directly connected to a broader conspiracy or terror plot, but at least there is no evidence of it at this point. But they were able to just coordinate among the two of them, and it was very difficult to disrupt that plot. We saw a similar dynamic in Orlando.\nSo we understand that this is a threat that needs to be countered and confronted. And it is a different threat than the one that was posed by the 9/11 co-conspirators, for example, that killed more than 3,000 Americans on one day. So this threat is different. It's of a different scale. But it's one that's still dangerous. It's one that the President and the rest of his national security team is determined to prevent.\nQ: Is there anything that you can say to lessen the level of anxiety that people may feel after seeing the horrific video they saw in Nice, France?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of things. I think the first is that it's important for the American people to understand just how rigorously their government is focused on preventing that kind of violence in the United States. That's why we have worked so hard to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. It's why the President, when he first took office, had identified decimating core al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a top priority. It's why the United States works so closely with our partners around the world, because by cooperating we know we can be more effective in countering this threat.\nSo the American people should take some solace in knowing that this is the highest priority of the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest country in the world. And we've enjoyed important successes in limiting that threat. It's not uncommon for the Department of Justice to make announcements about these kinds of plots being disrupted, even though we know how difficult it is to disrupt these plots.\nWe've been able to chart the progress that we've made against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. Iraqi forces, with the support of our coalition, have taken more than 45 percent of the land inside of Iraq that ISIL previously controlled, and we've enjoyed some important strategic victories in Fallujah and at this military airbase in Qayyarah to -- that's evidence that we continue to make progress against ISIL.\nAnd the President continues to be mindful of the other threats that are out there. The President continues to be mindful of the al Qaeda threat that we know is present inside of Syria in the form of Nusra. We're certainly aware of the threat that is posed by ISIL in places like Libya, where they're also trying to capitalize on the chaos there.\nWe're also aware of the threat that emanates from al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa. And this is actually something that our French allies deserve a lot of credit on. We have relied significantly on the French to use their expertise and their history in that part of the world to counter al Qaeda extremists in places like Mali. They've made a lot of important progress in the world, and the United States is safer as a result of their efforts. It's an indication of how we benefit from the capacity and determination of our allies in France. That's also why we're going to stand with them, even in this difficult time for their country.\nJanet, I'll give you the last one. I saw you had your hand up back there.\nQ: Thank you. Yesterday the guidance announced that President Peсa Nieto will be here next Friday. Do you have any more to share on that? Why does this meeting come about now? And anything that you can give us on what the two of them will be talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Janet, it will be an opportunity for President Obama and President Peсa Nieto to continue the conversation that they had in Ottawa, Canada just a couple of weeks ago. The two of them had an opportunity to have a bilateral meeting there in the context of the North American Leaders Summit. And I would anticipate that they'll continue their conversations on a range of topics.\nObviously, our security coordination with Mexico is important to both our countries. I'm confident that will be a prominent aspect of their conversation. Mexico is a part of the TPP agreement, and I'm confident we'll have an opportunity to talk about ways that we can deepen our relationship -- our economic relationship in a way that will have benefits for both our economies and workers in both our countries.\nThe President is optimistic that we can substantially transform our economic relationship with Mexico, because by signing on to the TPP agreement, Mexico is signing on to higher labor and environmental standards that will allow U.S. businesses to compete on a more level playing field. When President Obama ran for office in 2008, he promised to renegotiate NAFTA. That's exactly what he did in the context of TPP.\nObviously, Mexico wouldn't be enthusiastic about signing it if they didn't also believe that the greater economic opportunity that would be created by these deeper economic ties would also be good for their economy, too.\nSo this is a win-win, and we certainly believe that Congress should act to approve it. And that will be the subject of some ongoing discussion between the two leaders as well. But we'll have more next week to preview their meeting.\nQ: Any ideas if el Chapo or immigration will be coming up in those meetings?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident there will be a discussion about immigration. President Peсa Nieto is obviously aware of President Obama's tireless work to try to fix the many aspects of the U.S. immigration system that's broken. Implementing those reforms and repairing those problems would only strengthen the relationship between our two countries. That's part of the reason that the President has made that a priority, and I'm sure that will be the subject of some discussion too.\nI don't know what to -- I don't know to what extent they will discuss the status of Mr. Guzman. Obviously this is something that the United States Department of Justice is looking at. And we have a tradition in the United States where we separate those law enforcement activities from political interference, and so I don't know to what extent the President will be able to discuss it.\nWith that, let me do what I find to be a personally rather exciting week ahead. (Laughter.) We'll get to why in a couple of days here.\nOn Monday, the President will award Lieutenant Colonel Charles Kettles of U.S. Army the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry. Then-Major Kettles distinguished himself in combat operation in Vietnam on May 15, 1967, and is credited with saving the lives of 40 soldiers and four of his own crew members. A rather remarkable story, so if you haven't had a chance to take a look at it I would encourage you to do so. But should make for a moving ceremony here at the White House on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House. On Wednesday, the President will host the White House Summit on Global Development at the Ronald Reagan building. The President will bring together development leaders, public and private sector financing partners, civil society, diplomats and entrepreneurs to mark our global progress and catalyze further developments.\nOn Thursday, a day we've long awaited, the President will welcome the Kansas City Royals to the White House to honor the team and their 2015 World Series victory. I'm very much looking forward to Thursday. That afternoon, the President will deliver remarks at an Eid reception here at the White House.\nAnd then on Friday, the President will welcome President Enrique Peсa Nieto of Mexico to the White House. The visit follows the two Presidents' meeting during the North American Leaders Summit in Ottawa on June 29th, as well as the meeting at the White House in January of 2015. The President looks forward to hosting President Peсa Nieto in Washington to build upon the significant progress made at the North American Leaders Summit, and to reaffirm and deepen our bilateral partnership on a range of issues. And we will obviously have more to say about that important bilateral meeting next week.\nQ: -- press conference?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that there will be a news conference associated with that bilateral meeting. So stay tuned for the details on that.\nHave a good weekend, everybody.\nEND 2:26 P.M.

Today, the Obama Administration is announcing new steps to maintain U.S. leadership and win the next generation of mobile technology with the launch of a $400 million Advanced Wireless Research Initiative led by the National Science Foundation (NSF). This new program will enable the deployment and use of four city-scale testing platforms for advanced wireless research over the next decade and builds upon the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Spectrum Frontiers vote yesterday.\nThat vote made the United States the first country in the world to make vast quantities of high-frequency millimeter wave spectrum available for both licensed and unlicensed use. This spectrum, in combination with other spectrum already available, promises to enable faster speeds, quicker response times (\"lower latency\"), and increased capacity in future wireless networks. The United States leads the world in 4G deployment in significant part because of its spectrum-first, flexible-use strategy, and the Administration expects the United States to continue to spearhead future wireless innovations because of the FCC's actions yesterday.\nThe Advanced Wireless Research Initiative announced today will also build on President Obama's seven-and-a-half-year track record of accomplishment in wireless and wireline broadband policy, and on the nearly $150 billion in 4G LTE investment by wireless operators since 2010. It includes an $85 million investment in advanced wireless testing platforms by a public-private effort, including NSF and more than 20 technology companies and associations; plans by NSF to invest an additional $350 million over the next 7 years in academic research that can utilize these testing platforms; and complementary efforts by other Federal agencies. These platforms, and the fundamental research supported on them, will allow academics, entrepreneurs, and the wireless industry to test and develop advanced wireless technology ideas, some of which may translate into key future innovations for 5G and beyond.\nCollectively, these spectrum policy and research efforts will accelerate the deployment of a new generation of wireless networks that are up to 100 times faster than today. These super-fast, ultra-low latency, high-capacity networks will enable breakthrough applications for consumers, smart cities, and the Internet of Things that cannot even be imagined today. Possible advances in the next decade could bring:\n• Mobile phones and tablets that can download full length HD movies in less than 5 seconds, 100 times faster than 4G (6 minutes) and 25,000 times faster than 3G (26 hours).\n• First responders and emergency room doctors who get live, real-time video and sensor data from police vehicles, ambulances, and drones, along with patient vitals and medical records—all before the patient arrives at the hospital door.\n• Semi- or fully-autonomous vehicles that can communicate with the outside world and with each other to improve travel efficiency and safety.\n• Factories equipped with always-connected smart manufacturing equipment that self-diagnose and repair themselves before they break.\n• Gigabit-speed wireless broadband available in businesses, public transportation stations, stadiums, campuses, schools, malls, parks, and other public spaces.\n• Virtual reality training environments and simulators that allow entry-level workers to develop and demonstrate skills in high-demand fields like solar energy installation—anytime, from anywhere.\nMORE THAN SEVEN YEARS OF INNOVATIVE WIRELESS POLICY\nPresident Obama has prioritized wireless and wireline broadband since his first day in office. Through forward-thinking spectrum policy initiatives, targeted Federal spending, and aggressive private investment, the United States has become a world leader in wireless, with more than 98 percent of Americans having access to fast 4G/LTE mobile broadband at speeds up to ten times faster than 8 years ago. This progress is about more than just faster download speeds: Internet access provides substantial economic benefits across the U.S. economy, including for job-seekers and workers, as highlighted by a recent report from the President's Council of Economic Advisers.\nOne of President Obama's first actions was to sign the Recovery Act to help the nation recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The Act funded nearly $5 billion in broadband investments, including support for more than 114,000 miles of broadband infrastructure, especially in under-served areas, to connect anchor institutions and wireless towers. The Administration also supported targeted tax incentives to provide wireless companies with the incentives and certainty they needed to invest tens of billions in infrastructure and services. And President Obama challenged Federal agencies to streamline permitting for broadband and wireless infrastructure deployment, and supported \"Dig Once\" policies for fiber-optic backhaul along America's roads and highways.\nPresident Obama also committed the Administration to making available 500 MHz of Federal and nonfederal spectrum by 2020 for mobile and fixed wireless broadband use. Through concerted effort from nearly two dozen Federal agencies, the Federal Government has made available half of that amount already, including raising more than $40 billion for American taxpayers through the FCC's Advanced Wireless Services 3 (AWS-3) auction last year. The FCC's ongoing incentive auction promises to make available up to 126 MHz of additional prime spectrum.\nRecognizing the increasing complexity of the wireless world, the Administration has also made sharing a central part of its wireless policies, reflecting the recommendations of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Commercial companies and Federal agencies are collaborating to explore innovative new ways to free up valuable airwaves. Sharing was a key to the unprecedented success of the AWS-3 auction, and underpins the first-of-its-kind three-tier access system established for the 3.5 GHz band. The Federal Government has also taken bold steps to increase the availability of unlicensed spectrum by opening up white spaces between television channels and is exploring the possibility of expanding access to the 5 GHz band that currently supports advanced Wi-Fi services.\nAPPLYING THE SUCCESSFUL LESSONS OF 4G TO THE WIRELESS CHALLENGES OF TODAY AND TOMORROW\nDuring the last seven and a half years, wireless use has exploded, underpinning significant U.S. economic growth and productivity. More than 350 million smartphones, connected tablets, and wearable devices are in use across the United States, more than double the number from a decade ago. Wireless networks carry more than 100,000 times the traffic they were supporting in 2008. Millions of Americans rely daily on products and services provided by new wireless companies and applications that could only be dreamed of a decade ago. The President remarked 6 years ago that \"[t]he world has gone wireless and we cannot be left behind.\" And indeed, the United States has surged ahead, with U.S. competitive advantage in connectivity forming a foundation for rapid growth in the global information and innovation economy.\nMuch of the credit for this growth is due to America's innovators, entrepreneurs, path-breaking wireless network companies, private-sector investors, and the unparalleled productivity of America's workers. In addition, America's success in 4G is also a story of a clear policy strategy that favored making spectrum available early and establishing flexible-use rules to enable innovators and entrepreneurs to define the future of wireless technologies and applications. By avoiding a rigid, top-down, standards-setting process and technology roadmap, the American spectrum strategy enabled a flourishing of technologies and ideas, and an open competition that allowed successful technologies to win in the marketplace of ideas.\nAlso contributing to the American success story in wireless is another clear policy strategy—sustained Federal investments in fundamental academic research that leads to technology breakthroughs that drive growth in the American economy. Time and time again, Federally-funded researchers have contributed to breakthroughs that have helped to harness airwaves once considered low value—including the high-frequency bands that the FCC just opened up. In addition, NSF, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and other Federally-funded academic research into new channel access, antenna, modulation, and other technologies has made important contributions to the 3G and 4G revolutions, the broad deployment of Wi-Fi, millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies, and new dynamic spectrum-sharing arrangements.\nToday, the importance of ultra-high-speed, high-bandwidth, low-latency wireless connectivity is only increasing. The burgeoning Internet of Things will add significantly to wireless needs, with 50 billion connected devices anticipated globally by 2020. Devices are also expected to continue to consume ever-greater amounts of data—traffic in North America is expected to grow at a 42 percent compounded annual growth rate between 2015 and 2020.\nTo meet these demands, the United States must build on the successful strategies it used to become a leader in 4G, starting with spectrum. The FCC took a critical step yesterday in this regard with its Spectrum Frontiers ruling. The rules adopted yesterday open up vast amounts of spectrum for new uses and offer additional spectrum flexibility, while preserving a path forward for continued and expanding Federal and satellite deployments. The FCC also proposed opening up even more spectrum in the future, to ensure that the United States remains a leader in wireless technology.\nToday's announcements to invest in cutting-edge fundamental wireless research will leverage the Commission's efforts to make spectrum available for flexible use.\nINVESTING MORE THAN $400 MILLION IN ADVANCED WIRELESS RESEARCH\nNSF today is committing $50 million over the next 5 years, as part of a total $85 million investment by NSF and private-sector entities, to design and build four city-scale advanced wireless testing platforms, beginning in FY 2017. As a part of this investment, NSF also announces a $5 million solicitation for a project office to manage the design, development, deployment, and operations of the testing platforms, in collaboration with NSF and industry entities.\nEach platform will deploy a network of software-defined radio antennas city-wide, essentially mimicking the existing cellular network, allowing academic researchers, entrepreneurs, and wireless companies to test, prove, and refine their technologies and software algorithms in a real-world setting. These platforms will allow researchers to conduct at-scale experiments of laboratory-or-campus-based proofs-of-concept, and will also allow four American cities, chosen based on open competition, to establish themselves as global destinations for wireless research and development.\nNSF is also announcing plans to invest $350 million over the next 7 years in fundamental research on advanced wireless technology projects that can utilize NSF's share of time on these platforms. This will allow a broad base of NSF-funded experiments on potential breakthrough technologies to be taken from proof-of-concept to real-world testing at scale, here in the United States.\nCOMPLEMENTARY FEDERAL ANNOUNCEMENTS TODAY\nIn addition to these testing platforms and research investments, the Administration is also announcing additional coordinated efforts and investments across Federal agencies to help accelerate the growth and development of advanced wireless technology.\n• In addition to its support for the testing platforms and fundamental research, the NSF is also announcing:\no Two prize challenges to enhance wireless broadband connectivity. The first challenge will focus on providing rapid, large-scale wireless connectivity to restore critical communication services in the aftermath of a disaster. The second will seek innovative solutions to provide low-cost, seamless connectivity in urban areas, leveraging fiber optics in overhead light poles.\no A $6 million jointly-funded solicitation with Intel Labs on information-centric wireless edge networks, with the goal of developing the ability to process very large quantities of information with response times of less than one millisecond.\no A $4.7 million joint NSF- and Academy of Finland-funded solicitation to support joint U.S.-Finland research projects on novel frameworks, architectures, protocols, methodologies, and tools for the design and analysis of robust and highly dependable wireless communication systems and networks, especially as they support and enable the Internet of Things.\no Federal funding of a Millimeter Wave Research Coordination Network to foster biannual meetings of international researchers to identify emerging challenges, share cutting-edge research, and form collaborations around millimeter-wave broadband wireless networks.\no A  large-scale networking platforms \"Communities of Practice\" workshop designed to gather international expertise on best practices that can successfully guide the advanced wireless research testing platforms being announced today.\no Follow-on NSF workshop on ultra-low latency networks, with the goal to identify research challenges and pathways that need to be solved in order to support ultra-low response times across networks.\nFind more information here to learn more about these NSF announcements.\n• DARPA is announcing its plans to demonstrate the viability of the technologies being developed for its latest Grand Challenge, the Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2), within the testing platforms being announced today. The SC2 competitors are reimagining spectrum access strategies and developing a new wireless paradigm of collaborative, local, real-time decision-making where radio networks will autonomously collaborate and reason about how to share the RF spectrum.

MSOD has been successfully tested and used to record spectrum utilization 24 hours a day, seven days a week, over a period of several years, using data from multiple sensor installations. Additional networked sensor sites are being installed this fall, and spectrum analysis capabilities are being added.\no ITS will be expanding its Urban and Indoor Radio Frequency (RF) Propagation Measurement campaign that advances urban and indoor propagation research by making advances in measuring and characterizing radio frequency propagation characteristics in both urban and indoor environments to include four more cities to provide additional data to improve the accuracy of RF propagation models in urban terrain.\no ITS will begin utilizing its expertise in electromagnetic compatibility research this fall to perform electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) analyses and conduct empirical tests of potential device-to-device interference in a mobile network operating within an independent fixed network infrastructure. Lab tests and simulations will be performed initially, followed by experimental validation of results in the field.\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ANNOUNCEMENTS\nReflecting the importance of these research testing platforms to the development of wireless technology, more than twenty private-sector companies and associations in the U.S. wireless industry have cumulatively pledged more than $35 million in cash and in-kind support to the design, development, deployment, and ongoing operations of these testing platforms.

He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117891", "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. I just had the opportunity to greet each of you in person. And we welcome all of you. Each year, the diplomatic corps comes so that we can say thank you for the partnership between our nations and our peoples and reaffirm our shared commitment to promoting security and peace and human dignity around the world.\nObviously, we come here with heavier hearts than normal. Overnight in Nice, we witnessed another tragic and appalling attack on the freedom and the peace that we cherish.\nToday our hearts are with the people of France and with all the innocent men, women, and so many children who were hurt or killed in this sickening attack. This includes Americans that we know of: a family from Texas, a father and young son—just 11 years old—who were there on vacation. Their family, like so many others, are devastated. They're grieving. They need all the love and support of our American family as they grapple with an unimaginable loss and try to get through what are going to be very difficult days.\nAnd so on behalf of all of us, I think, I want to welcome our friend, Ambassador Araud of France. And I had a chance to meet with him right before I came out so that he knew that it's not just the United States of America, but the entire world that stands in solidarity with the people of France during this difficult time.\nI spoke to President Hollande earlier today, and in addition to conveying deep condolences, I reminded him that France is America's oldest ally and one of our strongest. We owe our freedom to each other. Americans and French have stood together for two centuries. And I told President Hollande that we will stand united now: in our grief, in our praying for the many who are injured, many of whom are still fighting for their lives. And we pledge to stand with our French friends as we defend our nations against this scourge of terrorism and violence.\nAnd this is a threat to all of us. We don't know all the details, but what we know is the capacity of even a single individual to do extraordinary harm to our people, to our way of life. A lot of nations represented here today have been impacted this year and in previous years. In recent weeks, we've seen heinous attacks, inspired or directed by ISIL, here in the United States, in Turkey, in Iraq, in Bangladesh, in Saudi Arabia. And these terrorists are targeting and killing innocent people of all backgrounds and all faiths, including Muslims. And I know I speak for all of us when I say that these individuals and these networks are an affront to all of our humanity.\nMany of the nations that are represented here today are part of our global coalition against ISIL. And I want to take this opportunity to say once more: We will not be deterred. We will not relent. We're going to keep working together to prevent attacks and defend our homeland. We are going to keep taking out ISIL leaders and pushing ISIL back in Syria and Iraq. We're going to keep standing with our partners, from Africa to Afghanistan. And we are going to destroy this vile terrorist organization.\nAnd in contrast to these terrorists, who only know how to kill and destroy, we're going to win this fight by building; by never giving up on diplomacy to end the Syrian civil war; by working with partners around the world, including Muslim communities, to push back against hateful ideologies that twist and distort Islam, a religion that teaches peace and justice and compassion. We will defeat these ideologies by offering a better vision of development and economic progress, so people, especially young people, have more hope and opportunity and are less susceptible to extremism and violence in the first place. And we will continue to promote political opportunity and democracy so citizens have a say in their future.\nAnd we will win this fight by staying true to our values: values of pluralism and rule of law and diversity and freedoms—like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly—the very freedoms that the people of Nice were celebrating last night on Bastille Day. In the wake of last night's attacks, we've heard more suggestions that all Muslims in America be targeted, tested for their beliefs; some deported or jailed. And the very suggestion is repugnant and an affront to everything that we stand for as Americans.\nWe cannot give in to fear or turn on each other or sacrifice our way of life. We cannot let ourselves be divided by religion, because that's exactly what the terrorists want. We should never do their work for them. And here in the United States, our freedoms—including freedom of religion—help keep us strong and safe, and we have to be vigilant and defend our security and our freedoms.\nAnd all of us, whatever nations we represent here, I think have to step back and reflect on what we are doing to eliminate this kind of chronic violence. It's been a difficult several weeks here in the United States. But the divide that exists is not between races and ethnicities and religions; it is between people who recognize the common humanity of all people and are willing to build institutions that promote that common humanity, and those who do not—those who would suggest that somebody is less than them because of their tribe or their ethnicity or their faith or their color. And those impulses exist in all our countries. And those impulses, when we do not speak out against them and build strong institutions to protect people from those impulses, they can take over, they can be unleashed. So that all of us have responsibilities, not just a few.\nI want to say that even as we are relentless against terrorists, it's also worthy for us to recognize that our nations have worked together for security and peace and human dignity around the world. I want to thank so many of your countries for the partnership that we've forged and the progress that we've achieved together over these past 8 years: in rescuing the global economy and securing vulnerable nuclear materials; a comprehensive deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; halting the spread of Ebola, and thereby saving countless lives; in Paris, the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change; a new sustainable development set of goals to end extreme poverty and promote health and education and equality for all people, including women.\nAnd through the efforts of many of you, we've continued to try to move beyond old conflicts: supporting the transition to democracy in Burma, forging a new partnership in Vietnam, deepening our new chapter of engagement with the Cuban people, helping to support the efforts in Colombia to end the decades-long conflict. That's the power of diplomacy. That's what's possible when our nations and our peoples work together in the spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect.\nAnd what a contrast to the death and nihilism that terrorists offer. What a powerful reminder of the progress and opportunity and hope that we can advance when, as nations and as peoples and as individuals, we refuse to be defined by our differences alone, and we remember that we are all part of one human race. Even on difficult days like this, that's what gives me hope. And that's what should give us all hope. Because on this planet of more than 7 billion people, the hatred and the violence of a few ultimately is no match for the love and decency and hard work of people of good will and compassion, so long as we stand up for those values and so long as we answer those who would undermine those values.\nI'm very proud of the work that we've done over these last 7½ years in partnership with your countries.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117791", "text": "Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. Aww. [Chants of Trump, Trump, Trump] Wow.  On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.\nSo I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again.\nI want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop.\nWe need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. [applause]\nI want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.\nAnd as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.\nNow, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing.\nIraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.\nWe also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back.\nI found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.\nBut I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. [applause]\nGovernor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control.\nMike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. [applause]\nAnd I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.\nThirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.\nBut I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that. [applause]\nOn top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it. [applause]\nWhat a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence. [applause]\nMike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over.\nAnd Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order. [applause]\nHillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money.\nBut I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made.\nYou take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.\nAnd I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.\nSo Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause]\nNo, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.\nThink of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes.\nBut I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.\nBut they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.\nThey're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause]\nSo they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that – delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen.\nAnd what we're doing... [applause]\nAnd what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause]\nAnd I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president.\nAnd we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.\nI saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?\nAnd they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.\nAnd I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause]\nAnd they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause]\nBack to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall.\nSo I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.\nI have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.\nI said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.\nI said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible.\nFolks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause]\nAnd he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter]\nIt costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.\nAnd if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy.\nBut they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter]\nIndiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause]\nIncredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state.\nAnd it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual.\nGovernor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.\nIt's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A.\nIndiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.\nAnd besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor.\nIndiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause]\nIf you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal.\nTake a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause]\nSo it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs.\nIndianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy.\nUnder Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause]\nIndiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast.\nGovernor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.\nSo with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?\nYou know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.\nBut I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year – but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause]\nAnd when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them.\nSo when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country.\nThe turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse?\nSo even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause]\nSo with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117792", "text": "On behalf of my family here and looking on, would you join me in thanking Donald Trump, Melania, and his entire family for the sacrifices that they are making to make America great again? [applause]\nAnd I thank Donald Trump, for the confidence you've placed in us, and I accept your invitation to run and serve as vice president of the United States of America. [applause]\nYou know, I come to this moment deeply humbled, but with a grateful heart. Grateful to God for his amazing grace. Grateful to my wonderful wife, Karen, and our three incredible kids, Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey, and grateful to this builder, this fighter, this patriotic American who has set aside a legendary career in business to build a stronger America, Donald J. Trump. [applause]\nAnd let me say, having had the privilege to spend time with this man and his family out of the limelight, I know what all of America will soon know even better: These are good people. Donald Trump is a good man, and he will make a great president of the United States of America. [applause]\nDonald Trump understands the frustrations and the hopes of the American people like no leader since Ronald Reagan. The American people are tired. We're tired of being told. We're tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. We're tired of having politicians in both parties in Washington, D.C., tell us we'll get to those problems tomorrow.\nAnd as Ronald Reagan said, we're tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves. Donald Trump gets it. And he understands the American people. [applause]\nI truly am deeply humbled to be at his side today. And when I got this call last Wednesday, I could only think of that ancient question: Who am I, oh, Lord, and who is my family that you have brought us this far?\nSo let me try and answer that question for a few minutes. Now, people who know me well know I'm a pretty basic guy. I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order. [applause]\nAnd while I'm currently -- I currently have the privilege of serving the state that I love, I'm really -- I'm really just a small-town boy who grew up in southern Indiana with a big family and a cornfield in the backyard. Like Donald Trump, my grandfather immigrated to this country, and in many ways, I grew up with a front row seat to the American dream.\nI watched my mom and dad build everything that matters: A family, a business, and a good name. The heroes of my youth were John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I actually started in politics in the other party. But when I came of age, I was inspired by the ideals and the eloquence of our 40th president, and I became a Republican.\nThe most important thing in my life was when 31 years ago I married the girl of my dreams, Karen Pence, who will make a great second lady of the United States of America. [applause]\nAnd while this office is an extraordinary office to which to aspire, the highest role I will ever play is D-A-D. And I'm a proud father of a college student, a graduate turned writer, and a United States Marine. [applause]\nYou know, my career, I ran for Congress before the Republican revolution, led by Newt Gingrich in 1994. I wasn't successful. By the time I got elected to Washington, D.C., sometimes I felt like I was elected after it was over. From almost my first day in Congress, I found myself battling the big spenders in both political parties, whether opposing No Child Left Behind, the prescription entitlement, or the Wall Street bailout, I fought every single day for taxpayers and fiscal responsibility when I was a member of the Congress of the United States. [applause]\nAnd after the Republicans lost the Congress in 2006, I was actually unanimously elected to serve in leadership, and we fought back against the Nancy Pelosi Congress. We opposed Obamacare. We opposed their tax increases. We opposed their cap-and-trade. And I was part of the team that won the Congress back from Democrat control in 2010. [applause]\nAnd all that happened before I went back home again to Indiana. But I want to say I answered this call for two reasons, first, because I know from firsthand experience that strong Republican leadership can bring about real change, just like we've seen in the Hoosier state.  And, secondly, because Hillary Clinton must never become president of the United States of America. [applause]\nNow, on the first point, I know what I'm talking about. You know, in Indiana, we prove every day you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education, roads, and health care. We like to say Indiana is a state that works.  And it does. [applause]\nIndiana works because Republican principles work every time you put them into practice. Today, we have a $2 billion surplus and the highest credit rating in the nation. And since I became governor, Hoosier businesses large and small have created nearly 150,000 net new jobs. And we have more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana. That's what Republican leadership gets ya. [applause]\nAnd let me say from my heart, that's what the no-nonsense leadership of Donald J. Trump will bring to Washington, D.C. [applause]\nBut elections are about choices. Elections are about choices. And I also joined this ticket because the choice could not be more clear. The stakes could not be higher. Americans can choose a leader who will fight to make America safe and prosperous again and bring real change, or we can elect someone who literally personifies the failed establishment in Washington, D.C.\nSeven-and-a-half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies have weakened America's place in the world and stifled our nation's economy. Terrorist attacks at home and abroad, grim and heartbreaking scenes from France just a few short days ago, the attempted coup in Turkey all attest to a world spinning apart.\nHistory teaches us that weakness arouses evil. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy of leading from behind, moving red lines, feigning resets with a resurgent Russia and the rise of ISIS is a testament to this truth of history, and we must bring a change to America's stand in the world. [applause]\nWe cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends. America needs to be strong for the world to be safe. On the world stage, Donald Trump will lead from strength. He will rebuild the arsenal of democracy, stand with our allies, and hunt down and destroy the enemies of our freedom. [applause]\nAnd at home -- and at home, the choice is just as clear. Where Donald Trump wants to cut taxes, Hillary Clinton plans to raise taxes, on working families, small businesses, and family farms. Where Donald Trump is committed to repeal Obamacare, lock, stock and barrel... [applause]... Hillary Clinton looks at Obamacare as a good start and wants to take Bernie Sanders' path down to single-payer socialized medicine. Where Donald Trump supports an all-of-the-above strategy and will end the war on coal, Hillary Clinton actually promised an energy plan that would close American coal mines and put coal miners out of work.\nWhere Donald Trump wants to build a wall and temporarily suspend immigration from countries compromised by terrorism, Hillary Clinton plans to ignore the Supreme Court, re-impose executive amnesty, and would increase -- increase -- our refugee program by more than 500 percent.\nAnd where Donald Trump will appoint justices like the late Antonin Scalia, who will uphold our Constitution, Hillary Clinton will appoint Supreme Court justices who will legislate from the bench, abandon the sanctity of life, and rewrite our Second Amendment.\nTo every American who shares our convictions, I say to you, join us. For the sake of our security, for the sake of our prosperity, for the sake of a Supreme Court that will never turn its back on our God-given liberties, let's come together as a party and a people and a movement to make America great again. And that day begins when Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States of America. [applause]\nThank you for the honor. Thank you for your support. And God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118062", "text": "Melbourne, A.U. - Today, Vice President Joe Biden announced the signing of three Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) that will make available an unprecedented international dataset to advance cancer research and care. An MOU between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, and Macquarie University (MU), Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI), Garvan Institute of Medical Research (GIMR), and Bioplatforms Australia Limited (BPA) in Australia will facilitate scientific collaborations in the field of clinical proteogenomic studies and their translation to cancer care (the study of genes and their protein products, their role in cancer development and progression and possible targets for therapies). Additionally, the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria have signed separate MOUs with the U.S. NCI that will create a general framework of collaboration for promoting and conducting high-quality research and data-sharing to strengthen the evidence base necessary for cancer prevention, treatment, and management.\nBy aligning efforts through these MOUs, an unprecedented international dataset will be made publicly available and data will be contributed as soon as it is available for use by cancer researchers and physicians around the world - with an expected minimum of 8,000 patients in the United States and 50,000 Australians by 2021.\nThese agreements will establish a new collaboration to facilitate the sharing of cancer?associated clinical research data, genetic and other molecular information (DNA, RNA, and protein), targeted tests, and subsequent public dissemination of products and data to the research community. The MOUs between the U.S. NCI and the Australian state governments of New South Wales and Victoria will establish joint steering committees that will meet at least one a year to develop strategic plans for collaboration, recommend areas and topics for joint workshops, develop collaborative research project solicitations, facilitate the expedited review and clearance of collaborative proposals, and foster other joint activities to advance research on cancer.\nAs a testament of continued support of clinical proteogenomics, the government of New South Wales is set to announce during the Vice President's visit an additional investment of $6 million dollars (AU) and the Victorian Cancer Agency will announce a new U.S./Victorian Cancer Fellowship program that will provide support for up to four senior researchers a year to the United States to conduct cancer research in areas including, but not limited to, cancer proteogenomics.\nBackground\nOn his recent trip to the Vatican, Vice President Biden issued a call for an international commitment of all developed nations to consider renewed and focused cancer investments in ways that improve patient outcomes by creating publicly accessible sets of research and patient data, including those data sets that can represent the global diversity of populations, people, and cancers.\nVice President Biden has travelled to a number of leading cancer centers in the United States and to venues around the world to engage experts throughout the community - researchers, oncologists, patients and patient advocates, industry leadership, and data and technology experts, among others - in conversations about cancer. Through these conversations the Vice President identified the barriers and opportunities that he could most usefully take on as part of an initiative known as the Cancer Moonshot.\nPurpose and Scope of the Collaboration\nThe purpose of these MOUs is to facilitate scientific and programmatic collaborations between research agencies and institutions in the United States and Australia for basic and clinical proteogenomic studies and their translation to care. This will build upon the recently launched U.S. Applied Proteogenomics OrganizationaL Learning and  Outcomes (APOLLO) network (https://medium.com/cancer-moonshot/apollo-network-canserve-cancer-patients-through-collaboration-15a3530ed57e) and Australia's Proteome of Human Cancer (http://www.cmri.org.au/Research/Research-Facilities/ProCan.)\nThe specific areas covered by the collaboration include three distinct areas:\nAdvancing Proteogenomic Research:\nFollowing the blueprint from the U.S. Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium [hyperlink: http://proteomics.cancer.gov], researchers will develop sites that collect high-quality, clinically annotated, primary, and untreated tumor specimens from patients with specific cancer types in order to improve the understanding of the proteogenomic (both the genomics of the tumor and the expression of those genes as proteins) complexity of tumors. This focus will improve the understanding of tumor resistance and/or toxicity to therapy and the ability to predict treatment response by examining drug response or toxicity. Researchers will use proteogenomic signatures that support an increased understanding of tumor biology with the potential of facilitating the identification of which treatments can be used to target a specific patient's tumor.\nResearchers will develop and utilize innovative data analytic tools to analyze growing proteogenomic datasets. The algorithms and software from these projects will be made open source.\nPreparation and Training of the Proteogenomic Research Workforce:\nThis agreement includes a program to train and exchange scientists with expertise in proteogenomic data, including training in working with clinical healthcare data and registry data and integration with analysis of molecular data.\nDissemination and Sharing of Information:\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, regulation, and policy, resulting products and data will be made public to the research community upon the main manuscript being accepted for publication. Where applicable, scientific findings will be published jointly involving individuals from each institute.", "timestamp": "2016-07-16", "title": "Fact Sheet: At the Victoria Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vice President Biden Announces New Memoranda of Understanding Between the United States and Australia, New Funding as Part of Cancer Moonshot"}

It's been a challenging couple of weeks: the shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge, the protests, the targeting and murder of police officers in Dallas. It's left all of us struggling to make sense of things at times. Now, I know that for many, it can feel like the deepest faultlines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed and even widened.\nBut the America I know—the America I saw this week—is just not as divided as some folks try to insist. I saw it on Monday, when I met with law enforcement to talk about the challenges they face and how too often, we ask our police to do too much: to be social workers and teachers and guardians and drug counselors as well.\nI saw it on Tuesday, when I traveled to Dallas for the memorial service for the five courageous officers who died in the line of duty, even as they were protecting protesters with whom they may have disagreed.\nI saw it on Wednesday, when I hosted police chiefs, Black Lives Matter's activists, State and local leaders, and others for a discussion that lasted more than 4 hours, a discussion on more steps we can take to continue supporting the police who keep our streets safe and instill confidence that the law applies to everyone equally.\nAnd I saw it on Thursday, at a town hall in DC, where we talked about how there is no contradiction between honoring police and recognizing the racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system and trying to fix those discrepancies.\nNow, these conversations were candid, they were challenging, even uncomfortable sometimes. But that's the point. We have to be able to talk about these things honestly and openly, not just in the comfort of our own circles, but with folks who look differently and think differently than we do. Otherwise, we'll never break this dangerous cycle. And that's what America's all about: not just finding policies that work, but forging consensus, fighting cynicism, and finding the political will to keep changing this country for the better.\nThat's what America gives us, all of us: the capacity to change. It won't happen overnight. The issues we're grappling with go back decades, even centuries. But if we can open our hearts to try and see ourselves in one another, if we can worry less about which side has been wronged and worry more about joining sides to do right, as equal parts of one American family, then I'm confident that together, we will lead our country to a better day.\nThanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-07-16", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

As all of you know now, this morning three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge were killed in the line of duty. Three others were wounded. One is still in critical condition.\nAs of right now, we don't know the motive of the killer. We don't know whether the killer set out to target police officers or whether he gunned them down as they responded to a call. Regardless of motive, the death of these three brave officers underscores the danger that police across the country confront every single day. And we as a nation have to be loud and clear that nothing justifies violence against law enforcement. Attacks on police are an attack on all of us and the rule of law that makes society possible.\nNow, earlier this afternoon I spoke with Governor Edwards and Mayor Holden, and I offered them the full support of the Federal Government and reiterated my full support for law enforcement in Baton Rouge and for police officers across the country. I also spoke to the Attorney General, and the FBI has already been on the scene. And through the work of all levels of government, justice will be done.\nMost of all, our hearts go out to the families who are grieving. Our prayers go out to the officer who is still fighting for his life. This has happened far too often. And I've spent a lot of time with law enforcement this past week. I'm surrounded by the best of the best every single day. And I know whenever this happens, wherever this happens, you feel it. Your families feel it. But what I want you to know today is the respect and the gratitude of the American people for everything that you do for us.\nAnd 5 days ago, I traveled to Dallas for the memorial service of the officers who were slain there. I said that that killer would not be the last person who tries to make us turn on each other. Nor will today's killer. It remains up to us to make sure that they fail. That decision is all of ours: the decision to make sure that our best selves are reflected across America, not our worst—that's up to us.\nWe have our divisions, and they are not new. Around-the-clock news cycles and social media sometimes amplify these divisions, and I know we're about to enter a couple of weeks of conventions where our political rhetoric tends to be more overheated than usual.\nAnd that is why it is so important that everyone—regardless of race or political party or profession, regardless of what organizations you are a part of—everyone right now focus on words and actions that can unite this country rather than divide it further. We don't need inflammatory rhetoric. We don't need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda. We need to temper our words and open our hearts, all of us. We need what we saw in Dallas this week, as a community came together to restore order and deepen unity and understanding. We need the kind of efforts we saw this week in meetings between community leaders and police—some of which I participated in—where I saw people of good will pledge to work together to reduce violence throughout all of our communities. That's what's needed right now. And it is up to all of us to make sure we are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Someone once wrote, \"A bullet need happen only once, but for peace to work, we need to be reminded of its existence again and again and again.\"\nMy fellow Americans, only we can prove, through words and through deeds, that we will not be divided. And we're going to have to keep on doing it \"again and again and again.\" That's how this country gets united. That's how we bring people of good will together. Only we can prove that we have the grace and the character and the common humanity to end this kind of senseless violence, to reduce fear and mistrust within the American family, to set an example for our children.\nAnd that's who we are, and that's who we always have the capacity to be. And that's the best way for us to honor the sacrifice of the brave police officers who were taken from us this morning.\nMay God bless them and their families, and may God bless the United States of America.

We will make America safe. We seek friendship with all peoples and all nations, but we recognize and are prepared to deal with evil in the world.\nBased on these principles, this platform is an invitation and a roadmap. It invites every American to join us and shows the path to a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America.\nThis platform is optimistic because the American people are optimistic.\nThis platform lays out — in clear language — the path to making America great and united again.\nFor the past 8 years America has been led in the wrong direction.\nOur economy has become unnecessarily weak with stagnant wages. People living paycheck to paycheck are struggling, sacrificing, and suffering.\nAmericans have earned and deserve a strong and healthy economy.\nOur standing in world affairs has declined significantly — our enemies no longer fear us and our friends no long trust us.\nPeople want and expect an America that is the most powerful and respected country on the face of the earth.\nThe men and women of our military remain the world's best. The have been shortchanged in numbers, equipment, and benefits by a Commander in Chief who treats the Armed Forces and our veterans as a necessary inconvenience.\nThe President and the Democratic party have dismantled Americans' system of healthcare. They have replaced it with a costly and complicated scheme that limits choices and takes away our freedom.\nThe President and the Democratic party have abandoned their promise of being accountable to the American people.\nThey have nearly doubled the size of the national debt.\nThey refuse to control our borders but try to control our schools, farms, businesses, and even our religious institutions. They have directly attacked the production of American energy and the industry-related jobs that have sustained families and communities.\nThe President has been regulating to death a free market economy that he does not like and does not understand. He defies the laws of the United States by refusing to enforce those with which he does not agree. And he appoints judges who legislate from the bench rather than apply the law.\nWe, as Republicans and Americans, cannot allow this to continue. That is why the many sections of this platform affirm our trust in the people, our faith in their judgment, and our determination to help them take back their country.\nThis means removing the power from unelected, unaccountable government.\nThis means relieving the burden and expense of punishing government regulations.\nAnd this means returning to the people and the states the control that belongs to them. It is the control and the power to make their own decisions about what's best for themselves and their families and communities.\nThis platform is many things: A handbook for returning decision-making to the people. A guide to the constitutional rights of every American. And a manual for the kind of sustained growth that will bring opportunity to all those on the sidelines of our society.\nEvery time we sing, \"God Bless America,\" we are asking for help. We ask for divine help that our country can fulfill its promise. We earn that help by recommitting ourselves to the ideas and ideals that are the true greatness of America.\nSenator John Barrasso, CHAIRMAN\nGovernor Mary Fallin, CO-CHAIR\nRepresentative Virginia Foxx, CO-CHAIR\nTable of Contents\n1\nRestoring the American Dream\n9\nA Rebirth of Constitutional Government\n17\nAmerica's Natural Resources: Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment\n23\nGovernment Reform\n31\nGreat American Families, Education, Healthcare, and Criminal Justice\n41\nAmerica Resurgent\nRestoring the American Dream\nRebuilding the Economy and Creating Jobs\nWe are the party of a growing economy that gives everyone a chance in life, an opportunity to learn, work, and realize the prosperity freedom makes possible.\nGovernment cannot create prosperity, though government can limit or destroy it. Prosperity is the product of self-discipline, enterprise, saving and investment by individuals, but it is not an end in itself. Prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government, raise their children by their own values, practice their faith, and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect. It is also the foundation for our nation's global leadership, for it is the vigor of our economy which makes possible our military strength and our national security.\nPundits and Democrats tell us that we should accept the new normal of a slow-growing economy. The consequences are too dire to ever accept that: President Obama and his party will set a record of being the first modern president ever to leave office without a single calendar year of three percent economic growth. As a result, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased by 7 million, our nation's economy has lost nearly $8 trillion of cumulative output compared with an average recovery, and the economic growth shortfall has left a cumulative real after-tax per person personal income shortfall of nearly $17,000 compared with an average recovery.\nUnder President Obama and the Democrats, new private-sector jobs are three million below where they should have been with just average modern post-recession growth. Our labor force participation rate has plunged to at or below 63 percent for far too long, lows last seen two generations ago before President Reagan was elected in 1980. Business closures have exceeded business startups throughout the Obama Presidency. Strong growth, more jobs, increasing incomes, and expanding opportunity are all in short supply under President Obama and the Democrats.\nWe repudiate the absurd idea this is the best America can do. The American people rejected that nonsense the last time it was offered, in the historic election of 1980, and we ask them to join us now to again repudiate the false gospel of America's diminishment and retreat. We offer instead our vision of an opportunity society based on the economics of inclusion.\nFair and Simple Taxes for Growth\nRepublicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative. More than any other public policy, the way government raises revenue — how much, at what rates, under what circumstances, from whom, and for whom — has the greatest impact on our economy's performance. It powerfully influences the level of economic growth and job creation, which translates into the level of opportunity for those who would otherwise be left behind. Getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity.\nThe current tax code is rightly the object of both anger and mockery. Its length is exceeded only by its complexity. We must start anew. That will be an enormous undertaking and, if it is to succeed, it must command the attention and approval of the American people. It cannot be engineered from the top down, but must have a common sense approach, and be simplified.\nOur proposal is straightforward. Wherever tax rates penalize thrift or discourage investment, they must be lowered. Wherever current provisions of the code are disincentives for economic growth, they must be changed. We will not divide the American people into winners and losers. We will eliminate as many special interest provisions and loopholes as possible and curb corporate welfare, especially where their erosion of the tax base has created pressure for higher rates. We will be mindful of the burdens on families with children and the impact on an aging population. We will seek simplicity and clarity so that every taxpayer can understand how much of their income is consumed by the federal government.\nWe will welcome all to this enterprise — to discuss, debate, challenge, and amend — so that together we can restore economic growth for the American people and, even more important, renew their faith in the future.\nOur Tax Principles\nTo ensure that past abuses will not be repeated, we assert these fundamental principles. We oppose retroactive taxation. We condemn attempts by activist judges at any level of government to seize the power of the purse from the people's elected representatives by ordering higher taxes.\nWe oppose tax policies that deliberately divide Americans or promote class warfare. Because of the vital role of religious organizations, charities, and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering generosity and patriotism, they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should remain deductible. To guard against hypertaxation of the American people in any restructuring of the federal tax system, any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, which established the federal income tax.\nA Competitive America\nCompetitiveness equals jobs. That equation governs our policies regarding U.S. corporations in the global economy. Private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation. After falling dramatically during the recession, private investment has recovered at a disappointing pace due in part to high corporate tax rates and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty.\nAmerican businesses now face the world's highest corporate tax rates. That's like putting lead shoes on your cross-country team. It reduces companies' ability to compete overseas, encourages them to move abroad, lessens their investment, cripples job creation here at home, lowers American wages, and fosters the avoidance of tax liability — without actually increasing tax revenues. A more damaging policy is hard to imagine. We propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with, or below, the rates of other industrial nations. We endorse the recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as the current Administration's Export Council, to switch to a territorial system of taxation so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for job-creating investment here at home. We believe American companies should be headquartered in America. We should reduce barriers to accomplishing that goal.\nA Winning Trade Policy\nInternational trade is crucial for all sectors of America's economy. Massive trade deficits are not. We envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets, what has been called a \"Reagan Economic Zone,\" in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned.\nWe need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first. When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports. When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. interests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected.\nWe cannot allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology. We cannot allow China to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of U.S. products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports. The current Administration's way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender.\nRepublicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it. A Republican president will insist on parity in trade and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate.\nAt the same time, we look to broaden our trade agreements with countries which share our values and commitment to fairness, along with transparency in our commercial and business practices. In pursuing that objective, the American people demand transparency, full disclosure, protection of our national sovereignty, and tough negotiation on the part of those who are supposed to advance the interests of U.S. workers. Significant trade agreements should not be rushed or undertaken in a Lame Duck Congress.\nFreeing Financial Markets\nThe Republican vision for American banking calls for establishing transparent, efficient markets where consumers can obtain loans they need at reasonable rates based on market conditions. Unfortunately, in response to the financial institutions crisis of 2008-2009, the Democratic-controlled Congress enacted the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, otherwise known as Dodd-Frank. They did not let the crisis go to waste but used it as an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nation's financial markets. The consequences have been bad for everyone except federal regulators.\nRather than address the cause of the crisis — the government's own housing policies — the new law extended government control over the economy by creating new unaccountable bureaucracies. Predictably, central planning of our financial sector has not created jobs, it has killed them. It has not limited risks, it has created more. It has not encouraged economic growth, it has shackled it.\nSince the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the number of community banks has significantly declined, and the cost and complexity of complying with the law has created impediments to the remaining banks' ability to support the customers they serve. From 13,000 community banks in 1985, only 1,900 remain. Still, the majority of agricultural loans and small business loans are made by community banks. From start-ups foregone to home loans not made, Dodd-Frank's excessive regulation and burdensome requirements have helped contribute to the slow economy we all endure today under President Obama and the Democrats.\nCommunity banks are essential to ensuring small businesses have easy and affordable access to the capital they need to grow and prosper. Community banks should be relieved of excessive regulations. We support removing roadblocks and regulations that prevent access to capital.\nThe worst of Dodd-Frank is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, deliberately designed to be a rogue agency. It answers to neither Congress nor the executive, has its own guaranteed funding outside the appropriations process, and uses its slush fund to steer settlements to politically favored groups.\nIts Director has dictatorial powers unique in the American Republic. Its regulatory harassment of local and regional banks, the source of most home mortgages and small business loans, advantages big banks and makes it harder for Americans to buy a home. Its one-size-fits-all approach to every issue threatens the diversity of the country's financial system and would leave us with just a few enormous institutions, as in many European countries.\nIf the Bureau is not abolished, it should be subjected to congressional appropriation. In that way, consumer protection in the financial markets can be advanced through measures that are both effective and constitutional. Any settlements arising from statutory violations by financial institutions must be used to make whole the harmed consumers, with any remaining proceeds given to the general Treasury. Diversion of settlement funds to politically-connected parties should be a criminal offense.\nRepublicans believe that no financial institution is too big to fail. We support legislation to ensure that the problems of any financial institution can be resolved through the Bankruptcy Code. We endorse prudent regulation of the banking system to ensure that FDIC-regulated banks are properly capitalized and taxpayers are protected against bailouts. We will end the government's use of disparate impact theory in enforcing anti-discrimination laws with regard to lending.\nResponsible Homeownership and Rental Opportunities\nHomeownership expands personal liberty, builds communities, and helps Americans create wealth. \"The American Dream\" is not a stale slogan. It is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people. It means a decent place to live, a safe place to raise kids, a welcoming place to retire. It bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family and, in the process, create caring neighborhoods.\nThe Great Recession devastated the housing market. U.S. taxpayers paid billions to rescue Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the latter managed and controlled by senior officials from the Carter and Clinton Administrations, and to cover the losses of the poorly-managed Federal Housing Administration. Millions lost their homes, millions more lost value in their homes.\nMore than six million households had to move from homeownership to renting. Rental costs escalated so that today nearly 12 million families spend more than 50 percent of their incomes just on rent. The national homeownership rate has sharply fallen and the rate for minority households and young adults has plummeted. So many remain unemployed or underemployed, and for the lucky ones with jobs, rising rents make it harder to save for a mortgage.\nThere is a growing sense that our national standard of living will never be as high as it was in the past. We understand that pessimism but do not share it, for we believe that sound public policies can restore growth to our economy, vigor to the housing market, and hope to those who are now on the margins of prosperity.\nOur goal is to advance responsible home-ownership while guarding against the abuses that led to the housing collapse. We must scale back the federal role in the housing market, promote responsibility on the part of borrowers and lenders, and avoid future taxpayer bailouts. Reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on predatory lending and acceptable lending practices. Compliance with regulatory standards should constitute a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation by trial lawyers.\nWe call for a comprehensive review of federal regulations, especially those dealing with the environment, that make it harder and more costly for Americans to rent, buy, or sell homes.\nFor nine years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship and the current Administration and Democrats have prevented any effort to reform them. Their corrupt business model lets shareholders and executives reap huge profits while the taxpayers cover all loses. The utility of both agencies should be reconsidered as a Republican administration clears away the jumble of subsidies and controls that complicate and distort home-buying.\nThe Federal Housing Administration, which provides taxpayer-backed guarantees in the mortgage market, should no longer support high-income individuals, and the public should not be financially exposed by risks taken by FHA officials. We will end the government mandates that required Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and federally-insured banks to satisfy lending quotas to specific groups. Discrimination should have no place in the mortgage industry.\nZoning decisions have always been, and must remain, under local control. The current Administration is trying to seize control of the zoning process through its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation. It threatens to undermine zoning laws in order to socially engineer every community in the country. While the federal government has a legitimate role in enforcing non-discrimination laws, this regulation has nothing to do with proven or alleged discrimination and everything to do with hostility to the self-government of citizens.\nAmerica on the Move\nOur country's investments in transportation and other public construction have traditionally been non-partisan. Everyone agrees on the need for clean water and safe roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports. President Eisenhower established a tradition of Republican leadership in this regard by championing the creation of the interstate highway system. In recent years, bipartisan cooperation led to major legislation improving the nation's ports and waterways.\nOur Republican majority ended the practice of earmarks, which often diverted transportation spending to politically favored projects. In the current Congress, Republicans have secured the longest reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund in a decade and are advancing a comprehensive reform of the Federal Aviation Administration to make flying easier and more secure.\nThe current Administration has a different approach. It subordinates civil engineering to social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit. Its ill-named Livability Initiative is meant to \"coerce people out of their cars.\" This is the same mentality that once led Congress to impose by fiat a single maximum speed limit for the entire nation, from Manhattan to Montana. Our 1980 Republican Platform pledged to repeal that edict. After the election of Ronald Reagan, we did.\nNow we make the same pledge regarding the current problems in transportation policy. We propose to remove from the Highway Trust Fund programs that should not be the business of the federal government.\nMore than a quarter of the Fund's spending is diverted from its original purpose. One fifth of its funds are spent on mass transit, an inherently local affair that serves only a small portion of the population, concentrated in six big cities. Additional funds are used for bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping, and historical renovations. Other beneficiaries of highway money are ferry boats, the federal lands access program, scenic byways, and education initiatives. These worthwhile enterprises should be funded through other sources.\nWe propose to phase out the federal transit program and reform provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act which can delay and drive up costs for transportation projects. We renew our call for repeal of the Davis-Bacon law, which limits employment and drives up construction and maintenance costs for the benefit of unions. Recognizing that, over time, additional revenue will be needed to expand the carrying capacity of roads and bridges, we will remove legal roadblocks to public-private partnership agreements that can save the taxpayers' money and bring outside investment to meet a community's needs. With most of the states increasing their own funding for transportation, we oppose a further increase in the federal gas tax.\nAlthough unionization has never been permitted in any government agency concerned with national security, the current Administration has reversed that policy for the Transportation Security Administration. We will correct that mistake. Americans understand that, with the threat of terrorism, their travel may encounter delays, but unacceptably long lines at security checks can have the same impact as a collapsed bridge or washed out highway. TSA employees should always be seen as guardians of the public's safety, not as just another part of the federal workforce.\nAmtrak is an extremely expensive railroad for the American taxpayers, who must subsidize every ticket. The federal government should allow private ventures to provide passenger service in the northeast corridor. The same holds true with regard to high-speed and intercity rail across the country. We reaffirm our intention to end federal support for boondoggles like California's high-speed train to nowhere.\nBuilding the Future: Technology\nThe digital revolution has transformed how we work, learn, sell, shop, socialize — in short, how we live. Technological change drives our positions with regard to STEM education, business and corporate involvement with educational certifications, workforce issues, privacy, cyber and national security, energy development, regulation, and other elements of our campaign for growth and jobs. It is why we propose to simplify the tax code, reduce corporate rates, transition to a territorial system, and create incentives for investment and innovation.\nWe envision government at all levels as a partner with individuals and industries in technological progress, not a meddlesome monitor. We want to create a business climate that rewards risk and promotes innovation, a learning system that gives Americans the skills needed to seize the opportunities of the 21st century, and an international order that maintains a fair and open global market for America's goods and services. We intend to advance policies that protect data privacy while fostering innovation and growth and ensuring the free flow of data across borders.\nTogether, broadband and good ideas have become the 21st century engines of American ingenuity. Innovation, by its nature, is disruptive. In challenging legacy forms of business, innovation creates new jobs, gives access to new markets, opens opportunity to underserved populations, and expands consumer choice. Government must give America's innovators the freedom to create and, on their merits, succeed or fail.\nOur agenda includes balanced protections for intellectual property, explained elsewhere in this document. We intend to facilitate access to spectrum by paving the way for high-speed, next-generation broadband deployment and competition on the internet and for internet services. We want government to encourage the sharing economy and on-demand platforms to compete in an open market, and we believe public policies should encourage the innovation and competition that are essential for an Internet of Things to thrive.\nGovernment must keep pace with the technology deployed in the private sector. There is an urgent need to modernize the federal government's legacy systems and to recruit the skilled technical personnel who can advance the adoption of innovation in the public sector. At the cost of billions, the current Administration has done little to advance our goal of universal broadband coverage. That hurts rural America, where farmers, ranchers, and small business people need connectivity to operate in real time with the world's producers. Almost ten million Americans have given up wired broadband connections in just the last two years alone, and millions more have never been connected in the first place.\nWe encourage public-private partnerships to provide predictable support for connecting rural areas so that every American can fully participate in the global economy.\nThe public-private partnerships between NASA, the Department of Defense, and commercial companies have given us technological progress that has reduced the cost of accessing space and extended America's space leadership in the commercial, civil, and national security spheres. The entrepreneurship and innovation culture of the free market is revitalizing the nation's space capabilities, saving taxpayer money, and advancing technology critical to maintain America's edge in space and in other fields.\nTo protect our national security interests and foster innovation and competitiveness, we must sustain our preeminence in space by launching more scientific missions, guaranteeing unfettered access, and ensuring that our space-related industries remain a source of scientific leadership and education.\nBuilding the Future: America's Electric Grid\nOur nation's interstate electric transmission system has long been a catalyst for developing and delivering low cost energy while spurring economic growth throughout the United States The grid is aging, vulnerable to cyber and terrorist threats, and unprepared to serve our energy needs of tomorrow. It should not take seven to ten years to plan and construct a transmission line. We support expedited siting processes and the thoughtful expansion of the grid so that consumers and businesses continue to have access to affordable and reliable electricity.\nStart-up Century: Small Business and Entrepreneurship\nA central reason why the 20th century came to be called the American Century was the ability of individuals to invent and create in a land of free markets. Back then they were called risk-takers, dreamers, and small business owners. Today they are the entrepreneurs, independent contractors, and small business men and women of our new economy. Their innovation drives improvement and forces long-established institutions to adapt or fade away. Many of them are so young they remember little if anything of the last century because dynamic progress does not look back. As in the past, they still create most new jobs and form the commercial network that holds communities together. Their enterprise is the lifeblood of our economy, but it is weakening.\nMore businesses are closing in our country than are starting. Older firms are an increasing proportion of companies. Productivity growth has slowed. This is not the way to jumpstart a new era of growth. We need to consider the effect of capital gains rates on the availability of venture capital, as well as the positive impact of expensing on start-up firms.\nWe should reduce the occupational licensing laws that shut untold millions of potential workers out of entrepreneurial careers. We must overturn the regulatory nightmare, created by the Dodd-Frank law, for the community banks and savings and loans that provide nearly half of all small-business loans and over three-quarters of all agricultural loans. Indeed, the world of the app economy cries out for the comprehensive regulatory reform proposed elsewhere in this platform. We must challenge established interests and traditional business patterns to facilitate market entry of new business models, including inventive means of transport, delivery, and communication.\nAs incubators of unconventional thinking, our country's existing research infrastructure — the National Labs, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and elements of the Defense Department — have the potential to form partnerships with small businesses to create an American Start-Up Century.\nThe Federal Reserve\nBecause the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions affect job creation, upward mobility for workers, and equitable prosperity, they should be transparent. Similarly, the Federal Reserve's important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner. The Republican Party will advance legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, and the Federal Reserve's dealing with foreign banks.\nThe first step is through an annual audit of the Federal Reserve's activities. Such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the Federal Reserve remains insulated from political pressures and its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than political pressures for easy money and loose credit.\nDetermined to crush the double-digit inflation that was part of the Carter Administration's economic legacy, President Reagan, shortly after his inauguration, established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for U.S. currency. In 2012, facing the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current Administration's policies, we proposed a similar commission to investigate ways to set a fixed value for the dollar.\nWith Republican leadership, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to set up just such a commission. We recommend its enactment by the full Congress and the commission's careful consideration of ways to secure the integrity of our currency.\nWorkplace Freedom for a 21st Century Workforce\nThe greatest asset of the American economy is the hard-working American. That is why our first priority is getting people back to work by fostering the kind of growth that creates jobs. That overarching goal unites all the sections of this platform. It runs through our commitments on education and workforce development. It underlies our approach to welfare reform, regulatory reform, and our determination to advance the kind of trade agreements that multiply opportunities for workers here at home. It also impels us to challenge the anachronistic labor laws that limit workers' freedom and lock them into the workplace rules of their great-grandfathers.\nInstead of facilitating change, the current Administration and its agents at the National Labor Relations Board are determined to reverse it. They are attacking the franchise model of business development, which is essential to the flexibility and creativity of the new economy. They are wielding provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act from the 1930s, designed to fit a manufacturing workplace, to deny flexibility to both employers and employees. They have repealed union transparency rules that allowed members to discover what was being done with their dues. They have outlawed alternatives to unions even when they were favored by the workers.\nTheir Project Labor Agreements discriminate against the overwhelming majority of workers by barring them from jobs on taxpayer-funded projects. Their patronizing and controlling approach leaves workers in a form of peonage to the NLRB. We intend to restore fairness and common sense to that agency.\nTechnology has already created jobs that did not exist fifteen years ago, and today's workers need flexibility and family-friendly options to make the most of them, especially portability in pension plans and health insurance.\nWe intend to encourage those trends by bringing labor law into the 21st century. It should encourage cooperation between management and workers, not conflict. All workers, including union members, must be free to accept raises and rewards without veto power from union officials. All unionized workers should be able to find out what is going on in their union trust funds and in their executive compensation. We support the right of states to enact Right-to-Work laws and call for a national law to protect the economic liberty of the modern workforce.\nAll Americans deserve the opportunity to pursue their American dream free from discrimination. Clear nondiscrimination policies ensure all employees have the chance to succeed based solely on their merits. These policies are vital to creating an inclusive, innovative, and competitive workforce.\nRepublicans believe that the employer-employee relationship of the future will be built upon employee empowerment and workplace flexibility. We therefore endorse employee stock ownership plans that enable workers to become capitalists, expand the realm of private property, and energize a free enterprise economy.\nMinimum wage is an issue that should be handled at the state and local level.\nA Federal Workforce Serving the People\nThe federal workforce is larger and more highly paid than ever. The taxpayers spend an average of $35,000 a year per employee on non-cash benefits, triple the average non-cash compensation of the average worker in the private sector. Federal employees receive extraordinary pension benefits and vacation time wildly out of line with those of the private sector.\nWe urge Congress to bring federal compensation and benefits in line with the standards of most American employees. A Republican administration should streamline personnel procedures to expedite the firing of bad workers, tax cheats, and scammers. The unionization of the federal workforce, first permitted by Democrat presidents in the 1960s, should be reviewed by the appropriate congressional committees to examine its effects on the cost, quality, and performance of the civil service. Union representatives in the federal workforce should not be paid to conduct union business on the public's time.\nReducing the Federal Debt\nOur national debt is a burden on our economy and families. The huge increase in the national debt demanded by and incurred during the current Administration has placed a significant burden on future generations. We must impose firm caps on future debt, accelerate the repayment of the trillions we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of responsible and limited government, and remove the burdens we are placing on future generations.\nA strong economy is one key to debt reduction, but spending restraint is a necessary component that must be vigorously pursued.\nA Rebirth of Constitutional Government\nWe the People\nWe are the party of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The Declaration sets forth the fundamental precepts of American government: That God bestows certain inalienable rights on every individual, thus producing human equality; that government exists first and foremost to protect those inalienable rights; that man-made law must be consistent with God-given, natural rights; and that if God-given, natural, inalienable rights come in conflict with government, court, or human-granted rights, God-given, natural, inalienable rights always prevail; that there is a moral law recognized as \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\"; and that American government is to operate with the consent of the governed. We are also the party of the Constitution, the greatest political document ever written. It is the solemn compact built upon principles of the Declaration that enshrines our God-given individual rights and ensures that all Americans stand equal before the law, defines the purposes and limits of government, and is the blueprint for ordered liberty that makes the United States the world's freest and most prosperous nation.\nWe reaffirm the Constitution's fundamental principles: limited government, separation of powers, individual liberty, and the rule of law. We denounce bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic prejudice, and religious intolerance. Therefore, we oppose discrimination based on race, sex, religion, creed, disability, or national origin and support statutes to end such discrimination. As the Party of Abraham Lincoln, we must continue to foster solutions to America's difficult challenges when it comes to race relations today. We continue to encourage equality for all citizens and access to the American Dream. Merit and hard work should determine advancement in our society, so we reject unfair preferences, quotas, and set-asides as forms of discrimination. Our ranks include Americans from every faith and tradition, and we respect the right of each American to follow his or her deeply held beliefs.\nOur Constitution is in crisis. More than 90 percent of federal requirements are now imposed by regulatory agencies, without any vote of the House or Senate or signature of the President. The current Administration has exceeded its constitutional authority, brazenly and flagrantly violated the separation of powers, sought to divide America into groups and turn citizen against citizen. The President has refused to defend or enforce laws he does not like, used executive orders to enact national policies in areas constitutionally reserved solely to Congress, made unconstitutional \"recess\" appointments to Senate-confirmed positions, directed regulatory agencies to overstep their statutory authority, and failed to consult Congress regarding military action overseas. He has changed what John Adams called \"a government of laws and not of men\" into just the opposite.\nDemocrats in Congress have enabled, supported, and defended each of these breaches. They have applauded the President's efforts to do an end-run around Congress and stymied Republican efforts to restrain executive lawlessness. Democrats in Congress have also endorsed an anti-constitutional agenda of their own. Forty-eight Democratic senators, for instance, voted to amend the Bill of Rights to give government officials control over political speech. Democrats in Congress have likewise proposed bills that would limit religious liberty, undermine property rights, and eviscerate the Second Amendment.\nIn a free society, the primary role of government is to protect the God-given, inalienable rights of its citizens. These constitutional rights are not negotiable for any American. We affirm that all legislation, regulation, and official actions must conform to the Constitution's original meaning as understood at the time the language was adopted.\nOur most urgent task as a Party is to restore the American people's faith in their government by electing a president who will enforce duly enacted laws, honor constitutional limits on executive authority, and return credibility to the Oval Office. We need a Republican president who will end abuses of power by departments and agencies, like the IRS and the EPA, and by the White House itself. Safeguarding our liberties requires a president who will respect the Constitution's separation of powers, including the authority of Congress to write legislation and define agency authority. Americans also deserve a president who will speak for our nation's history and values, not apologize for them to our enemies.\nThe Judiciary\nThe rule of law is the foundation of our Republic. A critical threat to our country's constitutional order is an activist judiciary that usurps powers properly reserved to the people through other branches of government. Only a Republican president will appoint judges who respect the rule of law expressed within the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including the inalienable right to life and the laws of nature and nature's God, as did the late Justice Antonin Scalia. We are facing a national crisis in our judiciary. We understand that only by electing a Republican president in 2016 will America have the opportunity for up to five new constitutionally-minded Supreme Court justices appointed to fill vacancies on the Court. Only such appointments will enable courts to begin to reverse the long line of activist decisions — including Roe, Obergefell, and the Obamacare cases — that have usurped Congress's and states' lawmaking authority, undermined constitutional protections, expanded the power of the judiciary at the expense of the people and their elected representatives, and stripped the people of their power to govern themselves. We believe in the constitutional checks and balances and that the Founders intended the judiciary to be the weakest branch. We encourage Congress to use the check of impeachment for judges who unconstitutionally usurp Article I powers. In tandem with a Republican Senate, a new Republican president will restore to the Court a strong conservative majority that will follow the text and original meaning of the Constitution and our laws.\nThe legitimate powers of government are rooted in the consent of the American people. Judicial activism that includes reliance on foreign law or unratified treaties undermines American sovereignty. Foreign laws and precedents should not be used to interpret our Constitution or laws, nor should foreign sources of law be used in state courts' adjudication of criminal or civil matters.\nWe also affirm the wisdom of President George Washington's warning to avoid foreign entanglements and unnecessary alliances. We therefore oppose the adoption or ratification of treaties that would weaken or encroach upon American sovereignty or that could be construed by courts to do so. We will not recognize as binding upon the United States any international agree-ment forged without the constitutionally required assent of two-thirds of the United States Senate.\nAdministrative Law\nArticle I of the Constitution directs that \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States….\" For more than a century, however, Congress has delegated increasing amounts of legislative authority to executive departments, agencies, and commissions, laying the foundation for today's vast administrative state. Unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch now write countless rules with the force of law and arbitrarily punish individuals who disobey those rules. The Constitution makes clear that these powers were granted to Congress by the people and must therefore remain solely with the people's elected representatives. We call on Congress to begin reclaiming its constitutional powers from the bureaucratic state by requiring that major new federal regulations be approved by Congress before they can take effect, such as through the Regulation Freedom Amendment. We further affirm that courts should interpret laws as written by Congress rather than allowing executive agencies to rewrite those laws to suit administration priorities.\nDefending Marriage Against an Activist Judiciary\nTraditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values. We condemn the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Windsor, which wrongly removed the ability of Congress to define marriage policy in federal law. We also condemn the Supreme Court's lawless ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which in the words of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, was a \"judicial Putsch\" — full of \"silly extravagances\" — that reduced \"the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Storey to the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie.\" In Obergefell, five unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The Court twisted the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment beyond recognition. To echo Scalia, we dissent. We, therefore, support the appointment of justices and judges who respect the constitutional limits on their power and respect the authority of the states to decide such fundamental social questions.\nThe First Amendment: Religious Liberty\nThe Bill of Rights lists religious liberty, with its rights of conscience, as the first freedom to be protected. Religious freedom in the Bill of Rights protects the right of the people to practice their faith in their everyday lives. As George Washington taught, \"religion and morality are indispensable supports\" to a free society. Similarly, Thomas Jefferson declared that \"No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.\" Ongoing attempts to compel individuals, businesses, and institutions of faith to transgress their beliefs are part of a misguided effort to undermine religion and drive it from the public square. As a result, many charitable religious institutions that have demonstrated great success in helping the needy have been barred from receiving government grants and contracts. Government officials threaten religious colleges and universities with massive fines and seek to control their personnel decisions. Places of worship for the first time in our history have reason to fear the loss of tax-exempt status merely for espousing and practicing traditional religious beliefs that have been held across the world for thousands of years, and for almost four centuries in America. We value the right of America's religious leaders to preach, and Americans to speak freely, according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specifically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs, and therefore we urge the repeal of the Johnson Amendment.\nWe pledge to defend the religious beliefs and rights of conscience of all Americans and to safeguard religious institutions against government control. We endorse the First Amendment Defense Act, Republican legislation in the House and Senate which will bar government discrimination against individuals and businesses for acting on the belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. This Act would protect the non-profit tax status of faith-based adoption agencies, the accreditation of religious educational institutions, the grants and contracts of faith-based charities and small businesses, and the licensing of religious professions — all of which are under assault by elements of the Democratic Party. We encourage every state to pass similar legislation. We likewise endorse the efforts of Republican state legislators and governors who have defied intimidation from corporations and the media in defending religious liberty. We support laws to confirm the longstanding American tradition that religious individuals and institutions can educate young people, receive government benefits, and participate in public debates without having to check their religious beliefs at the door.\nOur First Amendment rights are not given to us by the government but are rights we inherently possess. The government cannot use subsequent amendments to limit First Amendment rights. The Free Exercise Clause is both an individual and a collective liberty protecting a right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. Therefore, we strongly support the freedom of Americans to act in accordance with their religious beliefs, not only in their houses of worship, but also in their everyday lives.\nWe support the right of the people to conduct their businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs and condemn public officials who have proposed boycotts against businesses that support traditional marriage. We pledge to protect those business owners who have been subjected to hate campaigns, threats of violence, and other attempts to deny their civil rights.\nWe support the public display of the Ten Commandments as a reflection of our history and our country's Judeo-Christian heritage and further affirm the rights of religious students to engage in voluntary prayer at public school events and to have equal access to school facilities. We assert the First Amendment right of freedom of association for religious, private, service, and youth organizations to set their own membership standards.\nThe First Amendment: Constitutionally Protected Speech\nThe rights of citizenship do not stop at the ballot box. Freedom of speech includes the right to devote resources to whatever cause or candidate one supports. We oppose any restrictions or conditions that would discourage citizens from participating in the public square or limit their ability to promote their ideas, such as requiring private organizations to publicly disclose their donors to the government. Limits on political speech serve only to protect the powerful and insulate incumbent officeholders. We support repeal of federal restrictions on political parties in McCain-Feingold, raising or repealing contribution limits, protecting the political speech of advocacy groups, corporations, and labor unions, and protecting political speech on the internet. We likewise call for an end to the so-called Fairness Doctrine, and support free-market approaches to free speech unregulated by government.\nWe believe the forced funding of political candidates through union dues and other mandatory contributions violates the First Amendment. Just as Americans have a First Amendment right to devote resources to favored candidates or views, they have a First Amendment right not to be forced to individually support individuals or ideologies that they oppose. We agree with Thomas Jefferson that \"To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\"\nThe Second Amendment: Our Right to Keep and Bear Arms\nWe uphold the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, a natural inalienable right that predates the Constitution and is secured by the Second Amendment. Lawful gun ownership enables Americans to exercise their God-given right of self-defense for the safety of their homes, their loved ones, and their communities.\nWe salute the Republican Congress for defending the right to keep and bear arms by preventing the President from installing a new liberal majority on the Supreme Court. The confirmation to the Court of additional anti-gun justices would eviscerate the Second Amendment's fundamental protections. Already, local officials in the nation's capital and elsewhere are defying the Court's decisions upholding an individual right to bear arms as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald. We support firearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of law-abiding Americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all 50 states. We support constitutional carry statutes and salute the states that have passed them. We oppose ill-conceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle. We also oppose any effort to deprive individuals of their right to keep and bear arms without due process of law.\nWe condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers and the current Administration's illegal harassment of firearm dealers. We oppose federal licensing or registration of law-abiding gun owners, registration of ammunition, and restoration of the ill-fated Clinton gun ban. We call for a thorough investigation — by a new Republican administration — of the deadly \"Fast and Furious\" operation perpetrated by Department of Justice officials who approved and allowed illegal sales of guns to known violent criminals.\nThe Fourth Amendment: Liberty and Privacy\nAffirming the Fourth Amendment \"right of the people to be secure in their houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\" we call for strict limitations on the use of aerial surveillance on U.S. soil, with the exception of patrolling our national borders for illegal entry and activity. We oppose any attempts by government to require surveillance devices in our daily lives, including tracking devices in motor vehicles.\nIn recent years, technology companies have responded to market demand for products and services that protect the privacy of customers through increasingly sophisticated encryption technology. These increased privacy protections have become crucial to the digital economy. At the same time, however, such innovations have brought new dangers, especially from criminals and terrorists who seek to use encryption technology to harm us. No matter the medium, citizens must retain the right to communicate with one another free from unlawful government intrusion. It will not be easy to balance privacy rights with the government's legitimate need to access encrypted information. This issue is too important to be left to the courts. A Republican president and a Republican Congress must listen to the American people and forge a consensus solution.\nThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Foreign Bank and Asset Reporting Requirements result in government's warrantless seizure of personal financial information without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Americans overseas should enjoy the same rights as Americans residing in the United States, whose private financial information is not subject to disclosure to the government except as to interest earned. The requirement for all banks around the world to provide detailed information to the IRS about American account holders outside the United States has resulted in banks refusing service to them. Thus, FATCA not only allows \"unreasonable search and seizures\" but also threatens the ability of overseas Americans to lead normal lives. We call for its repeal and for a change to residency-based taxation for U.S. citizens overseas.\nThe Fifth Amendment: Protecting Human Life\nThe Constitution's guarantee that no one can \"be deprived of life, liberty or property\" deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independence's proclamation that \"all\" are \"endowed by their Creator\" with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\nWe oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like Planned Parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare. We urge all states and Congress to make it a crime to acquire, transfer, or sell fetal tissues from elective abortions for research, and we call on Congress to enact a ban on any sale of fetal body parts. In the meantime, we call on Congress to ban the practice of misleading women on so-called fetal harvesting consent forms, a fact revealed by a 2015 investigation. We will not fund or subsidize healthcare that includes abortion coverage.\nWe support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. We oppose the non-consensual withholding or withdrawal of care or treatment, including food and water, from individuals with disabilities, newborns, the elderly, or the infirm, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide.\nWe affirm our moral obligation to assist, rather than penalize, women who face an unplanned pregnancy. In order to encourage women who face an unplanned pregnancy to choose life, we support legislation that requires financial responsibility for the child be equally borne by both the mother and father upon conception until the child reaches adulthood. Failure to require a father to be equally responsible for a child places an inequitable burden on the mother, creating a financial and social hardship on both mother and child. We celebrate the millions of Americans who open their hearts, homes, and churches to mothers in need and women fleeing abuse. We thank and encourage providers of counseling, medical services, and adoption assistance for empowering women experiencing an unintended pregnancy to choose life. We support funding for ultrasounds and adoption assistance. We salute the many states that now protect women and girls through laws requiring informed consent, parental consent, waiting periods, and clinic regulation. We condemn the Supreme Court's activist decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt striking down commonsense Texas laws providing for basic health and safety standards in abortion clinics.\nWe applaud the U.S. House of Representatives for leading the effort to add enforcement to the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act by passing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which imposes appropriate civil and criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide treatment and care to an infant who survives an abortion, including early induction delivery whether the death of the infant is intended. We strongly oppose infanticide. Over a dozen states have passed Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Acts prohibiting abortion after twenty weeks, the point at which current medical research shows that unborn babies can feel excruciating pain during abortions, and we call on Congress to enact the federal version. Not only is it good legislation, but it enjoys the support of a majority of the American people. We support state and federal efforts against the cruelest forms of abortion, especially dismemberment abortion procedures, in which unborn babies are literally torn apart limb from limb.\nWe call on Congress to ban sex-selection abortions and abortions based on disabilities — discrimination in its most lethal form. We oppose embryonic stem cell research. We oppose federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. We support adult stem cell research and urge the restoration of the national placental stem cell bank created by President George H.W. Bush but abolished by his Democrat successor, President Bill Clinton. We oppose federal funding for harvesting embryos and call for a ban on human cloning.\nThe Democratic Party is extreme on abortion. Democrats' almost limitless support for abortion, and their strident opposition to even the most basic restrictions on abortion, put them dramatically out of step with the American people. Because of their opposition to simple abortion clinic safety procedures, support for taxpayer-funded abortion, and rejection of pregnancy resource centers that provide abortion alternatives, the old Clinton mantra of \"safe, legal, and rare\" has been reduced to just \"legal.\" We are proud to be the party that protects human life and offers real solutions for women.\nThe Fifth Amendment: Protecting Private Property\nThe Framers of our government knew, from history and experience, that when private property is not secure, freedom is at risk. That is why the Fifth Amendment declares that private property may not be \"taken for public use without just compensation.\" The Supreme Court's Kelo decision undermined this safeguard by allowing local governments to seize a person's home or land not only for vital public use, but also for \"public purpose,\" which thus allowed the government to seize it for transfer to private developers or other private entities. We call on any state legislatures that have not already done so to nullify the impact of Kelo within their jurisdiction by legislation or state constitutional amendments declaring that private property may be taken only for true public use, and we join House Republicans in supporting the Private Property Rights Protection Act.\nThe government at every level must always pay just compensation whenever it takes private property to achieve a compelling public use, with the money coming from the budget of the agency performing the taking. This includes the taking of water rights and the taking of property by environmental regulations that destroy or diminish the property's value.\nCivil asset forfeiture was originally intended as a way to cripple organized crime through the seizure of property used in a criminal enterprise. Regrettably, it has become a tool for unscrupulous law enforcement officials, acting without due process, to profit by destroying the livelihood of innocent individuals, many of whom never recover the lawful assets taken from them. When the rights of the innocent can be so easily violated, no one's rights are safe. We call on Congress and state legislatures to enact reforms to protect law-abiding citizens against abusive asset forfeiture tactics.\nThe Fifth Amendment: Intellectual Property Rights\nPrivate property includes not only physical property such as lands and homes, but also intellectual property like books and patents. Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to safeguard intellectual property rights for \"Authors and Inventors.\" By protecting the proprietary rights of creators and innovators, the Constitution promotes the general welfare by providing incentives for investment in all sorts of technology and artistic works. Intellectual property is a driving force in today's global economy of constant innovation. It is the wellspring of American economic growth and job creation. With the rise of the digital economy, it has become even more critical that we protect intellectual property rights and preserve freedom of contract rather than create regulatory barriers to creativity, growth, and innovation.\nProtecting intellectual property is also a national security issue. We must guard against counterfeit parts that can compromise the reliability of our weapons systems and the safety of military personnel. Today, the worst offenses against intellectual property rights come from abroad, especially in China. We call for strong action by Congress and a new Republican president to enforce intellectual property laws against all infringers, whether foreign or domestic.\nThe Ninth Amendment: The People's Retained Rights\nThe Ninth Amendment to the Constitution declares that \"[t]he enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" This provision codifies the principle that our national government derives its power from the governed and that all powers not delegated to the government are retained by the people. We call upon legislators to give full force to this fundamental principle. We welcome to our ranks all citizens who are determined to reclaim the rights of the people that have been ignored or usurped by the federal and intrusive state governments.\nThe Tenth Amendment: Federalism as the Foundation of Personal Liberty\nFederalism is a cornerstone of our constitutional system. Every violation of state sovereignty by federal officials is not merely a transgression of one unit of government against another; it is an assault on the liberties of individual Americans. Hence the promise of the Tenth Amendment: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" The Constitution gives the federal government very few powers, and they are specifically enumerated; the states and the people retain authority over all unenumerated powers. In obedience to that principle, we condemn the current Administration's unconstitutional expansion into areas beyond those specifically enumerated, including bullying of state and local governments in matters ranging from voter identification (ID) laws to immigration, from healthcare programs to land use decisions, and from forced education curricula to school restroom policies. We pledge to restore the proper balance and vertical separation of powers between the federal government and state governments — the governments closest to, and most reflective of, the American people. We encourage states to reinvigorate their traditional role as the laboratories of democracy, propelling the nation forward through local and state innovation.\nBig government undermines federalism through more than 1,100 grants-in-aid programs that consume more than one-sixth of the federal budget for matters that should be the exclusive responsibility of the states. Through these programs, money originating from state taxpayers is returned to the states, usually greatly reduced, with myriad strings attached. These grants turn state and local elected officials into agents of the federal government. The web of conditions and regulations — especially the requirement of matching funds that comes with federal grants — transforms recipients into appendages of the Washington bureaucracy. We call upon Congress to help a Republican president to reduce and ultimately eliminate this system of conditioned grants so that state and local taxpayers can decide for themselves what is best for their own communities.\nHonest Elections and the Electoral College\nWe oppose the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the Electoral College. An unconstitutional effort to impose National Popular Vote would be a grave threat to our federal system and a guarantee of corruption, as every ballot box in every state would offer a chance to steal the presidency. We urge state legislatures that have voted for this proposal to rescind their approval.\nHonest Elections and the Right to Vote\nHonest elections are the foundation of representative government. We pledge to protect the voting rights of every citizen, as well as their rights of conscience when they are harassed or denied a job because of their contributions to a candidate or a cause. We support state efforts to ensure ballot access for the elderly, the handicapped, military personnel, and all legitimate voters. We urge state and local officials to take all appropriate steps to allow voters to cast their ballots in a timely manner. We are concerned, however, that some voting procedures may be open to abuse. For this reason, we support legislation to require proof of citizenship when registering to vote and secure photo ID when voting. We strongly oppose litigation against states exercising their sovereign authority to enact such laws. In addition, to guarantee that everyone's vote is counted, we urge that electronic voting systems have a voter-verified paper audit trail. We urge every state to join the Interstate Voter Registration Cross Check Program to keep voter rolls accurate and to prevent people from voting in more than one state in the same election. To guard against foreign involvement in our elections, we call for vigilance regarding online credit card contributions to candidates and campaigns.\nThe members of our Armed Forces must not be denied the basic rights that they are defending for others. Our troops, wherever stationed, must be allowed to vote in a timely manner. We call upon the entire military chain of command to ensure the voting rights of our citizen soldiers.\nThe Constitution gives Congress authority to conduct the decennial census \"in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.\" In order to preserve the principle of one person, one vote, we urge our elected representatives to ensure that citizenship, rather than mere residency, be made the basis for the apportionment of representatives among the states.\nAmerica's Natural Resources: Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment\nWe are the party of America's growers, producers, farmers, ranchers, foresters, miners, commercial fishermen, and all those who bring from the earth the crops, minerals, energy, and the bounties of our seas that are the lifeblood of our economy. Their labor and ingenuity, their determination in bad times and love of the land at all times, powers our economy, creates millions of jobs, and feeds billions of people around the world. Only a few years ago, a bipartisan consensus in government valued the role of extractive industries and rewarded their enterprise by minimizing its interference with their work. That has radically changed. We look in vain within the Democratic Party for leaders who will speak for the people of agriculture, energy and mineral production.\nAbundant Harvests\nAgricultural production and exports are central to the Republican agenda for jobs, growth, expanded trade, and prosperity. Because our farmers and ranchers care for the land, the United States does not depend on foreign imports for sustenance. Americans spend a smaller percentage of their income on food than any other nation. On average, one American farm produces enough food to feed 155 people. No other nation has been as generous with food aid to the needy. We have good reason to celebrate our domestic security in food.\nWe are the largest agricultural exporter in the world, and our exports are vital for other sectors of our economy. Those exports drive additional economic growth as each dollar of agricultural exports generates another $1.27 in business activity. That is why we remain committed to expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for agriculture. Under a Republican president, America's trade negotiators will insist that our global trading partners adhere to science-based standards with regard to food and health regulations. We will not tolerate the use of bogus science and scare tactics to bar our products from foreign markets, nor will we allow insufficient health and safety standards for products imported for our consumption.\nWe must also ensure that domestic policies do not compromise our global competitiveness through overregulation and undue interference in the marketplace. There is growing recognition that federal dairy policies, crafted during the Great Depression, are increasingly an impediment to the ability of our dairy producers to meet the expected doubling in global demand coming by 2030. We oppose the policies pushed by special interest groups seeking to stop or make more expensive our current system of safe, efficient, and humane production of meat. Congress has repeatedly had to block the current Administration's draconian rules concerning the marketing of poultry and livestock. This regulatory impulse must be curbed, not on a case-by-case basis, but through a fundamental restructuring of the regulatory process. In the meantime, the intrusive and expensive federal mandates on food options and menu labeling should be ended as soon as possible by a Republican Congress. We oppose the mandatory labeling of genetically modified food, which has proven to be safe, healthy, and a literal life-saver for millions in the developing world.\nThe Democratic Administration's sustained support for additional regulation of agriculture has directly resulted in higher costs of production for those who produce the food we eat. This federal regulatory overreach has resulted and will continue to result in higher food prices for Americans. These higher food costs are particularly challenging for those Americans struggling to make ends meet.\nLike the rest of the economy, agriculture has suffered through eight years of the Democrats' regulatory juggernaut, particularly from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). States, not Washington bureaucrats, are best equipped to engage farmers and ranchers to develop sound farm oversight policies. The EPA's Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, issued jointly with the Army Corps of Engineers, is a travesty. It extends the government's jurisdiction over navigable waters into the micro-management of puddles and ditches on farms, ranches, and other privately-held property. Ditches, dry creek beds, stock ponds, prairie potholes, and other non-navigable wet areas are already regulated by the states. WOTUS is now subject to judicial review and must be invalidated, but that will not be sufficient. Unelected bureaucrats must be stopped from furthering the Democratic Party's political agenda through regulatory demands forced upon citizens and businesses beyond that which is required by law. We must never allow federal agencies to seize control of state waters, watersheds, or groundwater. State waters, watersheds, and groundwater must be the purview of the sovereign states.\nFarmers and ranchers are among this country's leading conservationists. Modern farm practices and technologies, supported by programs from the Department of Agriculture, have led to reduced erosion, improved water and air quality, increased wildlife habitat, all the while maintaining improved agricultural yields. This stewardship of the land benefits everyone, and we remain committed to conservation policies based on the preservation, not the restriction, of working lands. For this reason, ranching on public lands must be fostered, developed, and encouraged. This includes providing for an abundant water supply for America's farmers, ranchers, and their communities.\nFarming and ranching remain high-risk endeavors, and they cannot be isolated from market forces. No segment of agriculture can expect treatment so favorable that it seriously disadvantages workers in other trades. Federal programs to assist farmers in managing risk must be as cost-effective as they are functional, offering tools that can improve producers' ability to operate when times are tough while remaining affordable to the taxpayers. Even so, the expansion of agricultural exports through the vigorous opening of new markets around the world is the surest path to farm security.\nWhile uncertainty about natural weather and markets is a risk farmers and ranchers always face, government should not add to their uncertainty by inaction and delay. Thanks in large part to a lack of leadership from the current Administration and congressional Democrats, the last Farm Bill took far too long to enact, creating instability about farm policy for nearly two years. Republicans are dedicated to leading this country forward, which includes getting things done on time, including the next Farm Bill.\nThe Democrats play politics with farm security. Much of the Democrats' delay had nothing to do with the vital role of American agriculture. It concerned their efforts to expand welfare through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which now comprises more than 70 percent of all farm bill spending. During the last eight years of a Democratic Administration, nearly all the work requirements for able-bodied adults, instituted by our landmark welfare reform of 1996, have been removed. We will restore those provisions and, to correct a mistake made when the Food Stamp program was first created in 1964, separate the administration of SNAP from the Department of Agriculture.\nLike all other sectors of our society, agriculture is directly impacted by the constant advance in technology. Agriculture now faces a revolution in the generation of \"Big Data\" — information produced not only through public oversight of regulations and programs, but also from private business records of farming and ranching operations. In the interest of protecting the safety of our farmers and ranchers, we will advance policies to protect the security, privacy, and most of all, the private ownership of individual farmers' and ranchers' data.\nThe U. S. Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture, controls around 200 million acres of land with enormous natural resources, especially timber, a renewable resource providing jobs for thousands of workers that should be used to the best economic potential for the nation. Many of our national forests are in worsening health with the threat of invasive species, insect mortality, and the severe risk of wildfire. The increase in catastrophic wildfires has been needlessly killing millions of animals and destroying homes and watersheds for decades in the western states. The expense to suppress wildfires related to failed federal forest policies continues to increase. When timber is managed properly, the renewable crops will result in fewer wildfires and, at the same time, produce jobs in the timber industry for countless families. We believe in promoting active, sustainable management of our forests and that states can best manage our forests to improve forest health and keep communities safe.\nA New Era in Energy\nOur country has greater energy resources than any other place on earth. Our engineers and miners, the men and women whose labor taps the forces of nature, are the best in the world. Together, the people of America's energy sector provide us with power that is clean, affordable, secure, and abundant. Their work can guarantee the nation's energy security for centuries to come if, instead of erecting roadblocks, government facilitates the creation of an all-of-the-above energy strategy.\nWe applaud congressional Republicans for doing just that through far-sighted legislation. Both Houses have passed bills that will modernize pipelines and the electric grid, protect the grid from disruption, expedite energy exports, and lower energy costs. A Republican administration will build on those policies to find new ways to store electricity, a breakthrough of extraordinary import.\nPlanning for our energy future requires us to first determine what resources we have in reserve. Thirty years ago, the world's estimated reserves of oil were 645 billion barrels. Today, that figure is 1.65 trillion barrels. The more we know what we will have in the future, the better we can decide how to use it. That is why we support the opening of public lands and the outer continental shelf to exploration and responsible production, even if these resources will not be immediately developed. Because we believe states can best promote economic growth while protecting the environment, Congress should give authority to state regulators to manage energy resources on federally controlled public lands within their respective borders.\nThe Democratic Party's energy policy can be summed up in a slogan currently popular among its activists: \"keep it in the ground.\" Keeping energy in the earth will keep jobs out of reach of those who need them most. For low-income Americans, expensive energy means colder homes in the winter and hotter homes in the summer, less mobility in employment, and higher food prices. The current Administration, and particularly its EPA, seems not to care. Its Clean Power Plan — the centerpiece of the President's war on coal — has been stayed by the Supreme Court. We will do away with it altogether. The Democratic Party does not understand that coal is an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource. Those who mine it and their families should be protected from the Democratic Party's radical anti-coal agenda.\nThe Democratic Party's campaign to smother the U.S. energy industry takes many forms, but the permitting process may be its most damaging weapon. It takes an average of 30 days for states to permit an oil or gas well. It takes the federal government longer than seven months. Three decades ago, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leased 12.2 million acres. In 2014, it leased only one-tenth of that number. Our nuclear industry, cleanly generating almost 20 percent of our electricity from its 99 plants, has a remarkable safety record, but only a handful of plants have been permitted in over three decades. Permitting for a safe, non-polluting hydroelectric facility, even one that is being relicensed, can take many years because of the current President's hostility to dams. The Keystone Pipeline has become a symbol of everything wrong with the current Administration's ideological approach. After years of delay, the President killed it to satisfy environmental extremists. We intend to finish that pipeline and others as part of our commitment to North American energy security.\nGovernment should not play favorites among energy producers. The taxpayers will not soon forget the current Administration's subsidies to companies that went bankrupt without producing a kilowatt of energy. The same Administration now requires the Department of Defense, operating with slashed budgets during a time of expanding conflict, to use its scarce resources to generate 25 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2025. Climate change is far from this nation's most pressing national security issue. This is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.\nWe support the development of all forms of energy that are marketable in a free economy without subsidies, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, and hydropower. A federal judge has struck down the BLM's rule on hydraulic fracturing and we support upholding this decision. We respect the states' proven ability to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, and horizontal drilling, and we will end the Administration's disregard of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act with respect to the long-term storage of nuclear waste. We encourage the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources — wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, geothermal, and tidal energy — by private capital. The United States is overwhelmingly dependent on China and other nations for rare earth and other hardrock minerals. These minerals are critical to advanced technology, renewable energy, and defense manufacturing. We support expediting the permitting process for mineral production on public lands. We support lifting restrictions to allow responsible development of nuclear energy, including research into alternative processes like thorium nuclear energy.\nWe oppose any carbon tax. It would increase energy prices across the board, hitting hardest at the families who are already struggling to pay their bills in the Democrats' no-growth economy. We urge the private sector to focus its resources on the development of carbon capture and sequestration technology still in its early stages here and overseas.\nAmerican energy producers should be free to export their product to foreign markets. This is particularly important because of international demand for liquefied natural gas, and we must expedite the energy export terminals currently blocked by the Administration. Energy exports will create high paying jobs throughout the United States, reduce our nation's trade deficit, grow our economy, and boost the energy security of our allies and trading partners. We remain committed to aggressively expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for American energy through multilateral and bilateral agreements, whether current, pending, or negotiated in the future.\nEnergy is both an economic and national security issue. We support the enactment of policies to increase domestic energy production, including production on public lands, to counter market manipulation by OPEC and other nationally-owned oil companies. This will reduce America's vulnerability to energy price volatility.\nEnvironmental Progress\nConservation is inherent in conservatism. As the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago, the Republican Party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards of the God-given natural beauty and resources of our country. We believe that people are the most valuable resources and that human health and safety are the proper measurements of a policy's success. We assert that private ownership has been the best guarantee of conscientious stewardship, while some of the worst instances of degradation have occurred under government control. Poverty, not wealth, is the gravest threat to the environment, while steady economic growth brings the technological advances which make environmental progress possible.\nThe environment is too important to be left to radical environmentalists. They are using yesterday's tools to control a future they do not comprehend. The environmental establishment has become a self-serving elite, stuck in the mindset of the 1970s, subordinating the public's consensus to the goals of the Democratic Party. Their approach is based on shoddy science, scare tactics, and centralized command-and-control regulation. Over the last eight years, the Administration has triggered an avalanche of regulation that wreaks havoc across our economy and yields minimal environmental benefits.\nThe central fact of any sensible environmental policy is that, year by year, the environment is improving. Our air and waterways are much healthier than they were a few decades ago. As a nation, we have drastically reduced pollution, mainstreamed recycling, educated the public, and avoided ecological degradation. Even if no additional controls are added, air pollution will continue to decline for the next several decades due to technological turnover of aging equipment. These successes become a challenge for Democratic Party environmental extremists, who must reach farther and demand more to sustain the illusion of an environmental crisis. That is why they routinely ignore costs, exaggerate benefits, and advocate the breaching of constitutional boundaries by federal agencies to impose environmental regulation. At the same time, the environmental establishment looks the other way when environmental degradation is caused by the EPA and other federal agencies as was the case during the Animas River spill.\nOur agenda is high on job creation, expanding opportunity and providing a better chance at life for everyone willing to work for it. Our modern approach to environmentalism is directed to that end, and it starts with dramatic change in official Washington. We propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the EPA into an independent bipartisan commission, similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with structural safeguards against politicized science. We will strictly limit congressional delegation of rule-making authority, and require that citizens be compensated for regulatory takings.\nWe will put an end to the legal practice known as \"sue and settle,\" in which environmental groups sue federal agencies whose officials are complicit in the litigation so that, with the taxpayers excluded, both parties can reach agreement behind closed doors. That deceit betrays the public's trust; it will no longer be tolerated. We will also reform the Equal Access to Justice Act to cap and disclose payments made to environmental activists and return the Act to its original intent.\nWe will enforce the original intent of the Clean Water Act, not it's distortion by EPA regulations. We will likewise forbid the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide, something never envisioned when Congress passed the Clean Air Act. We will restore to Congress the authority to set the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and modernize the permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act so it can no longer invite frivolous lawsuits, thwart sorely needed projects, kill jobs, and strangle growth.\nThe federal government owns or controls over 640 million acres of land in the United States, most of which is in the West. These are public lands, and the public should have access to them for appropriate activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Federal ownership or management of land also places an economic burden on counties and local communities in terms of lost revenue to pay for things such as schools, police, and emergency services. It is absurd to think that all that acreage must remain under the absentee ownership or management of official Washington. Congress shall immediately pass universal legislation providing for a timely and orderly mechanism requiring the federal government to convey certain federally controlled public lands to states. We call upon all national and state leaders and representatives to exert their utmost power and influence to urge the transfer of those lands, identified in the review process, to all willing states for the benefit of the states and the nation as a whole. The residents of state and local communities know best how to protect the land where they work and live. They practice boots-on-the-ground conservation in their states every day. We support amending the Antiquities Act of 1906 to establish Congress' right to approve the designation of national monuments and to further require the approval of the state where a national monument is designated or a national park is proposed.\nThere is certainly a need to protect certain species threatened worldwide with extinction. However, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) should not include species such as gray wolves and other species if these species exist elsewhere in healthy numbers in another state or country. To upset the economic viability of an area with an unneeded designation costs jobs and hurts local communities. We must ensure that this protection is done effectively, reasonably, and without unnecessarily impeding the development of lands and natural resources. The ESA should ensure that the listing of endangered species and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of compliance and the rights of property owners. Instead, over the last few decades, the ESA has stunted economic development, halted the construction of projects, burdened landowners, and has been used to pursue policy goals inconsistent with the ESA — all with little to no success in the actual recovery of species. For example, we oppose the listing of the lesser prairie chicken and the potential listing of the sage grouse. Neither species has been shown to be in actual danger and the listings threaten to devastate farmers, ranchers, and oil and gas production. While species threatened with extinction must be protected under the ESA, any such protection must be done in a reasonable and transparent manner with stakeholder input and in consideration of the impact on the development of lands and natural resources.\nInformation concerning a changing climate, especially projections into the long-range future, must be based on dispassionate analysis of hard data. We will enforce that standard throughout the executive branch, among civil servants and presidential appointees alike. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a political mechanism, not an unbiased scientific institution. Its unreliability is reflected in its intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy. We will evaluate its recommendations accordingly. We reject the agendas of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, which represent only the personal commitments of their signatories; no such agreement can be binding upon the United States until it is submitted to and ratified by the Senate.\nWe demand an immediate halt to U.S. funding for the U.N.'s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in accordance with the 1994 Foreign Relations Authorization Act. That law prohibits Washington from giving any money to \"any affiliated organization of the United Nations\" which grants Palestinians membership as a state. There is no ambiguity in that language. It would be illegal for the President to follow through on his intention to provide millions in funding for the UNFCCC and hundreds of millions for its Green Climate Fund.\nWe firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs.\nGovernment Reform\nMaking Government Work for the People\nFounding Father and Constitution Framer James Wilson declared that in America, \"the people are the masters of government,\" but that in other countries, \"the government is master of the people.\" We pledge to make government work for the people, rather than the other way around. Much of what the federal government does can be improved, much should be replaced, and much needs to be done away with or returned to the states. It is long past time for just tinkering around the edges of a bloated and unresponsive bureaucratic state. Its poorly managed programs, some begun generations ago, are ill-suited to meet present needs and future requirements. Its credit card budgets impose massive indebtedness on every American today and on children yet unborn. The more it intrudes into every aspect of American life the more it alienates the citizens who work, pay taxes, and wonder what has happened to the country they love. We agree with Thomas Jefferson that \"[t]he multiplication of public offices, increase of expense beyond income, growth and entailment of a public debt, are indications soliciting the employment of the pruning knife.\"\nBalancing the Budget\nThe federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation. The current Administration's refusal to work with Republicans took our national debt from $10 trillion to nearly $19 trillion today. Left unchecked, it will hit $30 trillion by 2026. At the same time, the Administration's policies systematically crippled economic growth and job creation, driving up government costs and driving down revenues. When Congressional Republicans tried to reverse course, the Administration manufactured fiscal crises — phony government shutdowns — to demand excessive spending. The Administration's demands have focused on significantly expanding government spending and benefits for its preferred groups, paid for through loans that our children and grandchildren will have to pay. This is the path to bankrupting the next generation.\nThe Republican path to fiscal sanity and economic expansion begins with a constitutional requirement for a federal balanced budget. We will fight for Congress to adopt, and for the states to ratify, a Balanced Budget Amendment which imposes a cap limiting spending to the appropriate historical average percentage of our nation's gross domestic product while requiring a super-majority for any tax increase, with exceptions only for war or legitimate emergencies. Only a constitutional safeguard such as this can prevent deficits from mounting to government default.\nRepublican budgets will prioritize thrift over extravagance and put taxpayers first. We support the following test: Is a particular expenditure within the constitutional scope of the federal government? If not, stop it. Has it been effective in the past and is it still absolutely necessary? If not, end it. Is it so important as to justify borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, to fund it? If not, kill it.\nPreserving Medicare and Medicaid\nMore than 100 million Americans depend on Medicare or Medicaid for their healthcare; with our population aging, that number will increase. To preserve Medicare and Medicaid, the financing of these important programs must be brought under control before they consume most of the federal budget, including national defense. The good news is that it can be done, and it can be done without endangering the elderly and the needy who depend on those programs. We intend to save Medicare by modernizing it, empowering its participants, and putting it on a secure financial footing. We will preserve the promise of Medicaid as well by making that program, designed for 1965 medicine, a vehicle for good health in an entirely new era.\nMedicare's long-term debt is in the trillions, and it is funded by a workforce that is shrinking relative to the size of future beneficiaries. Obamacare worsened the situation — and imperiled seniors — by imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare providers to pay for its new spending. When a vital program is so clearly headed for a train wreck, it's time to put it on a more secure track. That is why we propose these reforms: Impose no changes for persons 55 or older. Give others the option of traditional Medicare or transition to a premium-support model designed to strengthen patient choice, promote cost-saving competition among providers, and better guard against the fraud and abuse that now diverts billions of dollars every year away from patient care. Guarantee to every enrollee an income-adjusted contribution toward a plan of their choice, with catastrophic protection. Without disadvantaging present retirees or those nearing retirement, set a more realistic age for eligibility in light of today's longer life span.\nThis is an agenda to improve healthcare, not just to manage its costs. We reject the Democrats' approach of rationing inherent in Obamacare. We recognize the de facto rationing of healthcare caused by reduced access to doctors who increasingly opt out of participating in Medicare and Medicaid. We will not accept that or any other approach which denies care — or lowers its quality — for America's elderly.\nMedicaid presents related, but somewhat different challenges. As the dominant force in the health market with regard to long-term care, births, and persons with mental illness, it is the next frontier of welfare reform. It is simply too big and too flawed to be administered from Washington. Most of the vaunted expansion of health insurance coverage under Obamacare actually has been an unprecedented expansion of the Medicaid rolls in many states. We applaud the Republican governors and state legislators who have undertaken the hard work of modernizing Medicaid. We will give them a free hand to do so by block-granting the program without strings. Their initiatives — whether premium supports for purchasing insurance, refundable tax credits, alternatives to hospitalization for chronic patients, disease prevention activities, and other innovations — are the best strategy for preserving Medicaid for those who need it the most. Block granting Medicaid is particularly needed to address mental health care. Mental illness affects people from all walks of life, but there has been little success in developing effective system-wide medical models for addressing mental health. For a variety of unique reasons, government is often the first frontier for people experiencing mental health problems — from first responders who deal with crises to publicly funded mental health facilities and prisons where large numbers of inmates suffer from mental illnesses. Using block grants would allow states to experiment with different systems to address mental health and develop successful models to be replicated in states across the nation. The current federally dictated mental health care regime is wasteful and ineffective, and moving to a block grant approach would allow for state and local governments to create solutions for individuals and families in desperate need of help in addressing mental illness. We respect the states' authority and flexibility to exclude abortion providers from federal programs such as Medicaid and other healthcare and family planning programs so long as they continue to perform or refer for elective abortions or sell the body parts of aborted children.\nSaving Social Security\nWe reject the old maxim that Social Security is the \"Third Rail\" of American politics, deadly for anyone who would change it. The Democratic Party still treats it that way, even though everyone knows that its current course will lead to a financial and social disaster. Younger Americans have lost all faith in the program and expect little return for what they are paying into it. As the party of America's future, we accept the responsibility to preserve and modernize a system of retirement security forged in an old industrial era beyond the memory of most Americans. Current retirees and those close to retirement can be assured of their benefits. Of the many reforms being proposed, all options should be considered to preserve Social Security. As Republicans, we oppose tax increases and believe in the power of markets to create wealth and to help secure the future of our Social Security system. Saving Social Security is more than a challenge. It is our moral obligation to those who trusted in the government's word.\nProtecting Internet Freedom\nThe survival of the internet as we know it is at risk. Its gravest peril originates in the White House, the current occupant of which has launched a campaign, both at home and internationally, to subjugate it to agents of government. The President ordered the chair of the supposedly independent Federal Communications Commission to impose upon the internet rules devised in the 1930s for the telephone monopoly. He has unilaterally announced America's abandonment of the international internet by surrendering U.S. control of the root zone of web names and addresses. He threw the internet to the wolves, and they — Russia, China, Iran, and others — are ready to devour it.\nWe salute the Congressional Republicans who have legislatively impeded his plans to turn over the Information Freedom Highway to regulators and tyrants. That fight must continue, for its outcome is in doubt. We will consistently support internet policies that allow people and private enterprise to thrive, without providing new and expanded government powers to tax and regulate so that the internet does not become the vehicle for a dramatic expansion of government power. The internet's independence is its power. It has unleashed innovation, enabled growth, and inspired freedom more rapidly and extensively than any other technological advance in human history. We will therefore resist any effort to shift control toward governance by international or other intergovernmental organizations. We will ensure that personal data receives full constitutional protection from government overreach. The only way to safeguard or improve these systems is through the private sector. The internet's free market needs to be free and open to all ideas and competition without the government or service providers picking winners and losers.\nImmigration and the Rule of Law\nOur party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice. We welcome all to the Great Opportunity Party.\nThe greatest asset of the American economy is the American worker. Our immigration system must protect American working families and their wages, for citizens and legal immigrants alike, in a way that will improve the economy. Just as immigrant labor helped build our country in the past, today's legal immigrants are making vital contributions in every aspect of national life. Their industry and commitment to American values strengthens our economy, enriches our culture, and enables us to better understand and more effectively compete with the rest of the world.\nWe are particularly grateful to the thousands of new legal immigrants, many of them not yet citizens, who are serving in the Armed Forces and among first responders. Their patriotism should encourage all to embrace the newcomers legally among us, assist their journey to full citizenship, and help their communities avoid isolation from the mainstream of society. We are also thankful for the many legal immigrants who continue to contribute to American society. To that end, we both encourage the preservation of heritage tongues and support English as the nation's official language, a unifying force essential for the advancement of immigrant communities and our nation as a whole.\nAmerica's immigration policy must serve the national interest of the United States, and the interests of American workers must be protected over the claims of foreign nationals seeking the same jobs. With all our fellow citizens, we have watched, in anger and disgust, the mocking of our immigration laws by a president who made himself superior to the will of the nation. We stand with the victims of his policies, especially the families of murdered innocents. Illegal immigration endangers everyone, exploits the taxpayers, and insults all who aspire to enter America legally. We oppose any form of amnesty for those who, by breaking the law, have disadvantaged those who have obeyed it. The executive amnesties of 2012 and 2014 are a direct violation of federal law and usurp the powers of Congress as outlined in Article I of the Constitution. These unlawful amnesties must be immediately rescinded by a Republican president. In a time of terrorism, drug cartels, human trafficking, and criminal gangs, the presence of millions of unidentified individuals in this country poses grave risks to the safety and sovereignty of the United States. Our highest priority, therefore, must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws.\nThat is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. We insist upon workplace enforcement of verification systems so that more jobs can be available to all legal workers. Use of the E-verify program — an internet-based system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees — must be made mandatory nationwide. We reaffirm our endorsement of the SAVE program — Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements — to ensure that public funds are not given to persons not legally present in this country. We demand tough penalties against those who engage in identity theft, deal in fraudulent documents, and traffic in human beings. The Department of Homeland Security must use its authority to keep dangerous aliens off our streets and to expedite expulsion of criminal aliens. Gang membership should be a deportable offense. Any previously deported illegal alien who continues to show a lack of respect for our borders and rule of law must be penalized. This is why we support stiffer penalties, such as a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, for any illegal alien who illegally re-enters our nation after already having been deported.\nBecause \"sanctuary cities\" violate federal law and endanger their own citizens, they should not be eligible for federal funding. Using state licenses to reward people in the country illegally is an affront to the rule of law and must be halted.\nIn light of both current needs and historic practice, we urge the reform of our guest worker programs to eliminate fraud, improve efficiency and ensure they serve the national interest. In light of the alarming levels of unemployment and underemployment in this country, it is indefensible to continue offering lawful permanent residence to more than one million foreign nationals every year. The Supreme Court has correctly recognized that states have the constitutional authority to take steps to reduce illegal immigration. We condemn the Obama Administration's lawsuits against states that are seeking to reinforce federal law. We support the right of the states to enact laws deterring illegal aliens from residing within their states.\nFrom its beginning, our country has been a haven of refuge and asylum. That should continue — but with major changes. Asylum should be limited to cases of political, ethnic or religious persecution. As the Director of the FBI has noted, it is not possible to vet fully all potential refugees. To ensure our national security, refugees who cannot be carefully vetted cannot be admitted to the country, especially those whose homelands have been the breeding grounds for terrorism.\nReforming the Treaty System\nWe intend to restore the treaty system specified by the Constitution: The president negotiates agreements, submits them to the Senate, with ratification requiring two-thirds of the senators present and voting. This was good enough for George Washington but is too restrictive for the current chief executive, who presumes to bind this country to bilateral and multilateral agreements of his devising. His media admirers portray his personal commitments — whether on climate change, Iranian weapons, or other matters — as done deals. They are not, and a new Republican executive will work with the Congress to reestablish constitutional order in America's foreign relations. All international executive agreements and political arrangements entered into by the current Administration must be deemed null and void as mere expressions of the current president's preferences. Those which are in the national interest but would traditionally have been made by treaty must be abrogated, renegotiated as treaties, and transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent as required by the Constitution. The United States will withdraw from all agreements and arrangements failing those standards.\nInternal Revenue Service\nMany good civil servants work at the IRS, but the agency itself is toxic. Its leadership employs known tax delinquents, rehires workers previously fired for misconduct, spends user fees without congressional oversight, and awards bonuses for customer service that would put any private company out of business. Worst of all, the IRS has become an ideological attack dog for the worst elements of today's Democratic Party. It systematically targets conservative, pro-life, and libertarian organizations, harassing them with repeated audits and denying their tax exempt status. Its commissioner has lied to Congress, hidden evidence, and stonewalled investigations. He should be impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate. We value the right of America's churches, pastors, and religious leaders to preach and speak freely according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specifically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring the speech of America's churches, pastors, and religious leaders. We support repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which restricts First Amendment freedoms of all nonprofit organizations by prohibiting political speech. We also support making the federal tax code so simple and easy to understand that the IRS becomes obsolete and can be abolished.\nAudit the Pentagon\nNo major part of the Department of Defense has ever passed an audit. Republican leaders in Congress have called for a full financial audit of the Pentagon to ensure that every dollar spent is truly benefitting our national security. Every taxpayer must be prepared to pass an audit, and we urge Congress to demand the same level of accountability from the Pentagon and the Department of Defense.\nImproving the Federal Workforce\nWe recognize the dedication of most employees of the federal government and thank them for their service, with special praise for the whistleblowers who risk their careers to expose waste, fraud, and misuse of power. None of them should ever be compelled to join a union or pay dues to it. In fairness to their fellow workers, union representatives should not be allowed to engage in union-related activities while on the public's time. The inability of federal managers to discipline and, if necessary, dismiss problem staff members is an affront to every conscientious worker, as is the misuse of funds for lavish conferences and routine bonuses. The appointees of a Republican president will work with career managers to end those abuses and enforce high standards for all federal employees. We reaffirm the existing protections that provide all employees of the federal government the opportunity to pursue their desire to serve their country free from discrimination.\nWe call for renewed efforts to reduce, rather than expand, government responsibilities, and we urge particular attention to the bloated public relations budgets of the departments and agencies. The federal government spends too much of the people's money telling the people what they should do.\nAdvancing Term Limits\nOur national platform has repeatedly endorsed term limits for Members of Congress. In response, the GOP Leadership in 1996 brought to a vote, in both the House and Senate, a constitutional amendment. It failed to secure the necessary two-thirds vote in the House, where 80 percent of Republicans voted for it and 80 percent of Democrats voted against it. Every Senate Republican voted to allow a vote on term limits, but the Democrats killed it by a filibuster. Blocked by that opposition, Republicans sought other ways to modernize the national legislature. They set term limits for their own committee chairs and leadership positions, and by law they required Congress to live by the same rules it imposes on others. To make further progress, to advance a constitutional amendment for consideration by the states, we must expand the current Republican majorities in both chambers.\nRegulation: The Quiet Tyranny\nOver-regulation is the quiet tyranny of the \"Nanny State.\" It hamstrings American businesses and hobbles economic growth. The Great Recession may be over, but in the experience of most Americans, the economy is still sick. The federal regulatory burden has been a major contributor to that stagnation.\nThe ability of the American people to govern themselves has been undermined by a vast array of agencies with sweeping power to regulate every aspect of American life. They legislate as if they were Congress. They decide guilt and issue penalties as if they were courts. They collectively impose many billions of dollars in costs to the economy. The current President and his allies on Capitol Hill have used those agencies as a super-legislature, disregarding the separation of powers, to declare as law what they could not push through the Congress.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has rewritten laws to advance the Democrats' climate change agenda. The Department of Health and Human Services has ignored the enacted text of the Affordable Care Act to do whatever it wants in healthcare. Both the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board have scrapped decades of labor law to implement the agenda of big labor. The Dodd-Frank law, the Democrats' legislative Godzilla, is crushing small and community banks and other lenders. The Federal Communications Commission is imperiling the freedom of the internet. We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment.\nSensible regulations can be compatible with a vibrant economy. They can prevent the strong from exploiting the weak. Right now, the regulators are exploiting everyone. We are determined to make regulations minimally intrusive, confined to their legal mandate, and respectful toward the creation of new and small businesses. We will revisit existing laws that delegate too much authority to regulatory agencies and review all current regulations for possible reform or repeal. We endorse Republican legislation, already passed by the House, to require approval by both houses of Congress for any rule or regulation that would impose significant costs on the American people. Further, Congress should work towards legislation that requires removal of a regulation of equal or greater economic burden when a new regulation is enacted.\nBecause regulations are just another tax on the consumers, Congress should consider a regulatory budget that would cap the costs federal agencies could impose on the economy in any given year.\nCrony Capitalism and Corporate Welfare\nCronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state. When government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies, it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system. By enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats, it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism. It is the enemy of reform in education, the workplace, and healthcare. It gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small. It is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law, which is packed with corporate welfare. Crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks, custom-designed regulations, and special exemptions for favored parties. The Solyndra debacle is a perfect example. It creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other. By putting the weight of government behind the status quo, it leads to economic stagnation. We applaud the Republican Members of Congress who have taken the lead in fighting crony capitalism and urge others to rally to their cause.\nHonoring Our Relationship with American Indians\nBased on both treaty and other law, the federal government has a unique government-to-government relationship with and trust responsibility for Indian Tribal Governments, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. These obligations have not been sufficiently honored. The social and economic problems that plague Indian country have grown worse over the last several decades; we must reverse that trend. Ineffective federal programs deprive American Indians of the services they need, and long-term failures threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself.\nAmerican Indians have established elected tribal governments to carry out the public policies of the tribe, administer services to its tribal member constituents, and manage relations with federal, state, and local governments. We respect the tribal governments as the voice of their communities and encourage federal, state, and local governments to heed those voices in developing programs and partnerships to improve the quality of life for American Indians and their neighbors in their communities.\nRepublicans believe that economic self-sufficiency is the ultimate answer to the challenges confronting Indian country. We believe that tribal governments and their communities, not Washington bureaucracies, are best situated to craft solutions that will end systemic problems that create poverty and disenfranchisement. Just as the federal government should not burden states with regulations, it should not stifle the development of resources within the reservations, which need federal assistance to advance their commerce nationally through roads and technology. Federal and state regulations that thwart job creation must be withdrawn or redrawn so that tribal governments acting on behalf of American Indians are not disadvantaged. It is especially egregious that the Democratic Party has persistently undermined tribal sovereignty in order to provide advantage to union bosses in the tribal workplace. Native communities should have the same authority as state governments in labor matters, so that union bosses and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot undermine the authority of tribal governments.\nRepublicans recognize that each tribe has the right of consultation before any new regulatory policy is implemented on tribal land. To the extent possible, such consultation should take place in Indian country with the tribal government and its members. Before promulgating and imposing any new laws or regulations affecting trust land or members, the federal government should encourage Indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives, and should defer to tribes to develop their own standards, or standards in conjunction with state governments.\nRepublicans reject a one-size-fits-all approach to federal-tribal-state partnerships and will work to expand local autonomy where tribal governments seek it. Better partnerships will help us to expand economic opportunity, deliver top-flight education to future generations, modernize and improve the Indian Health Service to make it more responsive to local needs, and build essential infrastructure in Indian country in cooperation with tribal neighbors. Our approach is to empower American Indians, through tribal self-determination and self-governance policies, to develop their greatest assets, human resources and the rich natural resources on their lands, without undue federal interference.\nLike all Americans, American Indians want safe communities for their families; but inadequate resources and neglect have, over time, allowed criminal activities to plague Indian country. To protect everyone — and especially the most vulnerable: children, women, and elders — the legal system in tribal communities must provide stability and protect property rights. Everyone's due process and civil rights must be safeguarded.\nWe support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by American Indians, including Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians, and to preserve their culture and languages that we consider to be national treasures. Lastly, we recognize that American Indians have responded to the call for military service in percentage numbers far greater than have other groups of Americans. We honor that commitment, loyalty, and sacrifice of all American Indians serving in the military today and in years past and will ensure that all veterans and their families receive the care and respect they have earned through their loyal service to America.\nAmericans in the Territories\nThroughout the history of our nation, the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the territories of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico has often gone unacknowledged. Year after year, the citizens quietly, without fanfare, send their sons and daughters into the U.S. Armed Services. We honor the extraordinary sacrifices of the men and women of the territories who protect our freedom through their service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Geographically, the territories and commonwealths, especially those in the Pacific, are of vital importance to our national security as the outermost line of defense and gateway to America against potential encroachment by foreign powers. We welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process and affirm their right to seek the full extension of the Constitution with all the rights and responsibilities that entails.\nWe recognize the challenges facing all the U.S. territories in an era of dramatic global economic change. They need venture capital to retain existing industries and develop new ones. A stronger private sector can reduce dependence on public employment and lead toward self-sufficiency. Their development of local energy options will be crucial to reduce dependence on costly imported fuel.\nThe territories' economic stability and potential for growth must be considered in any trade agreements between the United States and other Pacific nations. They should be given flexibility or exemption from laws that increase costs for their populations, such as the minimum wage and the Jones Act concerning shipping. All unreasonable impediments to their prosperity should be removed, including unreasonable U.S. customs practices. Territories such as American Samoa should be able to properly develop their resources, including fishing, when jobs and the economy depend on it.\nWe call for the appointment of a commonwealth and territories advisory committee consisting of representatives from all five U.S. territories. The committee will be integrated into the president's transition team and be tasked with performing a holistic review of all federal regulations affecting the territories and commonwealths. We further call for the appointment of a Special Assistant to the President responsible for day-to-day interaction with the territories and commonwealths. This position will be the direct connection for the Office of Insular Affairs, the citizens of the territories and commonwealths, and the White House.\nThe Territory of Puerto Rico\nWe support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state. We further recognize the historic significance of the 2012 local referendum in which a 54 percent majority voted to end Puerto Rico's current status as a U.S. territory, and 61 percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood. We support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an Act of Congress in 2014 to ascertain the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. Once the 2012 local vote for statehood is ratified, Congress should approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico's future admission as the 51st state of the Union.\nPreserving the District of Columbia\nThe nation's capital city is a special responsibility of the federal government because it belongs both to its residents and to all Americans, millions of whom visit it every year. Congressional Republicans have fostered homeownership and open access to higher education for Washington residents. Against the opposition of the current President and leaders of the Democratic Party, they have established and expanded the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, through which thousands of low-income children have been able to attend a school of their choice and receive a quality education.\nRepublicans have been in the forefront of combating chronic corruption among the city's top Democratic officials. We call for congressional action to enforce the spirit of the Home Rule Act, assuring minority representation on the City Council. That council, backed by the current mayor, is attempting to seize from the Congress its appropriating power over all funding for the District. The illegality of their action mirrors the unacceptable spike in violent crime and murders currently afflicting the city. We expect Congress to assert, by whatever means necessary, its constitutional prerogatives regarding the District.\nSince the Supreme Court's decisions affirming the Second Amendment rights of its citizens, city officials have engaged in a campaign of massive resistance by denying virtually all applications for gun ownership. The Republican Congress should be prepared, upon the inauguration of a Republican president, to enact legislation allowing law-abiding Washingtonians to own and carry firearms.\nStatehood for the District can be advanced only by a constitutional amendment. Any other approach would be invalid. A statehood amendment was soundly rejected by the states when last proposed in 1976 and should not be revived.\nGreat American Families, Education, Healthcare, and Criminal Justice\nAmerican Values\nWe are the party of independent individuals and the institutions they create together — families, schools, congregations, neighborhoods — to advance their ideals and make real their dreams. Those institutions, standing between the citizen and the power of government, are the pillars of a free society. They create spaces where the power of government should not intrude. They allow Americans to work together to solve most of the problems facing their communities. They thus reduce the need for intervention by government in the form of more and bigger programs or a larger public workforce. They minimize decision-making by those who hold or are appointed to office. That is precisely why today's progressives distrust and seek to control them — because this is more than a conflict of ideas. It is a struggle for power.\nOur society is at a crossroads. For several generations, an expansive federal regime has marginalized and supplanted the institutions holding our society together. No wonder, then, that so much seems to be coming apart now. The question is whether we are going to reinvigorate the private-sector institutions under citizen control or allow their continued erosion by the forces of centralized social planning. In that divide, the Republican Party stands with the people.\nMarriage, Family, and Society\nForemost among those institutions is the American family. It is the foundation of civil society, and the cornerstone of the family is natural marriage, the union of one man and one woman. Its daily lessons — cooperation, patience, mutual respect, responsibility, self-reliance — are fundamental to the order and progress of our Republic. Strong families, depending upon God and one another, advance the cause of liberty by lessening the need for government in their daily lives. Conversely, as we have learned over the last five decades, the loss of faith and family life leads to greater dependence upon government. That is why Republicans formulate public policy, from taxation to education, from healthcare to welfare, with attention to the needs and strengths of the family.\nIt is also why everyone should be concerned about the state of the American family today, not because of ideology or doctrine, but because of the overwhelming evidence of experience, social science, and common sense. All of which give us these truths about traditional marriage: Children raised in a two-parent household tend to be physically and emotionally healthier, more likely to do well in school, less likely to use drugs and alcohol, engage in crime or become pregnant outside of marriage. We oppose policies and laws that create a financial incentive for or encourage cohabitation. Moreover, marriage remains the greatest antidote to child poverty. The 40 percent of children who now are born outside of marriage are five times more likely to live in poverty than youngsters born and raised by a mother and father in the home. Nearly three-quarters of the $450 billion government annually spends on welfare goes to single-parent households. This is what it takes for a governmental village to raise a child, and the village is doing a tragically poor job of it.\nThe data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion: Every child deserves a married mom and dad. The reality remains that millions of American families do not have the advantages that come with that structure. We honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens of parenting alone and embrace the principle that all Americans should be treated with dignity and respect. But respect is not enough. Our laws and our government's regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society. For that reason, as explained elsewhere in this platform, we do not accept the Supreme Court's redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal, whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to the states. We oppose government discrimination against businesses or entities which decline to sell items or services to individuals for activities that go against their religious views about such activities.\nFamilies formed or enlarged by adoption strengthen our communities and ennoble our nation. Private entities which facilitate adoptions enrich our communities. We support measures such as the First Amendment Defense Act to ensure these entities do not face government discrimination because of their views on marriage and family. We applaud the Republican initiatives which have led to an increase in adoptions, an achievement which should be recognized in any restructuring of the federal tax code. While the number of children in foster care has stabilized, teens who age out of that setting often are abruptly left to face the world on their own. We urge states and community groups to help these young adults become independent.\nThirty years ago, President Reagan commissioned a Special Working Group on the Family to study how government at all levels could be more supportive of family life. We urge marriage penalties to be removed from the tax code and public assistance programs. We invite all who care about children to join us in this proposal to ensure that all federal programs, in the words of President Kennedy, \"stress the integrity and preservation of the family unit.\"\nA Culture of Hope\nWe have been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years and poverty is winning. Our social safety net — about 80 separate means-tested programs costing over $1 trillion every year — is designed to help people born into or falling into poverty. It rarely lifts them out. Its apologists judge success by the amount of money spent to keep people in the system. That is a cruel measurement. Republicans propose to evaluate a poverty program by whether it actually reduces poverty and increases the personal independence of its participants. The results are damning: intergenerational poverty has persisted and worsened since 1966.\nThis year marks another important anniversary; it has been 20 years since the landmark Republican welfare reform of 1996 broke away from the discredited Great Society model. By making welfare a benefit instead of an entitlement, it put millions of recipients on a transition from dependence to independence. Welfare rolls declined by half as recipients and prospective recipients discovered a better way to reach their goals. Best of all, about 3 million children moved out of poverty. Today that progress has been lost. Defying the law as it was plainly written, the current Administration has nullified any meaningful work requirement and made TANF a mockery of the name we gave it: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. This decision ensures that those families will remain needy and cut off from the economic mainstream of American society.\nThis is the progressive pathology: Keeping people dependent so that government can redistribute income. The result is 45.8 million people on food stamps and 77 million on Medicaid, plus another 5.7 million in the Children's Health Insurance Program. This is the false compassion of the status quo. We propose instead the dynamic compassion of work requirements in a growing economy, where opportunity takes the place of a hand-out, where true self-esteem can grow from the satisfaction of a job well done.\nWe call for removal of structural impediments which progressives throw in the path of poor people: Over-regulation of start-up enterprises, excessive licensing requirements, needless restrictions on formation of schools and day-care centers serving neighborhood families, and restrictions on providing public services in fields like transport and sanitation that close the opportunity door to all but a favored few. We will continue our fight for school choice until all parents can find good, safe schools for their children. To protect religious liberty we will ensure that faith-based institutions, especially those that are vital parts of underserved neighborhoods, do not face discrimination by government. We propose new partnerships between those who manage federal programs and those who are on the front lines of fighting poverty on the ground. We must encourage their efforts to reclaim their communities from the culture of poverty. To advance this process, we urge greater state and local responsibility for, and control over, public assistance programs.\nEducation: A Chance for Every Child\nEducation is much more than schooling. It is the whole range of activities by which families and communities transmit to a younger generation, not just knowledge and skills, but ethical and behavioral norms and traditions. It is the handing over of a cultural identity. That is why American education has, for the last several decades, been the focus of constant controversy, as centralizing forces from outside the family and community have sought to remake education in order to remake America. They have done immense damage. The federal government should not be a partner in that effort, as the Constitution gives it no role in education. At the heart of the American Experiment lies the greatest political expression of human dignity: The self-evident truth that \"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\" That truth rejects the dark view of the individual as human capital — a possession for the creation of another's wealth.\nParents are a child's first and foremost educators, and have primary responsibility for the education of their children. Parents have a right to direct their children's education, care, and upbringing. We support a constitutional amendment to protect that right from interference by states, the federal government, or international bodies such as the United Nations. We reject a one-size-fits-all approach to education and support a broad range of choices for parents and children at the state and local level. We likewise repeat our long-standing opposition to the imposition of national standards and assessments, encourage the parents and educators who are implementing alternatives to Common Core, and congratulate the states which have successfully repealed it. Their education reform movement calls for choice-based, parent-driven accountability at every stage of schooling. It affirms higher expectations for all students and rejects the crippling bigotry of low expectations. It recognizes the wisdom of local control of our schools and it wisely sees consumer rights in education — choice — as the most important driving force for renewing education. It rejects excessive testing and \"teaching to the test\" and supports the need for strong assessments to serve as a tool so teachers can tailor teaching to meet student needs.\nWe applaud America's great teachers, who should be protected against frivolous lawsuits and should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain discipline and order in the classroom. Administrators need flexibility to innovate and to hold accountable all those responsible for student performance. A good understanding of the Bible being indispensable for the development of an educated citizenry, we encourage state legislatures to offer the Bible in a literature curriculum as an elective in America's high schools. We urge school districts to make use of teaching talent in the business community, STEM fields, and the military, especially among our returning veterans. Rigid tenure systems should be replaced with a merit-based approach in order to attract the best talent to the classroom. All personnel who interact with school children should pass background checks and be held to the highest standards of personal conduct.\nAcademic Excellence for All\nMaintaining American preeminence requires a world-class system of education in which all students can reach their potential. Republicans are leading the effort to create it. Since 1965, the federal government, through more than 100 programs in the Department of Education, has spent $2 trillion on elementary and secondary education with little substantial improvement in academic achievement or high school graduation rates. The United States spends an average of more than $12,000 per pupil per year in public schools, for a total of more than $620 billion. That represents more than 4 percent of GDP devoted to K-12 education in 2011-2012. Of that amount, federal spending amounted to more than $57 billion. Clearly, if money were the solution, our schools would be problem-free.\nMore money alone does not necessarily equal better performance. After years of trial and error, we know the policies and methods that have actually made a difference in student advancement: Choice in education; building on the basics; STEM subjects and phonics; career and technical education; ending social promotions; merit pay for good teachers; classroom discipline; parental involvement; and strong leadership by principals, superintendents, and locally elected school boards. Because technology has become an essential tool of learning, it must be a key element in our efforts to provide every child equal access and opportunity. We strongly encourage instruction in American history and civics by using the original documents of our founding fathers.\nChoice in Education\nWe support options for learning, including home-schooling, career and technical education, private or parochial schools, magnet schools, charter schools, online learning, and early-college high schools. We especially support the innovative financing mechanisms that make options available to all children: education savings accounts (ESAs), vouchers, and tuition tax credits. Empowering families to access the learning environments that will best help their children to realize their full potential is one of the greatest civil rights challenges of our time. A young person's ability to succeed in school must be based on his or her God-given talent and motivation, not an address, ZIP code, or economic status. We propose that the bulk of federal money through Title I for low-income children and through IDEA for children with special needs should follow the child to whatever school the family thinks will work best for them.\nIn sum, on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for K-12 public education with overall results that do not justify that spending level. On the other hand, the common experience of families, teachers, and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education. In Congress and in the states, Republicans are bridging the gap between those two realities. Congressional Republicans are leading the way forward with major reform legislation advancing the concept of block grants and repealing numerous federal regulations which have interfered with state and local control of public schools. Their Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act — modernizing workforce programs, repealing mandates, and advancing employment for persons with disabilities — is now law. Their legislation to require transparency in unfunded mandates imposed upon our schools is advancing. Their D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program should be expanded as a model for the rest of the country. We deplore the efforts of Congressional Democrats and the current President to eliminate this successful program for disadvantaged students in order to placate the leaders of the teachers' unions.\nTo ensure that all students have access to the mainstream of American life, we support the English First approach and oppose divisive programs that limit students' ability to advance in American society. We renew our call for replacing \"family planning\" programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior. That approach — the only one always effective against premarital pregnancy and sexually-transmitted disease — empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes. We oppose school-based clinics that provide referral or counseling for abortion and contraception and believe that federal funds should not be used in mandatory or universal mental health, psychiatric, or socio-emotional screening programs. The federal government has pushed states to collect and share vast amounts of personal student and family data, including the collection of social and emotional data. Much of this data is collected without parental consent or notice. This is wholly incompatible with the American Experiment and our inalienable rights.\nTitle IX\nWe emphatically support the original, authentic meaning of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. It affirmed that \"no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" That language opened up for girls and women a world of opportunities that had too often been denied to them. That same provision of law is now being used by bureaucrats — and by the current President of the United States — to impose a social and cultural revolution upon the American people by wrongly redefining sex discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories. Their agenda has nothing to do with individual rights; it has everything to do with power. They are determined to reshape our schools — and our entire society — to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America's history and traditions. Their edict to the states concerning restrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities is at once illegal, dangerous, and ignores privacy issues. We salute the several states which have filed suit against it.\nSexual assault is a terrible crime. We commend the good-faith efforts by law enforcement, educational institutions, and their partners to address that crime responsibly. Whenever reported, it must be promptly investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted in a courtroom, not a faculty lounge. Questions of guilt or innocence must be decided by a judge and jury, with guilt determined beyond a reasonable doubt. Those convicted of sexual assault should be punished to the full extent of the law. The Administration's distortion of Title IX to micromanage the way colleges and universities deal with allegations of abuse contravenes our country's legal traditions and must be halted before it further muddles this complex issue and prevents the proper authorities from investigating and prosecuting sexual assault effectively with due process.\nImproving Higher Education\nOur colleges, universities, and trade schools, large and small, public and private, form the world's greatest assemblage of learning. They drive much of the research that keeps America competitive and, by admitting large numbers of foreign students, convey our values and culture to the world. Their excellence is undermined by an ideological bias deeply entrenched within the current university system. Whatever the solution may be in private institutions, in state schools the trustees have a responsibility to the taxpayers to ensure that their enormous investment is not abused for political indoctrination. We call on state officials to preserve our public colleges, universities, and trade schools as places of learning and the exchange of ideas, not zones of intellectual intolerance or \"safe zones,\" as if college students need protection from the free exchange of ideas. A student's First Amendment rights do not end at the schoolhouse gates. Colleges, universities, and trade schools must not infringe on their freedom of speech and association in the name of political correctness. We condemn the campus-based BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) campaign against Israel. It is anti-Semitism and should be denounced by advocates of academic freedom.\nCollege Costs\nThe cost of a college education has long been on an unsustainable trajectory, rising year by year far ahead of inflation. Nationwide, student debt now exceeds credit card debt with average debt levels per student totaling roughly $27,000. Delinquency rates on student loans are now as high as they were on subprime mortgages during the housing crisis. Over half of recent college grads are unemployed or underemployed, working at jobs for which their expensive educations gave them no preparation. We need new systems of learning to compete with traditional four-year schools: Technical institutions, online universities, life-long learning, and work-based learning in the private sector. Public policy should advance their affordability, innovation, and transparency and should recognize that a four-year degree from a brick-and-mortar institution is not the only path toward a prosperous and fulfilling career.\nThe federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans. In order to bring down college costs and give students access to a multitude of financing options, private sector participation in student financing should be restored. Any regulation that increases college costs must be challenged to balance its worth against its negative economic impact on students and their families.\nIn order to encourage new modes of higher education delivery to enter the market, accreditation should be decoupled from federal financing, and states should be empowered to allow a wide array of accrediting and credentialing bodies to operate. This model would foster innovation, bring private industry into the credentialing market, and give students the ability to customize their college experience.\nRestoring Patient Control and Preserving Quality in Healthcare\nAny honest agenda for improving healthcare must start with repeal of the dishonestly named Affordable Care Act of 2010: Obamacare. It weighs like the dead hand of the past upon American medicine. It imposed a Euro-style bureaucracy to manage its unworkable, budget-busting, conflicting provisions. It has driven up prices for all consumers. Their insurance premiums have dramatically increased while their deductibles have risen about eight times faster than wages in the last ten years. It drove up drug prices by levying a $27 billion tax on manufacturers and importers and, through mandated price cuts for drugs under Medicare and Medicaid, forced pharmaceutical companies to raise prices for everyone else. Its \"silver plans,\" the most common option on the government insurance exchanges, limit people's access to their own doctor through narrow networks and restrict drug coverage, forcing many patients to pay for extremely costly medicines for their chronic diseases.\nWe agree with the four dissenting judges of the Supreme Court: \"In our view, the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety.\" It must be removed and replaced with an approach based on genuine competition, patient choice, excellent care, wellness, and timely access to treatment. To that end, a Republican president, on the first day in office, will use legitimate waiver authority under the law to halt its advance and then, with the unanimous support of Congressional Republicans, will sign its repeal. The Supreme Court upheld Obamacare based on Congress' power to tax. It is time to repeal Obamacare and give America a much-needed tax cut.\nIn its place we must combine what worked best in the past with changes needed for the future. We must recover the traditional patient-physician relationship based on mutual trust, informed consent, and confidentiality. To simplify the system for both patients and providers, we will reduce mandates and enable insurers and providers of care to increase healthcare options and contain costs. Our goal is to ensure that all Americans have improved access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, including those struggling with mental illness.\nWe will return to the states their historic role of regulating local insurance markets, limit federal requirements on both private insurance and Medicaid, and call on state officials to reconsider the costly medical mandates, imposed under their own laws, that price millions of low-income families out of the insurance market. To guarantee first-rate care for the needy, we propose to block grant Medicaid and other payments and to assist all patients, including those with pre-existing conditions, to obtain coverage in a robust consumer market. Through Obamacare, the current Administration has promoted the notion of abortion as healthcare. We, however, affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life. Numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and well-being of women, and we stand firmly against it.\nTo ensure vigorous competition in healthcare, and because cost-awareness is the best guard against over-utilization, we will promote price transparency so consumers can know the cost of treatments before they agree to them. We will empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured. We believe that individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain continuous coverage should be protected from discrimination. We applaud the advance of technology in electronic medical records while affirming patient privacy and ownership of personal health information.\nConsumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform. Today's highly mobile workforce needs portability of insurance coverage that can go with them from job to job. The need to maintain coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work. We propose to end tax discrimination against the individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines. In light of that, we propose repealing the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act which protects insurance companies from anti-trust litigation. We look to the growth of Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts that empower patients and advance choice in healthcare.\nOur aging population must have access to safe and affordable care. Because most seniors desire to age at home, we will make homecare a priority in public policy and will implement programs to protect against elder abuse.\nProtecting Individual Conscience in Healthcare\nAmerica's healthcare professionals should not be forced to choose between following their faith and practicing their profession. We respect the rights of conscience of healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and organizations, especially the faith-based groups which provide a major portion of care for the nation and the needy. We support the ability of all organizations to provide, purchase, or enroll in healthcare coverage consistent with their religious, moral, or ethical convictions without discrimination or penalty. We support the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. We support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their minor children and urge enactment of legislation that would require parental consent for their daughter to be transported across state lines for abortion. Providers should not be permitted to unilaterally withhold services because a patient's life is deemed not worth living. American taxpayers should not be forced to fund abortion. As Democrats abandon this four decade-old bipartisan consensus, we call for codification of the Hyde Amendment and its application across the government, including Obamacare. We call for a permanent ban on federal funding and subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion coverage.\nBetter Care and Lower Costs: Tort Reform\nMedical malpractice lawsuits have ballooned the cost of healthcare for everyone by forcing physicians to practice defensive medicine through tests and treatments which otherwise might be optional. Rural America is especially affected as obstetricians, surgeons, and other providers move to urban settings or retire in the face of escalating insurance premiums. Many Republican Governors have advanced the legal reforms necessary to reverse that trend. We support state and federal legislation to cap non-economic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits, thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of higher medical bills.\nAdvancing Research and Development in Healthcare\nAmerican medicine is poised to enter a new era of technological advance. Federal and private investment in basic and applied biomedical research holds enormous promise, especially with diseases and disorders like autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. Just as we today take for granted wonders that seemed impossible a few decades ago — MRIs and CAT scans, robotic surgery, and in utero treatment — patients a decade hence will have care and treatment that will make much of today's medicine look primitive. Modern miracles involving genetics, the immune system, cures for deadly diseases, and more are in the research pipeline. This is the consequence of marrying significant investment, both public and private, with the world's best talent, a formula that has for a century given the American people the world's best healthcare. We are determined that it should continue to do so, especially as we confront new dangers like Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.\nTo continue our headway against breast and prostate cancer, diabetes, and other killers, research must consider the needs of formerly neglected demographic groups. We call for expanded support for the stem cell research that now offers the greatest hope for many afflictions — through adult stem cells, umbilical cord blood, and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells — without the destruction of embryonic human life. We urge a ban on human cloning for research or reproduction, and a ban on the creation of, or experimentation on, human embryos for research. We applaud Congress' ban on the FDA approval of research involving three-parent embryos. We believe the FDA's approval of Mifeprex, a dangerous abortifacient formerly known as RU-486, threatens women's health, as does the agency's endorsement of over-the-counter sales of powerful contraceptives without a physician's recommendation. We support cutting federal and state funding for entities that endanger women's health by performing abortions in a manner inconsistent with federal or state law.\nPutting Patients First: Reforming the FDA\nThe United States has led life sciences and medical innovation for decades, bringing millions of high-paying jobs to our country and helping Americans and people around the world live longer, healthier lives. Unfortunately, the continuously increasing burden of governmental regulation and red tape is taking its toll on our innovative companies, and their pipeline of new life-saving devices and drugs to our nation's patients is slowing and diminishing. The FDA has slowly but relentlessly changed into an agency that more and more puts the public health at risk by delaying, chilling, and killing the development of new devices, drugs and biologics that can promote our lives and our health. The FDA needs leadership that can reform the agency for our century and fix the lack of predictability, consistency, transparency and efficiency at the agency. The FDA needs to return to its traditional emphasis on hard science and approving new breakthrough medicines, rather than divert its attention and consume its resources trying to overregulate electronic health records or vaping. We pledge to restore the FDA to its position as the premier scientific health agency, focused on both promoting and protecting the public health in equal measure, so we can ensure that Americans live longer, healthier lives, that the United States remains the world leader in life sciences and medical innovation, that millions of high-paying, cutting-edge device and drug jobs stay in the United States, that U.S. patients benefit first and most from new devices and drugs, and that the FDA no longer wastes U.S. taxpayer and innovators' resources through bureaucratic red tape and legal uncertainty. We commend those states that have passed Right to Try legislation, allowing terminally ill patients the right to try investigational medicines not yet approved by the FDA. We urge Congress to pass federal legislation to give all Americans with terminal illnesses the right to try.\nAdvancing Americans with Disabilities\nUnder the last two Republican presidents, landmark civil rights legislation affirmed the inherent rights of persons with disabilities. Republicans want to support those rights by guaranteeing access to education and the tools necessary to compete in the mainstream of society. This is not just a moral obligation to our fellow Americans with disabilities. It is our duty to our country's future to tap this vast pool of talented individuals who want to work and contribute to the common good. For that reason, Republican leadership led to enactment of the ABLE Act (Achieving a Better Life Experience) and the Steve Gleason Act. The former, for the first time, lets people with disabilities maintain access to services while saving to develop assets. The latter, bearing the name of the former NFL player with ALS, provides access to speech-generating devices. In addition, our Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will make it easier for students with disabilities to pursue competitive employment.\nPersons with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to be self-employed as the general population. To encourage their entrepreneurship, it makes sense to include them in the Small Business Administration's 8(a) certification program, which opens up federal contracting for emerging businesses. Any restructuring of the tax code should consider ways in which companies can benefit from the talent and energy of their disabled employees.\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has opened up unprecedented opportunities for many students. Congressional Republicans will lead in its reauthorization, as well as renewal of the Higher Education Act, which can offer students with disabilities increased access to the general curriculum. Our TIME Act (Transition to Integrated and Meaningful Employment) will modernize the Fair Labor Standards Act to encourage competitive employment for persons with disabilities. We affirm our support for its goal of minimizing the separation of children with disabilities from their peers. We endorse efforts like Employment First that replace dependency with jobs in the mainstream of the American workforce.\nWe oppose the non-consensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities, including newborns, the elderly, and infirm, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide, which endanger especially those on the margins of society. We urge the Drug Enforcement Administration to restore its ban on the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide.\nEnsuring Safe Neighborhoods: Criminal Justice and Prison Reform\nThe men and women of law enforcement — whether patrolling our neighborhoods or our borders, fighting organized crime or guarding against domestic terror — deserve our gratitude and support. Their jobs are never easy, especially in crisis situations, and should not be made more difficult by politicized second-guessing from federal officials. The current Administration's lack of respect for them, from White House intervention in local arrests to the Attorney General's present campaign of harassment against police forces around the country, has been unprecedented. With all Americans, we mourn those whom we have lost to violence and hatred. To honor their sacrifice, we recommit ourselves, as individuals and as a party, to the rule of law and the pursuit of justice.\nThe conduct of the Department of Justice has included refusal to enforce laws, stonewalling congressional committees, destroying evidence, reckless dealing with firearms that led to several deaths on both sides of our border, and defying a citation for contempt. It has urged leniency for rioters while turning a blind eye to mob attacks on peaceful citizens exercising their political rights. A new administration must ensure the immediate dismissal and, where appropriate, prosecution of any Department officials who have violated their oath of office.\nThe next president must restore the public's trust in law enforcement and civil order by first adhering to the rule of law himself. Additionally, the next president must not sow seeds of division and distrust between the police and the people they have sworn to serve and protect. The Republican Party, a party of law and order, must make clear in words and action that every human life matters.\nTwo grave problems undermine the rule of law on the federal level: Over-criminalization and over-federalization. In the first case, Congress and federal agencies have increased the number of criminal offenses in the U.S. Code from 3,000 in the early 1980s to more than 4,500 today. That does not include an estimated 300,000 regulations containing criminal penalties. No one, including the Department of Justice, can come up with accurate numbers. That recklessness is bad enough when committed by Congress, but when it comes from the unelected bureaucrats of the federal agencies, it is intolerable. The power of career civil servants and political appointees to criminalize behavior is one of the worst violations of constitutional order perpetrated by the administrative state.\nTo deal with this morass, we urge caution in the creation of new \"crimes\" and a bipartisan presidential commission to purge the Code and the body of regulations of old \"crimes.\" We call for mens rea elements in the definition of any new crimes to protect Americans who, in violating a law, act unknowingly or without criminal intent. We urge Congress to codify the Common Law's Rule of Lenity, which requires courts to interpret unclear statutes in favor of a defendant.\nThe over-federalization of criminal justice is one of many ways in which the government in Washington has intruded beyond its proper jurisdiction. The essential role of federal law enforcement personnel in protecting federal property and combating interstate crime should not be compromised by diversion to matters properly handled by state and local authorities.\nWe applaud the Republican Governors and legislators who have been implementing criminal justice reforms like those proposed by our 2012 platform. Along with diversion of first-time, nonviolent offenders to community sentencing, accountability courts, drug courts, veterans treatment courts, and guidance by faith-based institutions with proven track records of rehabilitation, our platform emphasized restorative justice to make the victim whole and put the offender on the right path. As variants of these reforms are undertaken in many states, we urge the Congress to learn from what works. In the past, judicial discretion about sentences led to serious mistakes concerning dangerous criminals. Mandatory minimum sentencing became an important tool for keeping them off the streets. Modifications to it should be targeted toward particular categories, especially nonviolent offenders and persons with drug, alcohol, or mental health issues, and should require disclosure by the courts of any judicial departure from the state's sentencing requirements.\nThe constitutionality of the death penalty is firmly settled by its explicit mention in the Fifth Amendment. With the murder rate soaring in our great cities, we condemn the Supreme Court's erosion of the right of the people to enact capital punishment in their states. In solidarity with those who protect us, we call for mandatory prison time for all assaults involving serious injury to law enforcement officers.\nWe call on the Congress to make the federal courts a model for the rest of the country in protecting the rights of victims and their families. They should be told all relevant information about their case, allowed to be present for its trial, assured a voice in sentencing and parole hearings, given access to social and legal services, and benefit from the Crime Victims Fund established under President Reagan for that sole purpose.\nPublic officials must regain control of their correctional institutions, some of which have become ethnic and racial battlegrounds. Persons jailed for whatever cause should be protected against cruel or degrading treatment by other inmates. Courts should not tie the hands of prison officials in dealing with these problems. We encourage states to offer opportunities for literacy and vocational education to prepare prisoners for release to the community. Breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of those who are prisoners. Deprived of a parent through no fault of their own, youngsters from these families should be a special concern of our schools, social services, and religious institutions.\nThe internet must not become a safe haven for predators. Pornography, with its harmful effects, especially on children, has become a public health crisis that is destroying the lives of millions. We encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children's safety and well-being. We applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation. We urge energetic prosecution of child pornography, which is closely linked to human trafficking.\nCombatting Drug Abuse\nThe progress made over the last three decades against drug abuse is eroding, whether for cultural reasons or for lack of national leadership. In many jurisdictions, marijuana is virtually legalized despite its illegality under federal law. At the other end of the drug spectrum, heroin use nearly doubled from 2003 to 2013, while deaths from heroin have quadrupled. All this highlights the continuing conflicts and contradictions in public attitudes and public policy toward illegal substances. Congress and a new administration should consider the long-range implications of these trends for public health and safety and prepare to deal with the problematic consequences.\nThe misuse of prescription painkillers — opioids — is a related problem. Heroin and opioid abuse touches our communities, our homes, and our families in ways that have grave effects on Americans in every community. With a quadrupling of both their sales and their overdose deaths, the opioid crisis is ravaging communities all over the country, often hitting rural areas harder than urban. Because over-prescription of drugs is such a large part of the problem, Republican legislation now allows Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to limit patients to a single pharmacy. Congressional Republicans have also called upon the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure that no physician will be penalized for limiting opioid prescriptions. We look for expeditious agreement between the House and Senate on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which addresses the opioid epidemic from both the demand and supply sides of the problem.\nAmerica Resurgent\nA Dangerous World\nAlexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 23 that the first of the \"principal\" constitutional obligations of the federal government is to provide for the \"common defense\" of the United States, and President George Washington wisely reminded us that \"To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\"\nAfter nearly eight years of a Democratic Commander-in-Chief who has frequently placed strategic and ideological limitations and shackles on our military, our enemies have been emboldened and our national security is at great risk. Our country faces a national security crisis, and only by electing a Republican to the White House will we restore law and order to our land and safety to our citizens.\nWe are the party of peace through strength. We believe that American exceptionalism — the notion that our ideas and principles as a nation give us a unique place of moral leadership in the world — requires the United States to retake its natural position as leader of the free world.\nTyranny and injustice thrive when America is weakened. The oppressed have no greater ally than a confident and determined United States, backed by the strongest military on the planet.\nQuite simply, the Republican Party is committed to rebuilding the U.S. military into the strongest on earth, with vast superiority over any other nation or group of nations in the world. We face a dangerous world, and we believe in a resurgent America.\nIn all of our country's history, there is no parallel to what President Obama and his former Secretary of State have done to weaken our nation. Our aging naval capabilities are inadequate for their job. The Air Force fields the smallest and oldest force of combat aircraft in its history. The Marines have only two-thirds the number of battalions they have historically needed to meet day to day operational demands. The Army is at its lowest troop levels since before World War II. Our U.S. Ambassador and American personnel were left without adequate security or backup halfway across the world in Benghazi. In summary, we have returned to the hollow force days of Jimmy Carter.\nAlso neglected are our strategic forces, especially the development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system has been delayed and underfunded. To curry favor with Russia, defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic have been neutralized and the number of planned interceptors in Alaska has been reduced. A New START agreement (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), so weak in verification and definitions that it is virtually impossible to prove a violation, has allowed Russia to build up its nuclear arsenal while reducing ours. Meanwhile Moscow has repeatedly violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (a treaty agreeing to the elimination of land-based mid-range nuclear missiles) with impunity, covertly testing missiles banned under that agreement.\nIn the international arena, a weak Admini-stration has invited aggression. The results of the Administration's unilateral approach to disarmament are already clear: An emboldened China in the South China Sea, a resurgent Russia occupying parts of Ukraine and threatening neighbors from the Baltic to the Caucasus, and an aggressive Islamist terror network in the Middle East. We support maintaining and, if warranted, increasing sanctions, together with our allies, against Russia unless and until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored. We also support providing appropriate assistance to the armed forces of Ukraine and greater coordination with NATO defense planning. All our adversaries heard the message in the Administration's cutbacks: America is weaker and retreating. Concomitantly, we honor, support, and thank all law enforcement, first responders, and emergency personnel for their service.\nConfronting the Dangers\nIn the face of these threats, the first order of business for a Republican president and Congress will be to restore our nation's military might. Republicans continue to support American military superiority which has been the cornerstone of a strategy that seeks to deter aggression or defeat those who threaten our vital national security interests. We must rebuild troop numbers and readiness and confirm their mission: Protecting the nation, not nation building. The United States should meet the Reagan model of \"peace through strength\" by a force that is capable of meeting any and all threats to our vital national security. We will no longer tolerate a President whose rules of engagement put our own troops in harm's way or commanders who tell their soldiers that their first duty is to fight climate change.\nA Republican administration will begin at once to undo the damage of the last eight years. We must move from a budget-based strategy to one that puts the security of our nation first. This means that our Republican president's strategic vision will include the development of a balanced force to meet the diverse threats facing our nation. Special Operations Forces are simply not intended to deal with the full spectrum of threats. We need a Reagan-era force that can fight and win two-and one-half wars ranging from counterterrorism to deterring major power aggressors.\nWe should abandon arms control treaties that benefit our adversaries without improving our national security. We must fund, develop, and deploy a multi-layered missile defense system. We must modernize nuclear weapons and their delivery platforms, end the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and rebuild relationships with our allies, who understand that as long as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is their shield, they do not need to engage in nuclear proliferation.\nWhile immigration is addressed in more detail elsewhere, we cannot ignore the reality that border security is a national security issue, and that our nation's immigration and refugee policies are placing Americans at risk. To keep our people safe, we must secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, and properly screen refugees and other immigrants entering from any country. In particular we must apply special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States from terror-sponsoring countries or from regions associated with Islamic terrorism. This was done successfully after September 11, 2001, under the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which should be renewed now.\nSupporting Our Troops: Resources to do Their Job\nWe owe it to the American people and to those who fight our wars that we remain the strongest military on earth and be prepared to defeat any adversary under any circumstances on any battlefield, including land, air, sea, or cyber. Successive years of cuts to our defense budget have put an undue strain on our men and women in uniform. This is especially harmful at a time when we are asking our military to do more in an increasingly dangerous world. The U.S. defense budget has suffered a 25 percent cut in real dollars in the five years since sequestration. We support lifting the budget cap for defense and reject the efforts of Democrats to hold the military's budget hostage for their domestic agenda. Congress and the Administration should work together to approve military spending at the level necessary to defend our country. We must not be encumbered by decades-old, legacy procurement processes. America's incredible talent and ingenuity must be unleashed by modernizing the military procurement system and embracing competition among traditional and non-traditional suppliers. Competitive acquisition and maintenance of weapon systems, including the sustainment and support of such systems, will benefit the U.S. economy, U.S. taxpayers, and most important, the American warfighter. Increased competition will enable new Department of Defense suppliers, particularly small businesses, to participate in the defense sector. That will promote new demand for skilled-labor jobs, while making the Department's procurement more cost-efficient. The increased agility and effectiveness will ensure that our troops are equipped with the right resources more quickly than our current procurement systems allow.\nSupporting Our Troops: Standing by Our Heroes\nWith Republican leadership, the Congress recently passed legislation that begins to reverse America's military decline. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 begins to correct the shortfalls in our military readiness by reversing troop cuts, increasing investments in training and maintenance, and rebuilding facilities. It gives our troops the full pay raise to which they are entitled under the law and gives the next administration the ability to review operations and funding, make adjustments, and ask for more money if necessary. All this represents a sound start in supporting those who put their lives on the line in defense of our country, while protecting our national security in a dangerous world.\nMilitary families must be assured of the pay, healthcare, housing, education, and overall support they have earned. In recent years, they have been carrying the burden of budgetary restraint more than any other Americans through cuts in their pay, health benefits, and retirement plans. About 75 percent of enlistees come from military families. We cannot expect that level of patriotic commitment to continue among young people who have experienced the way their families have been treated.\nWe must ensure that the nation keeps its commitments to those who signed on the dotted line of enlistment. The repeated troop deployments during conflicts in the Middle East have been unusually hard on all members of their households, worsening unemployment and underemployment among spouses. In many cases, they and their children have been at war for 14 years. We must strengthen existing programs that offer families readjustment information and counseling, and we urge states to help by providing job programs, license reciprocity, one-stop service centers, and education.\nThe burden of our country's extended military involvement in the Middle East has taken a toll on our service personnel. Suicides among our military —active duty troops, reservists, National Guardsmen, and veterans — are at shocking levels, while post-service medical conditions, including addiction and mental illness, require more and more assistance. More than ever, our government must work with the private sector to advance opportunities and provide assistance to those wounded in spirit as well as in body, whether through experimental efforts like the PAWS (Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemen) program for service dogs or through the faith-based institutions that have traditionally been providers of counseling and aid.\nWe support the rights of conscience of military chaplains of all faiths to practice their faith free from political interference. We reject attempts by the Obama Administration to censure and silence them, particularly Christians and Christian chaplains. We support an increase in the size of the Chaplain Corps. A Republican commander-in-chief will protect the religious freedom of all military members, especially chaplains, and will not tolerate attempts to ban Bibles or religious symbols from military facilities. A Republican commander-in-chief will also encourage education regarding the religious liberties of military personnel under both the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the current National Defense Authorization Act.\nOur country's all-volunteer force has been a success. We oppose the reinstatement of the draft, except in dire circumstances like world war, whether directly or through compulsory national service. We support the all-volunteer force and oppose unnecessary policy changes, including compulsory national service and Selective Service registration of women for a possible future draft. We reiterate our support for both the advancement of women in the military and their exemption from direct ground combat units and infantry battalions. We affirm the cultural values that encourage selfless service and superiority in battle, and we oppose anything which might divide or weaken team cohesion, including intra-military special interest demonstrations. In particular, we warn against modification or lessening of standards in order to satisfy a non-military agenda imposed by the White House. We call for an objective review of the impact on readiness of the current Administration's ideology-based personnel policies, and will correct problems with appropriate administrative, legal, or legislative action. We reject the use of the military as a platform for social experimentation and will not accept or continue attempts to undermine military priorities and mission readiness. We believe that our nation is most secure when the president and the administration prioritize readiness, recruitment, and retention rather than using the military to advance a social or political agenda. Military readiness should not be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. We oppose legislative attempts to modify the system of military justice that would undermine its fairness and due process rights for all concerned, both the accuser and the accused.\nCitizen Soldiers: National Guard and Reserves\nOur Reserve and National Guard forces are national assets that must be nurtured in a manner commensurate with their role as America's sentinels. Their historic mission as citizen-soldiers is a proud tradition linking every town and city across America to liberty's cause. Since September 11, 2001, the National Guard has transformed from a strategic reserve to a fully integrated operational fighting force. The Guard has bled on missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and the Sinai. Today, more than fifty percent of our Guardsmen have combat experience. The Guard has demonstrated its value to the nation not only in war but during emergencies here at home such as Hurricane Katrina and Super Storm Sandy.\nTo avoid the overextension of our military, we support a larger active force and oppose the current Administration's cuts to the National Guard and Reserves. Those reductions are dangerous and counter-productive because the men and women of the Guard and Reserve tend to be older and more experienced than their active duty counterparts. \t\tGuard and Reserve forces are currently deployed at historically high rates. The Army Reserve alone has soldiers in 30 countries. To its credit, the Republican Congress, by passing the National Defense Authorization Act, has moved to ensure these troops have what they need. That provision has triggered another veto threat from the Commander-in-Chief, even though the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. He would have the members of the Reserve and Guard train on, and potentially be deployed with, equipment that is no longer used by their active duty comrades. We cannot tolerate this endangerment of both our troops and our national security. Therefore, we recommend a permanent line item for National Guard affairs, one that is not eliminated by the President and reinstated by Congress. The guard is too essential to our national defense to be a secondary decision.\nHonoring and Supporting Our Veterans: A Sacred Obligation\nOur nation's veterans have been our nation's strength and remain a national resource. Their service to their country — as community leaders, volunteers, mentors, educators, problem solvers, and public officials — continues long after they leave the military. In the same way, our obligation to the one percent who defend the other ninety-nine percent does not end when they take off the uniform. America has a sacred trust with our veterans, and we are committed to ensuring them and their families' care and dignity. The work of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is essential to meet our commitments to them: Providing health, education, disability, survivor, and home loan benefits, and arranging memorial services upon death. We heed Abraham Lincoln's command \"to care for him who bore the battle.\" To care, as well, for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, who must be assured of meaningful financial assistance, remains our solemn duty.\nAs shown by recent controversies at the Department, senior leaders must be held accountable for ensuring that their subordinates are more responsive to veterans' needs. The VA has failed those who have sacrificed the most for our freedom. The VA must move from a sometimes adversarial stance to an advocacy relationship with vets. To that end, we will empower the Secretary to hold all VA employees accountable and will seek fundamental change in the VA's senior leadership structure by placing presidential appointees, rather than careerists, in additional positions of significant responsibility. We cannot allow an unresponsive bureaucracy to blunt our national commitment. The VA must strengthen and improve its efforts through partnerships with private enterprises, veteran service organizations, technology and innovation, and competitive bidding to enable the VA to better provide both quality and timely care along with all earned benefits to our nation's veterans and their families. This will allow the VA to reduce the backlog and save immense resources all at the same time. Therefore, let us look to innovative solutions that allow higher quality VA care, reduce backlogs, and save immense resources all at the same time.\nOur wounded warriors, whether still in service or discharged, deserve the best medical care the country can provide. We must make military and veterans' medicine the gold standard for mental health, traumatic brain injury, multiple traumas, loss of limbs, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Those injuries require a new commitment of targeted resources and personnel for treatment and care to advance recovery. That includes allowing veterans to choose to access care in the community and not just in VA facilities, because the best care in the world is not effective if it is not accessible. We will seek to consolidate the VA's existing community care authorities to make a single program that will be easily understood by both veterans and VA healthcare providers.\nLike the rest of American medicine, the VA faces a critical shortage of primary care and mental health physicians. That's why there are long waiting times to see a doctor and why doctors are often frustrated by the limited time they have with their patients. This is especially the case with mental health care, which often amounts to prescribing drugs because there are not enough psychologists and psychiatrists to do anything else. Inadequate treatment of PTSD drives other problems like suicide, homelessness, and unemployment. This situation may not be quickly reversed, but a Republican administration will begin, on day one, to undertake the job.\nAs a nation, we honor the sacrifice of our fallen service members at the graves where we lay them to rest in national, state, and veterans' cemeteries around the world. In doing so, we make it clear that their ultimate sacrifice and service to our country will never be forgotten. As a party, we seek to honor their sacrifice and comfort their families by ensuring all veterans' cemeteries are adequately equipped and a standard of care established, using Arlington Cemetery as a guide, that is befitting their service.\nThe level of financial distress and homeless-ness among vets is a shame to the nation. For a veteran, a job is more than a source of income. It is a new mission, with a new status, and the transition can be difficult. We urge the private sector to make hiring vets a company policy and commend the organizations that have proven programs to accomplish this. We will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment. We urge closer coordination with the state offices for veterans' affairs, particularly with regard to expediting disability claims, since those closest to an individual can often best diagnose a problem and apply a remedy. We will halt the current Administration's unconstitutional automatic denial of gun ownership to returning members of our Armed Forces who have had representatives appointed to manage their financial affairs. We urge state education officials to promote the hiring of qualified veterans as teachers in our public schools. Their proven abilities and life experiences will make them more successful instructors and role models for students than would any teaching certification.\nOver-prescription of opioids has become a nationwide problem hindering the treatment of veterans suffering from mental health issues. We therefore support the need to explore new and broader ranges of options, including faith-based programs, that will better serve the veteran and reduce the need to rely on drugs as the sole treatment.\nAmerica: The Indispensable Nation\nFor the last several generations, our country's two major political parties were dedicated to the nation's security and the advance of freedom around the world. Both had learned from mistakes of the past and realized that a weak America invited aggression. Both recognized the need to stand with friends and oppose those who wished us evil. Whatever their disagreements, both the Republican and Democratic parties stood for peace through strength — and strength meant American military superiority.\nThis bipartisan commitment has tragically changed. The leadership of the Democratic Party, both those in office and those who seek it, no longer see America as a force for good in the world. They do not stand by allies or stand strong against our foes. They pander to world opinion and neglect the national interest. They cannot be trusted to advance either the cause of liberty or our national security in the dangerous years in which we live.\nWe affirm our party's tradition of world leadership established by President Eisenhower and followed by every Republican president since. It stands for enormous power — and the prudence to use it sparingly, precisely, and only in grave necessity. It stands for involvement, not intervention. It requires consultation, not permission to act. It leads from the front — and ensures all others do their parts as well. It embraces American exceptionalism and rejects the false prophets of decline and diminution. It is, in sum, the way we will lead the world into a new century of greater peace and prosperity — another American Century.\nChallenges of a Changing Middle East\nThe Middle East is more dangerous now than at any time since the Second World War. Whatever their disagreements, presidents of both parties had always prioritized America's national interests, the trust of friendly governments, and the security of Israel. That sound consensus was replaced with impotent grandstanding on the part of the current President and his Secretaries of State. The results have been ruinous for all parties except Islamic terrorists and their Iranian and other sponsors.\nWe consider the Administration's deal with Iran, to lift international sanctions and make hundreds of billions of dollars available to the Mullahs, a personal agreement between the President and his negotiating partners and non-binding on the next president. Without a two-thirds endorsement by the Senate, it does not have treaty status. Because of it, the defiant and emboldened regime in Tehran continues to sponsor terrorism across the region, develop a nuclear weapon, test-fire ballistic missiles inscribed with \"Death to Israel,\" and abuse the basic human rights of its citizens. A Republican president will not be bound by it. We must retain all options in dealing with a situation that gravely threatens our security, our interests, and the survival of our friends.\nOver the last four years we have seen the rise of a murderous fanaticism in the form of ISIS, the so called Islamic State. Its reach now extends far beyond the Middle East to virtually every continent. ISIS has brought ancient butchery into the 21st century. Nations are imploding, erasing long-established borders. The Obama Administration and its Secretary of State so mishandled the Arab Spring that it destabilized the entire region. The hope some saw in the Arab Spring has transformed into disappointment. The dictator of Syria, Bashar Assad, has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people and created millions of refugees, and an American president has been unable to rally the world against him. Understandably, our allies fear for their future in a region far more dangerous than it was eight years ago.\nA Republican administration will restore our nation's credibility. We must stand up for our friends, challenge our foes, and destroy ISIS. Hezbollah, controlling over 100,000 missiles in Lebanon, must be isolated and Lebanon's independence restored. We will support the transition to a post-Assad Syrian government that is representative of its people, protects the rights of all minorities and religions, respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, and contributes to peace and stability in the region. The Iraqi people have been on the front lines in the fight against terror. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, and the attacks against them continue, even in Baghdad. Our partnership with them should continue as long as ISIS and others like it survive in the region. We are deeply concerned that, in the face of genocide against them, Christian communities in cities like Erbil are receiving no financial support from either the U.S. government or the UN to help with displaced persons and urban refugees. Their survival is sustained only by private charities. This must change immediately. Defeating ISIS means more than pushing back its fighters while abandoning its victims. It must mean aiding those who have suffered the most — and doing so before they starve. It means supporting the long-term survival of indigenous religious and ethnic communities, punishing the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, and conditioning humanitarian and military assistance to governments on their observable commitment to human rights.\nWe continue to support the Kurdish people, whose bravery and cooperation with our forces merit our respect and their autonomy. Many countries in the region have given, and continue to give, substantial assistance to the United States because they understand that our struggle against terrorism is not an ethnic or religious fight. They consider violent extremists to be abusers of their faith, not its champions. We applaud their courage and value their counsel. The U.S. government, together with its global partners, should mobilize its political, economic, and military assets to support the creation of a safe haven in northern Iraq to protect those ethnic and religious minorities continuing to face genocide at the hands of ISIS.\nOur Unequivocal Support for Israel\nLike the United States of America, the modern state of Israel is a country born from the aspiration for freedom and stands out among the nations as a beacon of democracy and humanity. Beyond our mutual strategic interests, Israel is likewise an exceptional country that shares our most essential values. It is the only country in the Middle East where freedom of speech and freedom of religion are found. Therefore, support for Israel is an expression of Americanism, and it is the responsibility of our government to advance policies that reflect Americans' strong desire for a relationship with no daylight between America and Israel. We recognize Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the Jewish state and call for the American embassy to be moved there in fulfillment of U.S. law.\nWe reaffirm America's commitment to Israel's security and will ensure that Israel maintains a qualitative military edge over any and all adversaries. We support Israel's right and obligation to defend itself against terror attacks upon its people and against alternative forms of warfare being waged upon it legally, economically, culturally, and otherwise. We reject the false notion that Israel is an occupier and specifically recognize that the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement (BDS) is anti-Semitic in nature and seeks to destroy Israel. Therefore, we call for effective legislation to thwart actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with Israel, or persons or entities doing business in Israel or in Israeli-controlled territories, in a discriminatory manner.\nThe United States seeks to assist in the establishment of comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, to be negotiated among those living in the region. We oppose any measures intended to impose an agreement or to dictate borders or other terms, and we call for the immediate termination of all U.S. funding of any entity that attempts to do so. Our party is proud to stand with Israel now and always.\nU.S. Leadership in the Asian Pacific\nWe are a Pacific nation with economic, military, and cultural ties to all the countries of the oceanic rim and treaty alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand. With them, we look toward the establishment of human rights for the people of North Korea. We urge the government of China to recognize the inevitability of change in the Kim family's slave state and, for everyone's safety against nuclear disaster, to hasten positive change on the Korean peninsula. The United States will continue to demand the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons program with full accounting of its proliferation activities. We also pledge to counter any threats from the North Korean regime.\nWe salute the people of Taiwan, with whom we share the values of democracy, human rights, a free market economy, and the rule of law. Our relations will continue to be based upon the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act, and we affirm the Six Assurances given to Taiwan in 1982 by President Reagan. We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island's future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan. If China were to violate those principles, the United States, in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act, will help Taiwan defend itself. We praise efforts by the new government in Taipei to continue constructive relations across the Taiwan Strait and call on China to reciprocate. As a loyal friend of America, Taiwan has merited our strong support, including free trade agreement status, the timely sale of defensive arms including technology to build diesel submarines, and full participation in the World Health Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, and other multilateral institutions.\nChina's behavior has negated the optimistic language of our last platform concerning our future relations with China. The liberalizing policies of recent decades have been abruptly reversed, dissent brutally crushed, religious persecution heightened, the internet crippled, a barbaric population control two-child policy of forced abortions and forced sterilizations continued, and the cult of Mao revived. Critics of the regime have been kidnapped by its agents in foreign countries. To distract the populace from its increasing economic problems and, more importantly, to expand its military might, the government asserts a preposterous claim to the entire South China Sea and continues to dredge ports and create landing fields in contested waters where none have existed before, ever nearer to U.S. territories and our allies, while building a navy far out of proportion to defensive purposes. The complacency of the Obama regime has emboldened the Chinese government and military to issue threats of intimidation throughout the South China Sea, not to mention parading their new missile, \"the Guam Killer,\" down the main streets of Beijing, a direct shot at Guam as America's first line of defense. Meanwhile, cultural genocide continues in Tibet and Xinjiang, the promised autonomy of Hong Kong is eroded, the currency is manipulated, our technology is stolen, and intellectual property and copyrights are mocked in an economy based on piracy. In business terms, this is not competition; it is a hostile takeover. For any American company to abet those offenses, especially governmental censorship and tracking of dissenters, is a disgrace.\nThe return to Maoism by China's current rulers is not reason to disengage with the Chinese people or their institutions. We welcome students, tourists, and investors, who can see for themselves our vibrant American democracy and how real democracy works. We caution, however, against academic or cultural operations under the control of the Chinese government and call upon American colleges to dissociate themselves from this increasing threat to academic freedom and honest research.\nMost of the nations of Southeast Asia have set aside crippling ideologies and sought material progress in free enterprise and democracy. We congratulate the people of Burma on their emergence from authoritarian rule and urge their respect for the rights of their country's minority populations. Our improved relations with Vietnam — including arms sales — must advance efforts to obtain an accounting for, and repatriation of the remains of, Americans who gave their lives in the cause of Vietnamese freedom. We cannot overlook the continued repression of fundamental rights and religious freedom, as well as retribution against ethnic minorities and others who assisted U.S. forces during the conflict there.\nIndia is our geopolitical ally and a strategic trading partner. The dynamism of its people and the endurance of their democratic institutions are earning their country a position of leadership not only in Asia but throughout the world. We encourage the Indian government to permit expanded foreign investment and trade, the key to rising living standards for those left out of their country's energetic economy. For all of India's religious communities, we urge protection against violence and discrimination. Republicans note with pride the contributions to our country that are made by our fellow citizens of Indian ancestry.\nConflicts in the Middle East have created special political and military challenges for the people of Pakistan. Our working relationship is a necessary, though sometimes difficult, benefit to both, and we look toward the strengthening of historic ties that have frayed under the weight of international conflict. This process cannot progress as long as any citizen of Pakistan can be punished for helping the War on Terror. Pakistanis, Afghans, and Americans have a common interest in ridding the region of the Taliban and securing Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. That goal has been undermined by the current Administration's feckless treatment of troop commitments and blatant disregard of advice from commanders on the ground, particularly with regard to Afghanistan. A Republican president will work with all regional leaders to restore mutual trust while insisting upon progress against corruption and the narcotic trade that fuels insurgency.\nRenewing the European Alliance\nWith bipartisan support, President Truman forged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as an alliance of the western democracies. Its continued effectiveness is vital, especially in light of recent military challenges in Eastern Europe. With the American people spending on defense, per capita, four times the amount spent by Europeans, we demand, as we have in the past, that our fellow members of NATO fulfill their commitments and meet their need for greater investment in their armed forces.\nOur historic ties to the peoples of Europe have been based on shared culture and values, common interests and goals. Their endurance cannot be taken for granted, especially in light of the continent's economic problems and demographic changes. We recognize with regret the increasing trend among many of our allies to move away from rights and liberties that Americans hold dear, especially freedom of speech. It would be a tragic irony if the nations of Europe which withstood Soviet repression were to now impose a form of it upon themselves.\nWe honor our special relationship with the people of the United Kingdom and are grateful for their staunch support in the fight against terrorism. We respect their decision concerning their nation's relationship to the European Union and pledge that, however much other international relationships may change, those who were first to our side in our hour of loss will always rank first in our policies and our esteem.\nWe thank the several nations of Europe that have contributed to a united effort in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Their support and sacrifice in the fight against Islamic terrorism will not be forgotten. We applaud the ongoing reconciliation in Northern Ireland and hope that its success might be replicated in Cyprus. We urge greater coordination in economic and security affairs between the United States and the republics of Eastern Europe. We urge that Poland be granted visa waiver status and we support placement of NATO troops in Poland.\nFor the people of Russia, we affirm our respect and our determination to maintain a friendship beyond the reach of those who wish to divide us. We have common imperatives: Ending terrorism, combating nuclear proliferation, promoting trade, and more. We also have a common problem: The continuing erosion of personal liberty and fundamental rights under the current officials in the Kremlin. Repressive at home and reckless abroad, their policies imperil the nations which regained their self-determination upon the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will meet the return of Russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will not accept any territorial change in Eastern Europe imposed by force, in Ukraine, Georgia, or elsewhere, and will use all appropriate constitutional measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination.\nWe urge greater attention in U.S. diplomacy, trade, and strategic planning, to the nations of Eurasia, formerly parts of the Soviet Empire. Caught between their two authoritarian neighbors, their path toward democratic institutions has been uncertain. We urge our government and our allies to work toward the integration of the Central Asian republics into the global economy through foreign investment, which can bring with it market and political reforms and a firmer establishment of the rule of law. Those developments will not only improve the living conditions throughout that vast area but are likely to reduce the lure of the radical ideologies that already threaten the region.\nFamily of the Americas\nOur future is intimately tied to the future of the Americas. Family, language, culture, environment, and trade link us closely with both Canada and Mexico. Our relations with both of these friends will be based upon continuing cooperation and our mutually shared interests. Our attention to trade and environmental issues will contribute to strong economic growth and prosperity throughout the Americas.\nWe thank our neighbors in Mexico and Canada who have been our partners in the fight against terrorism and the war on drugs. The Mexican people deserve our assistance as they bravely resist the drug cartels that traffic in death on both sides of our border. Their rich cultural and religious heritage, shared by many millions of our fellow citizens, should foster greater understanding and cooperation between our countries.\nOur Canadian neighbors can count on our cooperation and respect. To advance North America's energy independence, we intend to reverse the current Administration's blocking of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Apart from its economic value, that project has become a symbol in the contest between the public's desire for economic development and the government's hostility to growth. We stand with the people.\nWe express our solidarity with all the peoples of the Western Hemisphere. Their aspirations for economic betterment and political liberty have deserved better from our government than its policies of the last eight years. The current Administration has abandoned America's friends and rewarded its enemies. A Republican president will never embrace a Marxist dictator, in Venezuela or anywhere else. The current chief executive has allowed that country to become a narco-terrorist state, an Iranian outpost threatening Central America, and a safe haven for the agents of Hezbollah. Now, with their country ruined by socialism and on the verge of chaos, the Venezuelan people are fighting to restore their democracy and regain their rights. When they triumph, as they surely will, the United States will stand ready to help them restore their country to the family of the Americas.\nWe affirm our friendship and admiration for the people of Colombia and call on the Republican Congress to express its solidarity with their decades-long fight against the terrorist FARC. Their sacrifice and suffering must not be betrayed by the accession to power of murderers and drug lords.\nWe want to welcome the people of Cuba back into our hemispheric family — after their corrupt rulers are forced from power and brought to account for their crimes against humanity. We stand with the Women in White and all the victims of the loathsome regime that clings to power in Havana. We do not say this lightly: They have been betrayed by those who are currently in control of U.S. foreign policy. The current Administration's \"opening to Cuba\" was a shameful accommodation to the demands of its tyrants. It will only strengthen their military dictatorship. We call on the Congress to uphold current U.S. law which sets conditions for the lifting of sanctions on the island: Legalization of political parties, an independent media, and free and fair internationally-supervised elections. We call for a dedicated platform for the transmission of Radio and TV Martí and for the promotion of internet access and circumvention technology as tools to strength Cuba's pro-democracy movement. We support the work of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba and affirm the principles of the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, recognizing the rights of Cubans fleeing Communism.\nAfrica: The Promise and the Challenge\nWe recognize Africa's extraordinary potential. Both the United States and our many African allies will become stronger through investment, trade, and promotion of the democratic and free market principles that have brought prosperity around the world. We pledge to be the best partner of all African nations in their pursuit of economic freedom and human rights. The Republican Congress has extended to 2025 the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and President George W. Bush's health initiatives — AIDS relief under PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria — continue to save millions of lives. Peace Corps volunteers and U.S. Seabees teach and build in villages that know firsthand our country's idealism.\nWe stand in solidarity with those African countries now under assault by the forces of radical Islam: Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, and others like them. Their terror falls on both Muslims and Christians, on anyone who will not submit to their savage ideology. We urge governments throughout the continent to recognize this threat to their own people. We support closer cooperation in both military and economic matters with those on the front lines of civilization's battle against the forces of evil.\nSovereign American Leadership in International Organizations\nThere is no substitute for principled American leadership. Since the end of World War II, the United States, through the founding of the United Nations and NATO, has participated in a number of international organizations which can, but sometimes do not, serve the cause of peace and prosperity. While acting through them our country must always reserve the right to go its own way. We must not be silent about our country's cause. That is why we have long supported our country's international broadcasting to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\nOur continued participation in the United Nations should be contingent upon the enactment of long-overdue changes in the way that institution functions. American taxpayers, the chief funders of the U.N., deserve full transparency in the financial operations of its overpaid bureaucrats. We should no longer tolerate its managerial scandals, its Human Rights Council composed of some of the world's worst tyrants, and its treatment of Israel as a pariah state. The U.N.'s Population Fund has, from its origin, been rooted in no-growth policies that limit economic development in the countries needing it most. Its complicity in China's barbaric program of forced abortion led President Reagan to set a wall of separation — his Mexico City Policy, which prohibits the granting of federal monies to non-governmental organizations that provide or promote abortion. We affirm his position and, in light of plummeting birth rates around the world, suggest a reevaluation of the U.N.'s record on economic progress.\nPrecisely because we take our country's treaty obligations seriously, we oppose ratification of international agreements whose long-range implications are ominous or unclear. We do not support the U.N. Convention on Women's Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, as well as various declarations from the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development. Because of our concern for American sovereignty, domestic management of our fisheries, and our country's long-term energy needs, we have deep reservations about the regulatory, legal, and tax regimes inherent in the Law of the Sea Treaty. We emphatically reject U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of U.S. sovereignty, and we oppose any form of Global Tax.\nTo shield members of our Armed Forces and others in service to America from ideological prosecutions overseas, the Republican Party does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. We support statutory protection for U.S. personnel and officials as they act abroad to meet our global security requirements, and we deplore the current inaction of the Administration in that regard. Our service members must be subject only to American law.\nDefending International Religious Freedom\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an initiative of Congressional Republicans, has been neglected by the current Administration at a time when its voice more than ever needs to be heard. Religious minorities across the Middle East have been driven from their ancient homelands, and thousands, there and in Africa, have been slaughtered for their faith in what the State Department has, belatedly, labeled genocide. The United States must stand with leaders, like President Sisi of Egypt who has bravely protected the rights of Coptic Christians in Egypt, and call on other leaders across the region to ensure that all religious minorities, whether Yazidi, Bahai, Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant Christians, are free to practice their religion without fear of persecution. At a time when China has renewed its destruction of churches, Christian home-schooling parents are jailed in parts of Europe, and even Canada threatens pastors for their preaching, a Republican administration will return the advocacy of religious liberty to a central place in its diplomacy, will quickly designate the systematic killing of religious and ethnic minorities a genocide, and will work with the leaders of other nations to condemn and combat genocidal acts.\nAmerica's Generosity: International Assistance that Makes a Difference\nForeign aid must serve America's interests first. In today's world of complex challenges, international assistance is a critical tool for advancing America's security and economic interests by preventing conflict, building stability, opening markets for private investment, and responding to suffering and need with the compassion that is at the heart of our country's values. A strong commitment to international development and diplomacy, alongside defense, was a key component of President Reagan's \"peace through strength\" strategy. It can sometimes serve as an alternative means of keeping the peace, far less costly both in dollars and in human lives than military engagement. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, spearheaded by the last Republican Administration, has established a new model of foreign assistance that helps ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on projects that are effective, results-driven, transparent, and accountable. We must embrace this model throughout our foreign assistance programs and efforts as a catalyst for private sector investment to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and open new markets for American goods and services in a competitive global economy. Foreign assistance programs must not only project the best of American values, but must work to create self-sustainability and leverage the resources and capacity of the private sector. Even more important is the overseas assistance —billions of dollars and volunteer hours — provided by America's foundations, educational institutions, faith-based groups, and charitable individuals. Their essential role in international development should be weighed in any revision of the tax code.\nThe advance of political freedom and entrepreneurial capitalism drives economic growth, catalyzes private sector development, and is the only sustainable solution to poverty. Over the last 50 years, the level of private investment overseas from the United States has eclipsed aid many times over. Our development strategy must build on recent Republican efforts to use foreign assistance to catalyze private sector investment and expertise in addressing global challenges that can build a more stable world and advance America's national security and economic interests.\nThe integrity of our country's foreign assistance program has been compromised by the current Administration's attempt to impose on foreign recipients, especially the peoples of Africa, its own radical social agenda while excluding faith-based groups — the sector with the best track record in promoting development — because they will not conform to that agenda. We pledge to reverse this course, encouraging more involvement by the most effective aid organizations and trusting developing peoples to build their futures through their own values.\nAdvancing Human Rights\nTo those who stand in the darkness of tyranny, America has always been a beacon of hope, and so it must remain. Radical Islamic terrorism poses an existential threat to personal freedom and peace around the world. We oppose its brutal assault on all human beings, all of whom have inherent dignity. The Republican Party stands united with all victims of terrorism and will fight at home and abroad to destroy terrorist organizations and protect the lives and fundamental liberties of all people. Republicans have led the way in promoting initiatives that have protected and rescued millions of the world's most vulnerable and persecuted. Standing up for repressed religious groups, prisoners of conscience, women trafficked into sexual slavery, and those suffering from disease or starvation is not just consistent with American values. It advances important security and economic interests as well. A Republican administration will never say, as Hillary Clinton did as Secretary of State in 2009, that raising human rights concerns \"can't interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security crisis.\"\nThe United States needs a radical rethinking of our human rights diplomacy. A Republican administration will adopt a \"whole of government\" approach to protect fundamental freedoms globally, one where pressing human rights and rule of law issues are integrated at every appropriate level of our bilateral relationships and strategic decision-making. Republican policy will reflect the fact that the health of the U.S. economy and environment, the safety of our food and drug supplies, the security of our investments and personal information in cyberspace, and the stability and security of the oceans will increasingly depend on allowing the free flow of news and information and developing an independent judiciary and civil society in countries with repressive governments such as China, Russia, and many nations in the Middle East and Africa.\nLiberty to Captives: Combatting Human Trafficking\nAs an estimated 21 million people worldwide are trapped in modern day slavery, we are reminded to be vigilant against human trafficking in whatever form it appears. We will use the full force of the law against those who engage in commercial sexual exploitation and forced or bonded labor of men, women, or children; involuntary domestic servitude; trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal; and the illegal recruitment and use of child soldiers. Building on the accomplishments of the last Republican administration in implementing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, we call for increased diplomatic efforts and accountability for foreign governments to prosecute traffickers, including penalties for any public officials who may be complicit in this devastating crime. We will highlight the need to stop slave labor, taking steps to prevent overseas labor contractors who exploit foreign workers from supporting military bases abroad or exporting goods to the United States. A Republican administration will strategize with partners around the world to prevent the demand for trafficking victims that makes exploitation lucrative and will prosecute sex tourists and domestic buyers to the fullest extent of the law. We will work at home and abroad to ensure that trafficking victims are identified among migrants, refugees, and our own citizens so they receive the rehabilitative care needed to heal and thrive.\nAmerica's continuing participation in the international campaign against human trafficking merits our support. The goal of our domestic anti-trafficking programs should be the rescue and safe return of victims to their homes, not creating a long-term dependency upon public support. We call for greater scrutiny of overseas labor contractors to prevent abuses against temporary foreign workers brought to the United States. The horrific deaths of smuggled workers on our southwestern border at the hands of drug cartels and other gangs highlight the need for total security in that region.\nFacing 21st Century Threats:\nCybersecurity in an Insecure World\nCyber attacks against our businesses, institutions, and the government itself have become almost routine. They will continue until the world understands that an attack will not be tolerated — that we are prepared to respond in kind and in greater magnitude. Despite their promises to the contrary, Russia and China see cyber operations as a part of a warfare strategy during peacetime. Our response should be to cause diplomatic, financial, and legal pain, curtailing visas for guilty parties, freezing their assets, and pursuing criminal actions against them. We should seek to weaken control over the internet by regimes that engage in cyber crimes. We must stop playing defense and go on offense to avoid the cyber-equivalent of Pearl Harbor.\nThe Republican Congress has passed important legislation to advance information-sharing among entities endangered by cyber attacks. We will explore the possibility of a free market for Cyber-Insurance and make clear that users have a self-defense right to deal with hackers as they see fit. It is critical that we protect the cyber supply chain to ensure against contamination of components made all over the world, sometimes in offending countries. Our own cyber workforce should be expanded with the assistance of the military, business, and hacker communities to better protect our country.\nProtection Against an Electromagnetic Pulse\nA single nuclear weapon detonated at high altitude over this country would collapse our electrical grid and other critical infrastructures and endanger the lives of millions. With North Korea in possession of nuclear missiles and Iran close to having them, an EMP is no longer a theoretical concern — it is a real threat. Moreover, China and Russia include sabotage as part of their warfare planning. Nonetheless, hundreds of electrical utilities in the United States have not acted to protect themselves from EMP, and they cannot be expected to do so voluntarily since homeland security is a government responsibility. The President, the Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the States, the utilities, and the private sector should work together on an urgent basis to enact Republican legislation, pending in both chambers, to protect the national grid and encourage states to take the initiative to protect their own grids expeditiously.\nConfronting Internet Tyranny\nInternet firewall circumvention and anti-censorship technology must become a national priority in light of the way authoritarian governments such as China, Cuba, and Iran restrict free press and isolate their people limiting political, cultural, and religious freedom. Leaders of authoritarian governments argue that governments have the same legal right to control internet access as they do to control migrant access. A focus on internet freedom is a cost-effective means of peacefully advancing fundamental freedoms in closed and authoritarian societies. But it is also an important economic interest, as censorship constitutes a trade barrier for U.S. companies operating in societies like China with advanced firewall protection policies.\nA Republican administration will champion an open and free internet based on principles of free expression and universal values and will pursue policies to empower citizens and U.S. companies operating in authoritarian countries to circumvent internet firewalls and gain accurate news and information online.\nThe Platform Committee Republican National Committee Chairman\nReince Priebus\nChairman\nSenator John Barrasso\nCo-Chairs\nGovernor Mary Fallin\nRepresentative Virginia Foxx\nSubcommittee Co-Chairs\nRestoring the American Dream\nJoe Gruters\nDelbert Hosemann\nAndy Puzder\nA Rebirth of Constitutional Government\nRayna Casey\nKathy Kiernan\nLeslie Rutledge\nAmerica's Natural Resources: Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment\nKelly Armstrong\nVictor Sprouse\nGovernment Reform\nTom Schriebel\nRuss Walker\nGreat American Families, Education, Healthcare, and Criminal Justice\nCarolyn McLarty\nPatricia Longo\nAmerica Resurgent\nJim Carns\nRon Rabin\nSteve Yates\nCommittee Members\nALABAMA\nJim Carns\nJudy Carns\nALASKA\nJim Crawford\nJudy Eledge\nAMERICAN SAMOA\nBrandon Smart\nARIZONA\nAndrea Kadar\nLynden (Len) Munsil\nARKANSAS\nJohn Nabholz\nLeslie Rutledge\nCALIFORNIA\nNoel Hentschel\nAndy Puzder\nCOLORADO\nRobin Coran\nJustin Everett\nCONNECTICUT\nAnthony D'Amelio\nPatricia Longo\nDELAWARE\nAllison Brokaw\nTimothy Houseal\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nRachel Hoff\nChip Nottingham\nFLORIDA\nCindy Graves\nJoe Gruters\nGEORGIA\nRanya Casey\nCurtis \"Scott\" Johnson\nGUAM\nJuan Carlos Benitez\nMargaret Metcalfe\nHAWAII\nAdrienne King\nWilliam McClary\nIDAHO\nVicki Keen\nSteve Yates\nILLINOIS\nStephanie Holderfield\nJohn Lynch\nINDIANA\nJames Bopp\nBrenda Goff\nIOWA\nBen Barringer\nTamara Scott\nKANSAS\nMary Kay Culp\nKris Kobach\nKENTUCKY\nJulie Adams\nNathan Haney\nLOUISIANA\nSandra (Sandy) McDade\nTony Perkins\nMAINE\nEric Brakey\nStacey Guerin\nMARYLAND\nJoeylynn Hough\nMichael (Ben) Marchi\nMASSACHUSETTS\nAmy Carnevale\nBob Maginn\nMICHIGAN\nJoe Hune\nMeshawn Maddock\nMINNESOTA\nAndy Aplikowski\nJanet Beihoffer\nMISSISSIPPI\nLynn Fitch\nDelbert Hosemann\nMISSOURI\nHardy Billington\nBev Ehlen\nMONTANA\nSeth Berglee\nDebra Lamm\nNEBRASKA\nDebby Brehm\nBrian Buescher\nNEVADA\nJuanita Cox\nJesse Law\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\nJuliana Bergeron\nStephen Stepanek\nNEW JERSEY\nJoseph Pennacchio\nJill Space\nNEW MEXICO\nJonathan Gardner\nAndrea Moore\nNEW YORK\nThomas Dadey\nAnne Dickerson\nNORTH CAROLINA\nMary Forrester\nRon Rabin\nNORTH DAKOTA\nKelly Armstrong\nKelly Schmidt\nNORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS\nIvan Blanco\nOHIO\nDavid Johnson\nTracey Monroe-Winbush\nOKLAHOMA\nMarc Hader\nCarolyn McLarty\nOREGON\nDonna Cain\nRuss Walker\nPENNSYLVANIA\nJim McErlane\nCarol Sides\nPUERTO RICO\nJenniffer González-Colón\nJorge San Miguel\nRHODE ISLAND\nGiovanni Cicione\nLee Ann Sennick\nSOUTH CAROLINA\nAlan Clemmons\nLaDonna Ryggs\nSOUTH DAKOTA\nNancy Neff\nHal Wick\nTENNESSEE\nVictor Ashe\nConnie Hunter\nTEXAS\nDavid Barton\nDiana Denman\nUTAH\nBoyd Matheson\nGayle Ruzicka\nVERMONT\nRick Cochran\nDarcie Johnston\nVIRGINIA\nCynthia Dunbar\nThomas Valentine\nVIRGIN ISLANDS\nApril Newland\nHumberto O'Neal\nWASHINGTON\nManette Merrill\nPhilip Wilson\nWEST VIRGINIA\nMelody Potter\nVictor Sprouse\nWISCONSIN\nKathy Kiernan\nTom Schreibel\nWYOMING\nMarti Halverson\nDick Shanor\nPlatform Staff\nBen Key, Executive Director\nAndrew Bremberg, Policy Director\nBill Gribbin, Editor\nEric Ueland, Assistant Editor\nMary Salvi, Executive Assistant\nDavid Schiappa, Parliamentarian\nJustin Riemer, Counsel\nMary Elizabeth Taylor, Clerk\nAllison Curry, Clerk\nSloane Skinner, Clerk\nKaren Portik, Graphic Designer\nMarcia Brown, Production\nSheila Berkley, Platform Consultant\nMike Mears, Director of Strategic Partnerships\nRachel Packebush, Intern\nAdministrative Team\nBrian O'Malley, Ed Cowling, Blake Glovitz, Kim Owens, Will Gillette, Gordon James\nCourt Reporter\nStephen Mengelkamp, Nate Riveness\nPolicy Staff\nRestoring the American Dream\nJeff Schlagenhauf\nEric Ueland\nA Rebirth of Constitutional Government\nStephen Higgins\nRobert Porter\nAmerica's Natural Resources: Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment\nBrian Clifford\nJustin Memmott\nGovernment Reform\nDanielle Cutrona\nKaty Talento\nGreat American Families, Education, Healthcare, and Criminal Justice\nKatie Altshuler\nCyrus Artz\nAmerica Resurgent\nJonathan Burks\nMichael Stransky\nRobert Wilkie\nFormer Executive Directors\nAmbassador John Bolton, 1984;

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117926", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:05 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any comments to make at the top. We can go straight to your questions. Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. With the attempted coup in Turkey and crackdown on thousands of those said to be part of the coup, can you say whether Turkey's membership in NATO is secure -- whether it's not in jeopardy? And is the White House worried that this turmoil is harming the war on the Islamic State group?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, the United States strongly values the important relationship that we have with our NATO ally, Turkey. That's why you saw such forceful condemnation from U.S. officials of the failed coup in Turkey over the weekend. The United States strongly supports Turkey's democratically elected civilian government and that country's democratic institutions. That is support that's been conveyed to Turkish officials at a variety of levels, and I would anticipate that relatively soon the President will have an opportunity to convey those views directly to his Turkish counterpart. We will let you know when that's happened.\nI also saw earlier today that the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, had an opportunity to talk to President Erdogan today as well to reiterate our alliance's support for that country's democratic institutions.\nWhat we have also regularly done -- and will continue to do this moving forward as well -- is, even in the face of these very difficult circumstances, reiterate our view that it's critically important that all parties show restraint, act within the rule of law, and avoid actions that could lead to additional instability or violence. That's an important priority and one that we'll continue to reiterate both publicly and privately in the days ahead.\nQ: You used the word \"restraint.\" Is that something that the Turkish government is using now as it arrests thousands in response to the attempt itself? Are the actions measured responsible in the eyes of the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to pass judgment from here. I think you could imagine that if the United States government is concerned about the failed coup in Turkey, you could imagine that the democratically elected government of Turkey might be quite concerned about the failed coup. So their concern is understandable. What the United States has offered to do is to assist where possible in the investigation of what transpired over the weekend. But again, what we've made clear many times and what U.S. officials will continue to make clear to their Turkish counterparts is that it's critical for them to exercise restraint, to respect and observe due process, and to protect the freedoms that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution.\nQ: The President spent a lot of time and effort last week trying to unite law enforcement, elected officials, community activists, meetings here at the White House, his travels to Dallas. And then we had yesterday's shooting in Baton Rouge. So I guess at least my question -- we've had a lot of discussions and meetings over the past week. Are there any concrete actions that the administration will be taking in the next week or two that could help police departments? And is the President thinking about going to Baton Rouge, or is it too soon for to know that at this stage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take your last question first. Obviously officials in Baton Rouge are still in the midst of an investigation to learn as much as possible about the circumstances of the tragic incident that resulted in the unjustified killing of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge. I'm not aware of any plans for a memorial service that surely that community will organize, so I don't have any updates of the President's schedule at this point to share.\nYou heard the President speak from this podium almost 24 hours ago, where he conveyed his condolences to the people of Baton Rouge. He reiterated his unwavering support for police officers across the country, the vast majority of whom are men and women who put on the uniform and walk out the door of their home every single day prepared to put their lives on the line to protect their fellow citizens. And unfortunately, yesterday morning in Baton Rouge, three of those police officers had to give their lives.\nThe President spoke to both Governor Edwards and Mayor Holden yesterday. The President also had an opportunity to visit with his Attorney General yesterday. The President has asked the Attorney General to come back tomorrow and give him a briefing on the situation. So we'll have more details on that meeting hopefully before the end of the day today, but that I think should be an indication to you that the situation is closely on -- is at the forefront of the President's mind right now.\nOver the course of the last week, we have been talking a lot about what more we could do to support our police officers. And when the President was at NATO, he had an opportunity to talk publicly about some of the things that he believes we can do as a government and as a society to show more support for our men and women in law enforcement. And that includes providing additional resources for training and equipment. It means looking for ways to provide additional resources even through the federal government to increase staffing levels at law enforcement agencies. We know that there are a lot of organizations that are strained because they don't have as many officers as they would like to do the important work that they have to do.\nWe've certainly talked about the President's support for collective bargaining rights. Certainly strengthening the ability of law enforcement officers to negotiate with local governments for things like better pay and better benefits, and more time off would certainly make their jobs a little bit easier. And the President has also talked about steps we could take as it relates to gun safety that could make the job, the very difficult job that men and women in law enforcement do every day just a little bit easier and just a little bit safer. And the President is going to continue to be outspoken about that as well.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, to follow up on Turkey. Turkey has says that it will reconsider its friendship with the United States if the U.S. does not extradite a Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania who it blames for the coup. The Prime Minister even said on Saturday that any country that stands by Mr. Gulen will be considered not a friend of Turkey, but at war with them. What's your reaction to that? And how will this proceed with regard to this cleric?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I know that Secretary Kerry was asked about some of these comments yesterday, and what Secretary Kerry said yesterday remains true today, which is that the United States has not received a specific extradition request from the Turkish government. We don't often discuss those kinds of requests publicly, but at this point, we have not received an extradition request from the Turkish government as it relates to Mr. Gulen. If and when we receive a request, we will evaluate that request based on the extradition treaty that was signed by the United States and Turkey more than 30 years ago.\nThere is a clear, well-established, mutually agreed upon process for considering those kinds of requests, and there are essentially two factors. The first is, the request would be evaluated to determine whether or not it was related to crimes that are covered by the extradition treaty. And then second, there would be an evaluation made jointly by the Department of State and by the Department of Justice to determine whether or not the evidentiary standard that's established -- that's described in the treaty is met in this case.\nSo the suggestion that somehow the United States is harboring Mr. Gulen is factually incorrect. The truth is there's been no extradition request put forward. And when it is, it is one that will be carefully considered by the U.S. government consistent with the extradition treaty that's been on the books for more than 30 years now.\nQ: Are you alarmed at all by the language with respect to that, suggesting being at war or suggesting that the friendship is at risk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned earlier, I think it's important that in actions and in words, officials in Turkey are conscious of the need to prevent further violence and instability. The United States has been unequivocal of our condemnation of the failed coup attempt, and just as unequivocal in our strong support for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. We believe those are institutions worth investing in.\nAnd in fact, that's actually a point that President Obama and other U.S. officials have made clear to Turkish officials for years now, even before this most recent coup attempt. And we'll continue to make that point of view known both publicly and privately to Turkish officials.\nQ: Has President Obama spoken to President Erdogan, or if not, does he intend to?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has not spoken to President Erdogan since the events of this weekend. But I would anticipate that President Obama will be on the phone with President Erdogan relatively soon. Once that call has taken place, we'll let you know.\nQ: Does that mean today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as soon as it's taken place, we'll let you know. I don't know if it will be today or tomorrow. But we'll keep you posted on that.\nPresident Obama, of course, had an opportunity to visit briefly with President Erdogan last weekend at the NATO Summit in Warsaw. In just the last couple of months, President Obama and President Erdogan have been on the phone three different times for a variety of different matters. And, of course, President Obama and President Erdogan had a brief visit when President Erdogan was in the United States for the Nuclear Security Summit earlier this spring.\nI also recall vividly briefings where we were detailing the frequent conversations that President Erdogan and President Obama had in person over the course of the fall, as well. So given events in the region, and given the important relationship between our two countries, President Obama and President Erdogan have had an opportunity to visit frequently.\nQ: Just not about this coup.\nMR. EARNEST: No. And I would anticipate that that will occur relatively soon. And when it does, we'll let you know.\nQ: And lastly, just on another topic, does the White House have a reaction to the acquittal today of the Baltimore policeman in the death of Freddie Gray?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific reaction to that legal proceeding. Obviously this is something that's best left to the courts, and so I don't have a reaction to it. Obviously, Baltimore is a community where distrust between local law enforcement and some members of the Baltimore community was exposed last summer. And there's been a lot of important work that's been done by officials in Baltimore to try to address some of those concerns. They've done that with the strong support of the Obama administration, including the Department of Justice.\nAt the same time, there is an ongoing Department of Justice investigation that the Department of Justice has announced into the Baltimore Police Department. So there's not a whole lot more I can say about it. But certainly we would expect that in the event there are those who have concerns with the outcome of this case, that they would register those concerns peacefully.\nMichelle.\nQ: Erdogan has been called out a number of times recently by international human rights -- for overreach in a number of areas -- things like press freedoms. So how concerned are you that this -- what some are calling a purge, or 6,000 arrests -- isn't an overreach that is going to be detrimental to democracy in Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I'm not prepared to pass judgment on the actions undertaken by the Erdogan government in just the last 24, 48 hours. Obviously, they're reacting to a rather extraordinary situation -- there was a failed coup attempt. And the United States has been strong in expressing our grave concern about that coup attempt, condemning it, and expressing our unequivocal support for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.\nAt the same time, we believe that that Turkish government has a responsibility to exercise restraint and certainly to be supportive of due process and the freedoms that are outlined in the Turkish constitution that include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly.\nQ: And the last couple of times we've heard the President speak out on violence involving race or police officers, which has been a number of times lately, he's mentioned the number of guns on America's streets. He's mentioned wanting Congress to do something about it. Why did he not bring up that subject in his remarks yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's message yesterday was focused on offering his condolences to the families of the officers who were killed yesterday. He was focused on offering his condolences to the broader community of Baton Rouge that's endured far too much violence over the last couple of weeks. And the President expressed his strong desire for the country to respond to this situation in a way that reflects our common values as American citizens. The President is hopeful that we won't see the kind of overheated, super-charged rhetoric that has a tendency to counterproductively enflame passions on both sides.\nThere's so much common ground to be established here. And I think that was on display over the course of the day yesterday. We saw -- we heard from many civil rights activists who've been expressing concerns about the conduct of some law enforcement officers and concerns about persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system. But those same civil rights activists forcefully condemned the slaying of these three police officers -- people like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, two individuals with long records as leaders in the civil rights community -- but even someone like Myra Richardson, a notable Black Lives Matter activist who said \"Today was just horrific, and it is obviously something that none of us condone.\"\nThere is strong support across this country for the idea that police officers shouldn't be gunned down just for being police officers. That's not a controversial notion. And the President was pleased to see the country coming together to condemn this outrageous act of violence and to show support for the vast majority of men and women in uniform who do an outstanding job protecting our community. And focusing on those common values and what we share in common is what will be required for us to make some of the progress that we'd all like to see.\nAnd I think that was the main message that the President wanted to deliver yesterday. That was not an effort to signal in any way a change in his view about the need for Congress to take some common-sense steps that would reduce gun violence in communities across the country.\nQ: So, just quickly, something else we've been hearing from him a lot lately is about the divisions in America and how he feels they're not as deep as some would portray them. But then we see these polls come out showing that most people feel that race relations in America are getting worse, and more than 70 percent from virtually any racial group feels like race relations are either bad or very bad. So what do you think -- I mean, does the President disagree with all of these Americans and how deep those divisions are?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has made the observation that given the tenor of the political debate and given the outbreak of violence that we've seen, it's understandable that people might feel pessimistic. The President talked in his remarks in Dallas about the inclination to give into despair. That is an understandable human reaction to this situation. But the President also spoke movingly about how much hope and inspiration he draws from the everyday actions of Americans.\nHe told the story of the woman in Dallas who was protesting, expressing her public concern about the conduct of some law enforcement officers, only to have law enforcement officers come to her rescue in a way that she described as heroic, and in a way that prompted her youngest son to say that he aspires to be a police officer when he grows up. That's evidence of a lot of common ground. That's evidence of a lot of people from a variety of perspectives sharing common values, sharing common values that are the essence of what it means to be an American.\nQ: Seventy-four percent of people feel that race relations are bad or very bad. Is the President -- are you disputing that?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think I just said that it's an understandable human reaction to the violence that we've seen, to the overheated rhetoric that we've seen in some quarters, the inclination to give in to some pessimism and maybe even despair is a natural human tendency.\nBut I think what is true is that over the last several decades, our country has made remarkable progress on this front. And to deny that progress is to deny the sacrifice made by Americans of all races to make our society and our country more just. That progress has never been in a straight lines, but that progress should be a source of hope and inspiration and confidence as we confront the challenge that this generation of Americans faces when it comes to making our country and our criminal justice system more fair and more just and more reflective of our efforts to form a more perfect union.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on Mr. Gulen. Outside of whether or not there's been an extradition request, I'm wondering, does the U.S. have any evidence independently of whether or not he was involved in the coup attempt in Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I'm not going to use this podium to discuss any evidence that's been collected by law enforcement. What I can tell you is that the United States government has made a commitment to the Turkish government that if they would like assistance in investigating the failed coup over the weekend, we're prepared to use resources at our disposal to assist them in that investigation. What those resources are, what we find out in the context of conducting that investigation if a request is made is not something I would likely discuss publicly.\nBut again, I think it's an indication of our commitment to due process and the rule of law, and that certainly is a commitment that we have encouraged the Erdogan government to continue to pursue as well.\nQ: Would you actually need a specific official request to investigate whether a resident of the U.S. was planning a coup attempt in another country that's a NATO ally? Is that something that you would actually have them -- actually need from the Turkish government -- for them to write you a letter saying, we want you to investigate? Or is that something you could do on your own?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, for any criminal investigations that are undertaken by the Department of Justice, you can check with them. My guess is they're not likely going to be prepared to discuss much publicly. But what we have made clear to Turkish officials is that if we can be helpful as they conduct the investigation into the failed coup attempt, we're prepared to use our resources to support our allies.\nQ: I also wanted to ask about the military purge you talked about earlier. A question I have is whether or not you're worried or concerned that so many military officials being purged, are being arrested, will have an impact on the U.S. relationship with the Turkish military, which I'm sure you all have been working on for the last few years. Is that something you're concerned about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not ready to pass judgment on any specific actions taken by the Erdogan government. Our view is that they should exercise restraint, that they need to act within the rule of law, and that they should avoid actions that could lead to further violence and instability.\nThe Turkish government and the Turkish people have long valued their democracy. They've long been proud of their democracy. They've long been proud of the rights that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution that protect the freedom of the press, the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly for all of Turkey's citizens. And respecting those freedoms and protecting those democratic traditions is important and something that the Turkish government should make a priority even as they confront these challenging times.\nQ: The President yesterday mentioned, as he was making his statement about Baton Rouge, he talked about (inaudible) and the importance of focusing on the rhetoric. I'm wondering, is the President concerned about violence at the upcoming conventions? Is that part of the reason he's having Loretta Lynch come in tomorrow, to talk about what we've seen in terms of the last couple of weeks? Is that something that the President is specifically concerned about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, the President has got confidence in the year's worth of work that the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Secret Service have devoted to working with state and local law enforcement officials in Cleveland and Philadelphia respectively to ensure the safety and security of the political conventions this year. Those efforts are organized around the idea that the candidates and the delegates and the media should all be able to participate in the democratic process of choosing a party nominee safely.\nThose security plans also incorporate the rights of those protesting the convention to express their views peacefully. This is what a democracy should look like. The Obama administration has taken steps to work with local officials to ensure that that's what occurs. And the President certainly has confidence. And I think the reference that the President was making -- the President yesterday was referring to overheated rhetoric from politicians that tends to get even hotter in the midst of a political convention. Particularly at this time, given the violence that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, that kind of rhetoric would be particularly divisive and something the President believes that our country's political leaders should try to avoid.\nQ: And just one more about the convention. There have been some calls for the open-carry law in Ohio be suspended during the convention there. Police, community leaders have said that they want that to happen. I think Sherrod Brown also mentioned that that should be considered. Does the White House have a position on whether the governor should consider banning open-carry during the week of the convention?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, for the specific tactical operational security decisions that have to be made, we're going to defer to the professionals. Like I said, the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service have been on the ground in Cleveland and Philadelphia for a year now, working with state and local officials to implement security plans to keep everybody safe. So we'll let them determine what steps can and should be taken.\nThe President has already expressed his concern with the risks that are enhanced by some of these open-carry laws. The situation in Dallas was a pretty good example of that. You have police officers protecting a peaceful protest who come under fire from somebody wielding a high-powered weapon. The challenge the police officers had to protect themselves and to protect the protestors was made far more complicated by the fact that there were a lot of people walking around in public with high-powered weapons. It makes it particularly difficult to determine who the shooter is and who just is an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire.\nIt is a testament to the professionalism and courage of the men and women in the Dallas Police Department that they didn't shoot the wrong person. Ordinarily, you would say that justification for the use of force by a police officer in a situation like that -- you could imagine the police officer saying that person had a gun, in explaining why they might have shot somebody. Again, that shows a lot of heroism and a lot of courage and a lot of professionalism and a lot of good judgment exercised under some of the worst circumstances you could imagine.\nAnd if we're going to have a conversation in this country about what we can do to try to make the job of being a cop a little less dangerous, the President believes this is one place we could start.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Is it consistent with the White House's understanding of the agreement that our government has with the Turkish government that they would be able to cut power and restrict air traffic, essentially, in and out of Incirlik in circumstances like we saw the other day?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, when it comes to these kinds of military facilities that are located on foreign soil, obviously U.S. forces and our ability to operate on those bases is at the invitation of the host government. We're certainly not going to call into question their sovereignty or violate their sovereignty.\nBut for the way that those relationships are managed, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. But I understand what they have indicated is that the Turkish government did take the appropriate steps to ensure the safety and security of U.S. service members, other national security civilians and their families who are located there. And again, as it relates to the power source for this one particular military facility, you should check with the Department of Defense.\nQ: Is it also the White House's understanding that as the Erdogan government continues to round up individuals that the relationship as it has been laid out as a fellow NATO member is solid?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States strongly values our relationship with our NATO ally, Turkey. There's obviously a lot of business that the United States and Turkey are engaged in right now to the mutual benefit of both our countries. Not just -- even outside of our specific NATO responsibilities, the United States and Turkey obviously working closely together to confront the extremist threat posed by ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. We also work together to shut down the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria that could potentially boost the capability of not just ISIL but other extremist groups, including al Qaeda's presence in Syria.\nSo there are important priorities on which the United States and Turkey are closely coordinating. We value that relationship. It benefits both our countries. And I don't anticipate that -- there's no good reason why that close coordination and effective working relationship shouldn't continue into the future.\nQ: So from the White House's perspective, there's been no fracture in any way or any shape in the resulting days since the coup attempt?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, obviously we've seen some of this rhetoric from some Turkish officials about the status of Mr. Gulen. But at this point, when it comes to our efforts to coordinate on ISIL and other extremists in Iraq and Syria, we're continuing to coordinate quite effectively with the Turks in a way that's enhancing the national security of both our countries.\nQ: And in France, is it likely that the United States government will send a representative to Nice to represent us in the mourning of the victims of that attack?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I don't know the details for that memorial service at this point, but I'm confident that there will be some U.S. representation at that event.\nQ: Highest level, meaning the President? Perhaps the Vice President?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't anticipate that the President will travel to Nice, but I'm confident that the United States will be represented at that event.\nQ: Just a couple more. I get this question a lot from not just our viewers but also people who just write me, wondering about this notion of the White House being illuminated in blue. I've asked you about this previously. It seems to be such a very small but potentially powerful gesture that would take so little and would mean so much to so many. And I'm just wondering if there might be any reconsideration, especially given what has now just happened again in Baton Rouge.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I don't anticipate that that's something that we'll do. But obviously the President did travel to Dallas to attend a memorial service of the five Dallas police officers who were killed. After the service, the President spent time meeting with the families of each of the officers who was killed. He also spent time with the officers who were wounded in protecting protestors and eventually taking down the shooter that posed such a significant threat to the community there.\nIn response to that tragic event, the President signed an order lowering the flags across the country to half-staff to reflect the mourning that our nation engaged in for the police officers who were killed in Dallas. The President spoke yesterday powerfully condemning the killing of police officers in Baton Rouge. He expressed his strong support for police officers in Baton Rouge and for the broader community that's grieving the violence they had seen in that community over the last couple of weeks.\nI would anticipate that soon, the President will have an opportunity to call the families of the police officers who were killed in Baton Rouge yesterday. I think all of this is an indication of just how strongly the President feels about the need to show our strong support for our men and women in law enforcement. As the President has said on a number of occasions, the vast majority of our police officers do an outstanding job and they do heroic work. They put on the uniform and walk out the door prepared to put their life on the line at a moment's notice just to protect their community. And that is work that is worthy of our respect and our praise, and not our scorn. And the President feels quite strongly about that.\nAnd the President had an opportunity to convey that directly to law enforcement officials that were here at the White House at the beginning of last week. He had an opportunity to express that strong support for our police officers at a four-hour meeting that he convened with civil rights leaders and academics and law enforcement officials and political leaders to discuss some of the challenges that are encountered by police officers and law enforcement organizations across the country, particularly as they try to sustain and even strengthen the bonds of trust that they have with the communities that they serve.\nBut the President dedicated a lot of time to this, both in substance and in symbolism. The President's strong support for American law enforcement officers is crystal-clear.\nQ: But I'm just curious about the -- I don't know, Josh, it just seems sometimes that there's this disconnect; that despite his efforts, it's not reaching that community in a way that is reflective of perhaps his intentions. Is he frustrated by that? Because it seems like if you listen to some folks in law enforcement, they don't feel like they're getting the kind of support that they need. I don't know what that looks like -- I'm not in law enforcement. And so I'm just wondering, do you sense that disconnect? And is that frustrating in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I think the President has been engaged in a lot of work over the last week, week and a half, to try to bring the country together; that some of the tension and some of the violence that we've seen in this country has started to pull people in different directions. And the President has worked hard and I think been conspicuous about his efforts to try to make sure that the country recognizes the common interest that we have as a country.\nAnd the violence that we've seen in this country does I think pose a significant challenge to our political system, that the kind of dysfunction and division that we've seen in Washington, D.C. does leave people with the impression -- does leave American citizens with the impression that our country is more divided than it actually is.\nThe vast majority of Americans believe that it is unjustified to carry out any act of violence against a police officer just because they're wearing the uniform. The vast majority of Americans I think are concerned about the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system. And they I think have pointed questions that were raised by some of the videos that we've seen of interactions between police officers and African American men. That doesn't mean those Americans are anti-cop. It doesn't mean they're anti-law enforcement. It just means that they've got some concerns based on the video.\nAnd the President's desire is to make sure we recognize that there's a whole lot more that unites us, there's a whole lot more that we have in common -- even when it comes to our concerns, even when it comes to our sadness about innocent loss of life -- and that focusing on that unity and focusing on what we have in common is what will be necessary to help us move past some of these challenges that have beset our country over the last couple of weeks.\nQ: Josh, just to follow up a little bit on Freddie Gray. We've heard the President talk in recent days about one of the ways that tensions can be eased between communities and law enforcement is that -- open and transparent investigations, and thorough due process. This is now the fourth officer to stand trial. There have been no convictions. Not to get into the legal -- like you said, don't want to talk about this particular case -- but what does the President say then -- as transparent investigation. These charges came very quickly. But to those who say justice isn't served because of how this ended up then in court?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, knowing that I'm just not going to be in a position to talk about the individual court proceedings, I think what we have seen is an effort by local officials in Baltimore, including the police department, to try to address some of the concerns that have been raised by the community. The United States Department of Justice has been supportive of the efforts by officials in Baltimore to try to address some of these concerns that have been raised.\nIt's hard to talk about that in a lot of detail because the other path to some justice here is relevant to an ongoing Department of Justice investigation of the Baltimore Police Department, so I certainly don't want to say anything that could be perceived as influencing that investigation, either. But this is -- obviously, what's happening in Baltimore is indicative of the kind of challenge that other communities across the country are facing. And the President has said many times that our success in confronting those challenges requires follow-through. And there's a tendency for these kinds of issues, as it relates to policing and equality and justice in our criminal justice system, have a tendency to bubble up when there are headlines, but then recede into the background and recede lower on the priority list when they're not the focus of public attention.\nAnd much of the conversation that the President convened last week with law enforcement officials and political leaders and academics and civil rights leaders, the sort of wide-ranging discussion from people of a variety of perspectives on this issue was about the need for follow-through, about the need for some persistence and some tenacity as communities try to pursue specific solutions. And that's certainly something that a lot of communities can take to heart as they try to confront the situation in their own cities.\nQ: One on Turkey. U.S. citizens were told to avoid the area near the U.S. consulate in Istanbul because of the demonstrations today. Any concerns right now that the security there, any plans to beef up security around there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, of course, when you see this kind of instability in a country where there are a large number of Americans the President's very first concern is about the safety and security of our diplomats, our service members, and our diplomatic and military facilities inside the country. The President is also, of course, concerned about other American citizens who may not be there in any sort of official role but are inside Turkey. So these were the first questions the President was asking on Friday night.\nWhat I can tell you is that we were pleased by the response of the Turkish government to ensure that U.S. facilities, both diplomatic and military, have been protected. And that includes in advance of the planned protests today outside of diplomatic facilities in Istanbul and Ankara. In both cases, the Turkish government lived up to the responsibility that they have to ensure the protection of diplomatic installations. And we would expect that kind of cooperation and good faith to continue in the weeks ahead.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, the Turkish President has said that if he's asked to approve the death penalty, he will. When the President speaks to Mr. Erdogan, will he urge him, in that restraint you referenced, specifically not to carry out the death penalty?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't want to prejudge their call. I think that what we have been saying and what I would anticipate the President to repeat is to urge restraint, to avoid actions or words that could further incite more violence or instability.\nTurkey has a long tradition of democracy, and it's been beset by challenges, including military coups, over the last several decades. But the Turkish people are justifiably proud of their constitution and the values that are enshrined in it. And the President believes strongly that it's important for not just the Turkish people but the Turkish government to protect those traditions, to abide by them, and to invest in the democratic institutions that are critical to effective functioning of that country and that society.\nQ: But the EU has been very explicit, saying that if you roll out the death penalty you can't be part of the EU. I know you don't want to prejudge the phone call, but has the White House endorsed that sentiment? I know you don't want to prejudge the phone call, but is that the idea that you're endorsing here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the President, whenever he has these discussions with Erdogan -- and to be clear, the President has had these kinds of conversations with President Ergogan in the past about the need for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey to exercise restraint and to be respectful and even protective of the democratic practices and traditions of that country. Those conversations occurred at the highest level even before this most recent coup attempt.\nBut in each of those conversations, the President is always respectful of the sovereignty of the Turkish government. And ultimately, it's the Turkish President, consistent with the traditions and due process of the country, that should make the decisions about how to rule the country. The President is not going to stand on the sidelines and dictate outcomes, but I do think you can expect the President to renew his call for restraint and urge everyone in Turkey to respect that country's democratic institutions. And that's certainly consistent with our forceful support for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.\nQ: If the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey doesn't uphold democratic values, which the White House has suggested they haven't in those conversations that you just referenced to as well, at what point do you start to question U.S. support there? Or is Turkey just so needed because of the operations with NATO, for so many reasons, that the U.S. will stand by Turkey even if we see the overreach that you fear?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't want to get into hypotheticals. Obviously the Turkish government and people of Turkey are dealing with an extraordinary situation here. There's been a failed coup attempt that occurred not even 72 hours ago, and --\nQ: And he acted very quickly, thousands rounded up in a very short amount of time.\nMR. EARNEST: And I'm not going to second-guess the individual actions that are taken by the Turkish government. But I will reiterate something that's been reiterated many times in private as well, which is that the Turkish government should exercise restraint, that they should demonstrate a commitment to due process, they should demonstrate a continued commitment to the values that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution.\nThe Turkish people are genuinely proud, and justifiably proud, of the democratic traditions in that country. And those traditions and practices are worth protecting.\nQ: And finally, Mr. Gulen's followers here in the U.S. have raised concerns of being targeted themselves. Have you seen anything like that? And is the U.S. in any way offering protection to Mr. Gulen in light of these concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific steps that have been taken with regard to protecting Mr. Gulen. I guess I'd refer you to local law enforcement authorities in Pennsylvania. Our position vis-а-vis his relationship the Turkish government is clear.\nYes, sir.\nQ: On Turkey again. Today Secretary Kerry talk about whether Turkey's NATO membership might be at risk and the State Department walked back a little bit. But I would like to ask you, do you see Turkey's NATO membership, if it doesn't adhere to democratic values, be at risk going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear -- again, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about what might happen going forward. Our message to the Turks both in public and in private is to urge them to exercise restraint, particularly at this volatile time. We certainly don't want to see anybody taking actions that could lead to greater instability or more violence. There are important universal values and rights that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution, and we believe those values and rights are worth protecting. We believe everybody has some responsibility for doing that, including the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.\nWe'll make that point clear in public and in private. That is a President that we've emphasized in our interactions with the Turkish government prior to the recent failed coup attempt, and that's a message that we'll continue to deliver in the aftermath.\nAs it relates to Turkey's membership in NATO, even in those periods in Turkey's recent history where they haven't had a democratically elected civilian government, they've been members of NATO, so that's a relevant fact. But we certainly believe that the people of Turkey have benefitted significantly from a commitment to democratic values and the protection of freedoms that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution. We certainly want to urge everyone to support those values moving forward.\nQ: -- there have been (inaudible) news websites in Turkey shut down. There are lists being published for those journalists to be arrested. I have a friend -- journalist friend -- statement that more were issued this morning. Do you think after the coup attempt, is this justified for Mr. Erdogan to go after journalists and shut down the news websites?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have previously been critical -- I'm not aware of the specific reports that you're referring to. Let me just say that I have previously been asked about some steps that have been taken by the Turkish government against independent journalists in Turkey, and I've raised the significant concerns the United States government has with those kinds of steps. The fact is freedom of the press is one of the rights that's enshrined in Turkey's constitution and we believe that's a freedom that's worth protecting.\nI do also recall, on a recent visit to the United States that some members of President Erdogan's entourage were engaged in a scuffle with some journalists here in the United States. That certainly is conduct that we do not condone at all. The United States strongly believes in the importance of press freedom. We believe that freedom of the press is critical to the strength and success of our democracy here in the United States. And we believe that's a universal human right that extends to other countries as well. Fortunately, in this case, it's enshrined in Turkey's constitution. And we believe that democratically elected civilian government of Turkey should protect it. And we believe that everybody in Turkey should protect those kinds of practices and traditions that have been critical to Turkey's success as a country and as a society.\nQ: Can you tell us when did you first know the coup was happening? Did you have an initial report? What time was it on July 15? How did you learn about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't have a specific time stamp to share with you. Obviously there were a lot of public reports about unusual military movements inside of Turkey. Obviously United States officials are in regular touch with their Turkish counterparts, so there presumably were reports that went beyond just the public reporting on this matter. But obviously it was a confused situation inside of Turkey for several hours. That was true of the people inside of Turkey, including the Turkey government, and there was not a lot of clarity for people outside of Turkey about what exactly was happening.\nBut obviously Secretary Kerry has been in frequent touch with his Turkish counterpart. President Obama was on the phone with his Secretary of State to hear firsthand about some of those conversations and from information that was being collected by the State Department that obviously has a substantial presence inside of Turkey. The President convened a conference call with many members of his national security and foreign policy team on Saturday morning where he was briefed with the latest information. So the President has a variety of mechanisms for staying up to date on fast-moving global events, and that machinery was well-exercised over the weekend.\nQ: So you didn't know before it happened, was my final question. You knew before it happened, or after it started? What was it?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any sort of intelligence assessment or intelligence information to share. But I think it's fair to say that the nature of a coup is that not many people know in advance, before it happens.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, I'm curious -- you've been asked now by my count at least two or three times the simple question, is Turkey's NATO membership secure, and you don't answer yes or no. You answer by saying we hope they show restraint, protect rights, et cetera. That sort of puzzles me. Why isn't this a simple yes or no question? Is Turkey's NATO membership secure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not trying to be obtuse here. Turkey's NATO status I think is quite clear and it is secure, based on their own judgments, based on the conversation that President Erdogan had with the Secretary General of NATO earlier today, and again, based on Turkey's history, which is that even in those periods in their recent history where they have not had a democratically elected civilian government, they've been a member of NATO.\nThey are making important contributions to the security of our alliance. We also have an important national security relationship with them when it comes to fighting ISIL and other extremists in Iraq and in Syria. So the United States has an important relationship with Turkey, including a national security relationship that benefits both our countries and the citizens of both our countries.\nMark.\nQ: Let me stick with Turkey for a second, because there's this little question that I think is a yes/no that I still don't think you've answered, which is did the U.S. have any prior knowledge that a coup was going to be taking place in Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think in this situation, I just don't have an intelligence assessment to offer. But I think it is -- I think the very definition of a coup is that not many people are aware of a secret plot to overthrow the government.\nQ: But one of those people could have been an American official.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to what may have been known by an individual U.S. intelligence officer. But I think what is clear is that even with some information foreshadowing an event like that, while the situation is occurring it's unclear exactly what's happening on the ground, how well it's being executed, how much support there is across the government.\nBut what's clear is that the United States has always and will continue to strongly support the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. The United States government is strongly supportive of Turkey's democratic institutions and traditions. And it's why we've been unequivocal in condemning the failed coup attempt.\nQ: Can I go back to the race-policing issue? You mentioned the Lynch meeting tomorrow that's been added to the President's schedule. Are we looking at any other meetings this week, a continuation, if you will, of the conversations that the President held in several venues last week?\nMR. EARNEST: There's the potential for that, but we'll obviously keep you posted if things like that are added to the President's schedule.\nQ: Okay. Did the President -- I mean, you mentioned he spent so much time and effort last week in these pretty sometimes raw, emotional sessions, heartfelt people from various different walks of life and viewpoints on this. Does the President feel last week accomplished anything, especially in light of what happened in Baton Rouge?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's a hard thing to assess. What the President spent a lot of his time on last week was trying to do a couple of things. The first is to help the American people recognize that we're not nearly as divided as it may seem. You might conclude from the overheated political rhetoric or the dysfunction in Congress that somehow the citizens of this country just can't see eye to eye. The President doesn't believe that's true. And there are a variety of ways to evaluate that.\nAnd I think whether it is -- the outpouring of support for the police officers and the community of Dallas in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy there is one example of that. The outpouring of support that we've seen for the community of Baton Rouge and the families of the police officers who were killed yesterday I think is an example of that. The harsh condemnation, even among civil rights activists who have raises concerns about the conduct of the Baton Rouge Police Department I think is good evidence of that.\nThose of you who had the opportunity to travel with the President to Dallas and attend the memorial service saw just how diverse the crowd was of people who were in attendance at the memorial service. So I think that's an indication that there is a whole lot more that unites us than divides us.\nAnd the President believes that that often is easily overshadowed by rhetoric from attention-seeking politicians to viral videos that show up in our Facebook feeds that contain horrible acts of violence. So there's a lot to cut through there. But the President believes that that's a point that's worth repeating.\nThere was also a genuine conversation about what specific, tangible steps can we take to address the concerns that have been raised by people in the civil rights community, but also do more to support our men and women in law enforcement who have incredibly difficult jobs.\nQ: But, Josh, after all the President's impassioned words last week, we still had a shooter open up and kill police officers.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, but, Mark, that guy, by definition, is a madman. He attacked police officers in a way that is totally unjustified and totally unjustifiable. And I don't think that's a fair standard at all to evaluate the President's performance or his message.\nI think what's also true is that this is going to be a longer-term proposition. This is not the kind of problem that we are going to confront, address, and put behind us as a society in the next six months or even over the next six years. This is going to require sort of the sustained commitment and willingness on the part of people all across our society, both inside and outside of government, making it a priority. And the President is certainly committed to that task, and hopefully we'll see other people of goodwill do the same.\nGoyal.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two questions. As far as the coup in Turkey is concerned, according to the (inaudible) at the Middle Eastern Institute, and also experts there, what they are saying is, is the U.S. worried about next could be Pakistan? Because they said that Pakistan also had a history of many, many coups and it may not fail if it happened in Pakistan because the current Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, is very unpopular among the people there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly not going to speculate about the political situation in another country. Obviously the United States has an important relationship with Pakistan. We don't agree on everything, but we certainly have been able to effectively coordinate on a variety of national security issues that's important to fighting extremists and protecting the citizens in both our countries.\nSo the relationship between the United States and Turkey is different than the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Pakistan is not a NATO ally, but certainly the United States benefits from our ability to have a productive relationship with Pakistan, particularly as it relates to national security cooperation.\nQ: And second, as far as the recent arguments and decisions by the Supreme Court, especially on immigration, many experts, including the lawyers and the common people who were waiting for this decision, and also, of course, waiting that President Obama will bring some light in their life -- what they're asking is, since the Supreme Court has only eight justices, not nine, but four and four, on immigration, but fifth could have been in favor. So why somebody has taken this immigration issue -- so what is the future of the immigration now, do you think? Because since the decision is not by the nine justices but only the eight.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a couple of things here, and both of them go back to Congress. The first is --\nQ: I'm sorry to interrupt you -- do you the President can order another review by the eight that could be 5 and 3?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the way I'll answer your question is in two ways and both of them have to do with Congress. The first is, the President believes that the Supreme Court of the United States functions most effectively when it has the full complement of justices. And this is something that President Reagan spoke to -- about how the work of the Supreme Court and the work of the American people is not getting done as long as there's a prolonged vacancy on the Supreme Court.\nThe second is, when it comes to immigration reform, the President has long acknowledged that his administrative actions to try to fix some aspects of our broken immigration system are not in any way a substitute for legislative action and reforms that are passed through legislation. That's something that's not going to happen in this Congress, but hopefully the next President and the next Congress will be able to get it done.\nThe President certainly has been pushing in that direction, because of the work of President Obama and his team, we did build strong bipartisan support in the United States Senate for a common-sense legislative proposal. Unfortunately, it was blocked by Republican leaders in the House -- otherwise it would have gotten through. So there certainly is a path for a future Congress to succeed, and hopefully they will.\nQ: And finally, what is the presidential message to those who are waiting -- 11 million or so? But they are working hard and they want to pay taxes and all they want is to be good citizens of the U.S. just like anybody else. So what do you think they should do now with the decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President's message is that we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants. And he certainly is hopeful that the kind of widespread bipartisan support that we see all across the country for common-sense immigration reform is hopefully something that will manifest itself in bipartisan support in Congress. But there's some dysfunction in Congress that needs to be addressed, and hopefully it will.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:12 P.M.

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120851", "text": "I join President Obama in strongly condemning today's targeted attack on law enforcement in Baton Rouge that killed three police officers and wounded three others. It's despicable. It's cowardly. And it's an attack on our very way of life and rule of law.\nLike thousands of other law enforcement officers who got up this morning, the officers killed and wounded were sworn to protect their community. And they responded. They responded to help. And every time they responded to help they knew they were putting themselves in danger. Police officers are an incredible group of men and women. We owe them our gratitude and a commitment not to let others divide us. That's not who they were, that's not who they are.\nMy heart goes out to the families. And my enduring thanks to all those police officers who are protecting us as we speak. We owe them.\nMay God bless the fallen, their families, and their brothers and sisters in uniform.", "timestamp": "2016-07-18", "title": "Statement by the Vice President on the Attack on Police Officers in Baton Rouge"}

In his remarks, he referred to Ypsilanti, MI, resident William Vollano, a local Veterans History Project coordinator for the Library of Congress's American Folklife Center; and former Rep. John D. Dingell, Jr. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the reading of the citation.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117877", "text": "Good morning, everybody. Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Of all the privileges of this office, none is greater than serving as the Commander in Chief of the finest military that the world has ever known. And of all the military decorations that our Nation can bestow, we have none higher than the Medal of Honor.\nAs many who know him have said, nobody deserves it more than Charles Kettles of Ypsilanti, Michigan. Many believe that, except for Chuck. [Laughter] As he says, this \"seems like a hell of a fuss over something that happened 50 years ago.\" [Laughter]\nEven now, all these years later, Chuck is still defined by the humility that shaped him as a soldier. At 86 years old, he still looks sharp as a tack in that uniform. I pointed out, he obviously has not gained any weight. [Laughter] And his life is as American as they come. He's the son of an immigrant. His father signed up to fly for the United States the day after Pearl Harbor and filled his five boys with a deep sense of duty to their country. For a time, he even served in the Army Reserve—for a time, even as he served in the Army Reserve, Chuck ran a Ford dealership with his brother. And to families who drove a new car off that lot, he's the salesman who helped put an American icon in their driveway.\nTo the aviation students at Eastern Michigan University, Chuck is the professor who taught them about the wonder of flight in the country that invented it. To the constituents he served as a rare Republican in his hometown's mostly Democratic city council—[laughter]—Chuck is the public servant who made sure that their voices were heard. And to Ann, his beautiful bride, who grew up literally as the girl next door, Chuck is a devoted husband. Next March they will celebrate their 40th anniversary. So happy early anniversary.\nSo in a lot of ways, Chuck Kettles is America. And to the dozens of American soldiers that he saved in Vietnam half a century ago, Chuck is the reason they lived and came home and had children and grandchildren, entire family trees made possible by the actions of this one man.\nWe are honored to be joined not only by Ann, but also 8 of Chuck and Ann's 10 children, and 3 of their grandchildren. It's the Kettles family reunion here in the White House. [Laughter] We're also honored to be joined by Chuck's brothers-in-arms from Vietnam and some of Chuck's newest comrades, members of the Medal of Honor Society.\nMay 15, 1967, started as a hot Monday morning. Soldiers from the 101st Airborne were battling hundreds of heavily armed North Vietnamese in a rural riverbed. Our men were outnumbered. They needed support fast, helicopters to get the wounded out and bring more soldiers into the fight. Chuck Kettles was a helo pilot. And just as he'd volunteered for Active Duty, on this morning he volunteered his Hueys, even though he knew the danger. They called this place \"Chump Valley\" for a reason: Above the riverbed rose a 1,500-foot-tall hill, and the enemy was dug into an extensive series of tunnels and bunkers, the ideal spot for an ambush.\nBut Chuck jumped into the cockpit and took off. Around 9 a.m., his company of Hueys approached the landing zone and looked down. They should have seen a stand of green trees; instead, they saw a solid wall of green enemy tracers coming right at them. None of them had ever seen fire that intense. Soldiers in the helos were hit and killed before they could even leap off. But under withering fire, Chuck landed his chopper and kept it there, exposed, so the wounded could get on and so that he could fly them back to base.\nA second time, Chuck went back into the valley. He dropped off more soldiers and supplies, picked up more wounded. Once more, machine-gun bullets and mortar rounds came screaming after them. As he took off a second time, rounds pierced the arm and leg of Chuck's door gunner, Roland Scheck. Chuck's Huey was hit. Fuel was pouring out as he flew away. But Chuck had wounded men aboard and decided to take his chances. He landed, found another helicopter, and flew Roland to the field hospital.\nBy now, it was near evening. Back in the riverbed, 44 American soldiers were still pinned down. The air was thick with gunpowder, smelled of burning metal. And then, they heard a faint sound, and as the Sun started to set, they saw something rise over the horizon: six American helicopters—as one of them said, \"as beautiful as could be.\" For a third time, Chuck and his unit headed into that hell on Earth. Death or injury was all but certain, a fellow pilot said later, and \"a lesser person would not return.\" Once again, the enemy unloaded everything they had on Chuck as he landed: small arms, automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades.\nSoldiers ran to the helicopters. When Chuck was told all were accounted for, he took off. And then, midair, his radio told him something else: Eight men had not made it aboard. They had been providing cover for the others. Those eight soldiers had run for the choppers, but could only watch as they floated away. \"We all figured we were done for,\" they said. Chuck came to the same conclusion. \"If we left them for 10 minutes,\" he said, \"they'd be POWs or dead.\"\nA soldier who was there said, \"That day, Major Kettles became our John Wayne.\" [Laughter] With all due respect to John Wayne—[laughter]—he couldn't do what Chuck Kettles did. He broke off from formation, took a steep, sharp, descending turn back toward the valley, this time with no aerial or artillery support, a lone helicopter heading back in. Chuck's Huey was the only target for the enemy to attack, and they did. Tracers lit up the sky once more. Chuck became—Chuck came in so hot that his chopper bounced for several hundred feet before coming to a stop. As soon as he landed, a mortar round shattered his windshield. Another hit the main rotor blade. Shrapnel tore through the cockpit and Chuck's chair. And still, those eight soldiers started to sprint to the Huey, running through the firestorm, chased by bullets.\nChuck's helo, now badly damaged, was carrying 13 souls and was 600 pounds over limit. It felt, he said, like flying a 2½-ton truck. [Laughter] He couldn't hover long enough to take off. But cool customer that he is, he says he saw his shattered windshield and thought, \"That's pretty good air conditioning.\" [Laughter] The cabin filled with black smoke as Chuck hopped and skipped the helo across the ground to pick up enough speed to takeoff, like a jackrabbit, he said, bouncing across the riverbed.\nThe instant he got airborne, another mortar ripped into the tail, the Huey fishtailed violently, and a soldier was thrown out of the helicopter, hanging onto a skid as Chuck flew them to safety. Couldn't make this up. [Laughter] This is like a bad \"Rambo\" movie. [Laughter] Right? You're listening to this, you're—you can't believe it. [Laughter]\nSo the Army's warrior ethos is based on a simple principle: A soldier never leaves his comrades behind. Chuck Kettles honored that creed, not with a single act of heroism, but over and over and over. And because of that heroism, 44 American soldiers made it out that day—44. We are honored today to be joined by some of them: Chuck's door gunner who was hit, Roland Scheck; the last soldier Chuck rescued that day, the one who figured he was done for, Dewey Smith; and a number of soldiers, our Vietnam veterans, who fought in that battle. Gentlemen, I would ask you to either stand if you can or wave so that we can thank you for your service.\nNow, Chuck's heroism was recognized at the time by the Army's second highest award for gallantry, the Distinguished Service Cross. But Bill Vollano decided Chuck deserved an upgrade. Bill is a retired social worker who went to Chuck's house to interview him for a Veterans History Project sponsored by the local Rotary Club. Ann overheard the interview from the other room and reminded Chuck to tell Bill the story I've just told all of you. So this is something Chuck and I have in common: We do what our wives tell us to do. [Laughter] Chuck told the story, and with his trademark humility, finished it by saying it was \"a piece of cake.\" [Laughter]\nBill, hearing the story, knew it was something more, and he started a 5-year mission, along with Chuck's son Mike, a retired Navy pilot, to award Chuck the Medal of Honor. Bill and Mike are here, as is Congresswoman Debbie Dingell who, along with her legendary husband, John Dingell, went above and beyond to pass a law to make sure that even all these years later, we could still fully recognize Chuck Kettles' heroism, as we do today. So we thank them for their outstanding efforts.\nAnd that's one more reason this story is quintessentially American: looking out for one another, the belief that nobody should be left behind. This is—this shouldn't just be a creed for our soldiers, it should be a creed for all of us. This is a country that's never finished in its mission to improve, to do better, to learn from our history, to work to form a more perfect Union. And at a time when, let's face it, we've had a couple of tough weeks, for us to remember the goodness and decency of the American people, and the way that we can all look out for each other, even when times are tough, even when the odds are against us—what a wonderful inspiration. What a great gift for us to be able to celebrate something like this.\nIt might take time, but having failed to give our veterans who fought in Vietnam the full measure of thanks and respect that they had earned, we acknowledge that our failure to do so was a shame. We resolve that it will never happen again. It can take time, but old adversaries can find peace. Thanks to the leadership of so many Vietnam vets who had the courage to rebuild ties, I was able to go to Vietnam recently and see a people as enthusiastic about America as probably any place in the world, crowds lining the streets. And we were able to say that, on a whole lot of issues, Vietnam and the United States are now partners. Here at home, it might take time, but we have to remember everyone on our team, just like Chuck Kettles. Sometimes, we have to turn around and head back and help those who need a lift.\nChuck says the most gratifying part of this whole story is that Dewey's name and Roland's name and the names of the 42 other Americans he saved are not etched in the solemn, granite wall not far from here that memorializes the fallen in the Vietnam war. Instead, it will be Chuck Kettles's name forever etched on the walls that communities have built from Southern California to South Carolina in honor of those who have earned the Medal of Honor.\nOf course, Chuck says all this attention is \"a lot of hubbub, but I'll survive.\" [Laughter] Chuck, you've survived much worse than this ceremony. [Laughter] And on behalf of the American people, let me say that this hubbub is richly and roundly deserved. As the Military Aide prepares to read the citation, please join me in saluting this proud American soldier and veteran who reminds us all of the true meaning of service: Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Kettles. [At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Richard I. Lawlor, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Andrew C. Steadman, USA, Army Aide to the President. Following the presentation of the medal, Maj. Gen. Paul K. Hurley, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains said a prayer.]\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes the ceremony, but we have a reception. I hear the food here is pretty good. [Laughter] Let's give one more round of applause to Mr. Chuck Kettles.", "timestamp": "2016-07-18", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Medal of Honor to Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles"}

The ideals that sparked our revolution find their truest expression in democracy, and our enduring belief in the right to self-govern is not limited to our borders—we believe the human impulse toward freedom is universal. During Captive Nations Week, we recognize the inherent dignity of all people, and we renew our support for those struggling under oppressive regimes and striving to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity.\nAfter World War II, America joined with other nations to remake the world—to rebuild, to forge a new international order, and to advance a more just and lasting peace. And following a decades-long Cold War, with strength and resolve and the power of our ideals, we rejoiced as an Iron Curtain was brought down and a new beginning was set in motion. But although more people live in democracies today—and despite the fact that we are witness to the most peaceful and prosperous era in human history—such progress is not inevitable, and dangerous forces threaten to pull the world backward.\nWe must bolster our commitment to upholding freedom and democracy wherever they are jeopardized. That means ensuring the people of Ukraine have the right to choose their own destiny and ensure their independence; it means helping the millions of those displaced from Syria seek a better and safer future, while continuing our efforts to bring an end to this brutal conflict and destroy ISIL. It also means discussing our differences with nations more directly. And we have opened a new chapter in our relationship with Cuba, which includes direct engagement with their government on human rights and steps to empower and create opportunity for the Cuban people.\nAround the world, a new generation of young people—connected by technology and driven by idealism and a willingness to stand up for their beliefs—is calling for more accountability in government. As heirs to a struggle for freedom that has long defined our character, Americans must lead by example and chart new paths to liberty and opportunity. We will continue to stand for equality and dignity beyond our borders and encourage economic and political reforms that foster democracy. And we remain dedicated to leading and working with others to build security, prosperity, and justice, and to fighting for any person still suffering under the grasp of tyranny.\nThis week, let us rededicate ourselves to broadening democracy's reach and promoting its true pillars—the rule of law, fair elections, a free press, and a vibrant civil society. As we work to lift up the lives of those whose governments still rule by fear and intimidation, let us stay vigilant in defense of democratic values and the ideals that keep us free.\nThe Congress, by joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as \"Captive Nations Week.\" Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 17 through July 23, 2016, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm our deep ties to all governments and people committed to freedom, dignity, and opportunity for all.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-07-18", "title": "Proclamation 9469—Captive Nations Week, 2016"}

The letter referred to Dallas, TX, resident Bill Connor.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118952", "text": "To the brave members of our Nation's law enforcement community:\nEvery day, you confront danger so it does not find our families, carry burdens so they do not fall to us, and courageously meet test after test to keep us safe. Like Dallas officer Lorne Ahrens, who bought dinner for a homeless man the night before he died, you perform good deeds beyond the call of duty and out of the spotlight. Time and again, you make the split-second decisions that could mean life or death for you and many others in harm's way. You endure the tense minutes and long hours over lifetimes of service.\nEvery day, you accept this responsibility and you see your colleagues do their difficult, dangerous jobs with equal valor. I want you to know that the American people see it, too. We recognize it, we respect it, we appreciate it, and we depend on you. And just as your tight-knit law enforcement family feels the recent losses to your core, our Nation grieves alongside you. Any attack on police is an unjustified attack on all of us.\nI've spent a lot of time with law enforcement over the past couple of weeks. I know that you take each of these tragedies personally, and that each is as devastating as a loss in the family. Sunday's shooting in Baton Rouge was no different. Together, we mourn Montrell Jackson, Matthew Gerald, and Brad Garafola. Each was a husband. Each was a father. Each was a proud member of his community. And each fallen officer is one too many. Last week, I met with the families of the Dallas officers who were killed, and I called the families of those who were killed in the line of duty yesterday in Baton Rouge. I let them know how deeply we ache for the loss of their loved ones.\nSome are trying to use this moment to divide police and the communities you serve. I reject those efforts, for they do not reflect the reality of our Nation. Officer Jackson knew this too, when just days ago he asked us to keep hatred from our hearts. Instead, he offered—to protestors and fellow police officers alike—a hug to anyone who saw him on the street. He offered himself as a fellow worshipper to anyone who sought to pray. Today, we offer our comfort and our prayers to his family, to the Geralds and the Garafolas, and to the tight-knit Baton Rouge law enforcement community.\nAs you continue to serve us in this tumultuous hour, we again recognize that we can no longer ask you to solve issues we refuse to address as a society. We should give you the resources you need to do your job, including our full-throated support. We must give you the tools you need to build and strengthen the bonds of trust with those you serve, and our best efforts to address the underlying challenges that contribute to crime and unrest.\nAs you continue to defend us with quiet dignity, we proclaim loudly our appreciation for the acts of service you perform as part of your daily routine. When you see civilians at risk, you don't see them as strangers. You see them as your own family, and you lay your life on the line for them. You put others' safety before your own, and you remind us that loving our country means loving one another. Even when some protest you, you protect them. What is more professional than that? What is more patriotic? What is a prouder example of our most basic freedoms—to speech, to assembly, to life, and to liberty? And at the end of the day, you have a right to go home to your family, just like anybody else.\nRobert Kennedy, once our Nation's highest-ranking law enforcement official, lamented in the wake of unjust violence a country in which we look at our neighbors as people \"with whom we share a city, but not a community.\" This is a time for us to reaffirm that what makes us special is that we are not only a country, but also a community. That is true whether you are black or white, whether you are rich or poor, whether you are a police officer or someone they protect and serve.\nWith that understanding—an understanding of the goodness and decency I have seen of our Nation not only in the past few weeks, but throughout my life—we will get through this difficult time together.\nWe will do it with the love and empathy of public servants like those we have lost in recent days. We will do it with the resilience of cities like Dallas that quickly came together to restore order and deepen unity and understanding. We will do it with the grace of loved ones who even in their grief have spoken out against vengeance toward police. We will do it with the good will of activists like those I have sat with in recent days, who have pledged to work together to reduce violence even as they voice their disappointments and fears.\nAs we bind up our wounds, we must come together to ensure that those who try to divide us do not succeed. We are at our best when we recognize our common humanity, set an example for our children of trust and responsibility, and honor the sacrifices of our bravest by coming together to be better.\nThank you for your courageous service. We have your backs.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-07-18", "title": "Letter to the Nation's Law Enforcement Community on the Shootings of Law Enforcement Officers in Dallas, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117928", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:14 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Before we get started I do want to do a brief statement at the top.\nYou will recall that when Republicans took the majority in the Senate in November of 2014, Leader McConnell penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, noting that under Republican leadership, now we can get Congress moving again. Instead, Leader McConnell, Chairman Grassley, and the Senate Republican caucus are setting records for inaction as they fail to fulfill even their most basic constitutional responsibilities.\nToday marks 125 days since President Obama fulfilled his constitutional responsibility and nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is somebody who has more federal judicial experience than any other nominee in Supreme Court history. He is somebody who the nonpartisan American Bar Association voted unanimously to give their highest rating. And he is someone who Republican Senator Orrin Hatch has described as a consensus nominee.\nNow, despite Chief Judge Garland's extraordinary qualifications, Republicans in the Senate have refused to do their job. And Chief Judge Garland's nomination has now been pending longer than any Supreme Court nominee in history whose nomination was not otherwise withdrawn.\nAs the President wrote this week in his own op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, filling a vacancy to the Supreme Court should be bigger than a political party or politics in general. It's about our democracy and the integrity of the institution of the United States Supreme Court.\nThat's why the President lent his support to an idea that his predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, also supported -- namely, that the Senate should commit to giving qualified Supreme Court nominees a hearing and a vote within an established time frame. As the President wrote, \"This reasonable proposal would prevent the confirmation process from breaking down beyond repair, and help restore good faith between the two parties.\"\nSo it's a bipartisan proposal that we would strongly urge Senate Republicans to consider as they enjoy the first week of their seven-week recess.\nSo, with that, Kevin, do you want to get started?\nQ: Thank you. Josh, the administration has been very adamant about how the President has repeatedly made clear his support for law enforcement. Is his open letter to police a sign that the message, for whatever reason, wasn't getting through enough?\nMR. EARNEST: No, Kevin, I think in part because the language of the letter is entirely consistent with what the President has been saying about his support for law enforcement not just in the last few weeks but the last few years.\nQ: My question is why did he feel the need --\nMR. EARNEST: Because he wanted to make clear, particularly at this time when we know that the law enforcement communities across the country are grieving the loss of their colleagues that have been taken in such tragic fashion the last week and a half. The community is hurting right now. And the President felt it was important for them to hear from the President and understand that the President has their back and the rest of the American people have their back. And this was a particular poignant time to deliver that message.\nQ: There were a couple of lines in Melania Trump's convention speech last night that sounded similar to Mrs. Obama's speech in 2008. How does the White House view this? Was it coincidence, the sincerest form of flattery? Or does it even go so far as plagiarism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there certainly has been a lot of color commentary about yesterday's Republican convention. And I'm going to largely let others weigh in with their view on the variety of questions that were prompted by a variety of the speeches yesterday.\nAs it relates to Mrs. Trump's speech, I'll let all of you weigh in on that and try to learn more about how exactly it was written. What I can say is that in 2008, when Mrs. Obama spoke at the Democratic convention, she received an enthusiastic reception and strong reviews because of her words, her life story, and the values that she and her husband deeply believe in and try to instill in their kids.\nThese are American values that we all strive for when we're at our best. And I'll add, they're the same values -- integrity and hard work -- that President Obama expects of everybody who works at the White House. And he's led by example. These are the kinds of values that have animated his two terms as President.\nUltimately, when it comes to our politics, what matters most is the agenda that's put forward to advance these values and instill them in the next generation. And in November, the American people will get to decide who's best suited to do that as the next President of the United States.\nRoberta.\nQ: Can you tell us whether the President or Mrs. Obama watched the speech last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that -- I haven't spoken to the First Lady today. The President did not watch the Republican convention last night, but he obviously is aware of the news coverage that Kevin was referring to.\nQ: And do you know whether Mrs. Obama has any reaction to the speech or the charges of plagiarism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I'll let her speak for herself, but I think that -- let me say that I'm quite confident that she agrees with the sentiment of the response that I just relayed to Kevin.\nQ: I want to ask about the Olympics. Does the White House believe that Russia should be banned from the Rio Olympics over doping?\nMR. EARNEST: The U.S. government does not have a position on Russia's participation in the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee and the relevant governing bodies of individual competitions will have to make those kinds of decisions. Obviously they're reacting to a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency. That is an independent body; that is not a U.S. government agency. There are a substantial number of countries that are represented on that body and I do believe that the United States has one representative on that body. But that is an international organization that was formed to enforce rules and ensure fair competition. That obviously is -- that notion of fair competition is obviously something I think that all Americans and, frankly, most people around the world strongly support.\nBut even that report that was generated by the World Anti-Doping Agency is one that belongs to them, not to the U.S. government. So, ultimately, they'll all have to make some decisions about what impact that has on the Olympic Games and Russia's participation in them. But there's no official U.S. government position on it.\nMichelle.\nQ: When you say that the President is aware of the news coverage surrounding the convention, what is his reaction to it? I mean, what a number of outlets, including us, have been doing is showing them side by side, and the similarities are remarkable. And in some cases, it's word for word. So what is his reaction about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did speak to him this morning. I didn't get a specific reaction to convey to you. Again, I think it's fair to say that what I described to Kevin about the First Lady's speech in 2008 -- how enthusiastic the crowd was about her speech and, frankly, how strong the reviews were of her speech -- were an indication that her words and her values and her life story is quite powerful. And they're also consistent with the kinds of values that I think most Americans subscribe to. And, ultimately, it's those kinds of values that will be at least a part of the decision-making process that American voters will have to make later this year.\nQ: In talking to him about this, though, can you at least describe his demeanor? Was he amused by this? Was he surprised?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I have much of a description of his demeanor to relate at this point. Presumably, at some point, he'll be asked to discuss this and I'll let him do that in a way that he chooses.\nQ: So I know you said he didn't watch this speech, but did he watch any of the convention itself, and does he plan to?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that he watched any of the convention coverage last night. I don't know that he expects to watch much of the convention, but we'll keep you posted.\nQ: I mean, obviously there was a lot said in the course of the day yesterday, but one of the things we heard kind of in different forms a number of times, but also very specifically from Rudy Giuliani, was that a vast majority of Americans don't feel safe. What do you think of that statement? And do you think that that is true right now for whatever reason?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it was -- I did hear some of Mayor Giuliani's speech yesterday. I guess it was difficult to not hear -- (laughter) -- given the volume at which it was delivered. But I'll let other people sort of assess the effectiveness of his delivery. I think what you've heard me acknowledge and what the President I think has acknowledged over the last couple of weeks is the kind of violence that we've seen in our streets is unsettling and there's obviously been a lot of debate about what we can do about it. And I think the President continues to be confident, however, that even in these unsettling moments that our country is far more united than it might seem.\nAnd the kinds of divisions that are on display in our political system aren't reflective of the unity that I think most Americans feel, particularly when it comes to our common values. And all of that was on display in the reaction that we've seen to much of this violence. Americans of all races were deeply disturbed by the killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge over the last week and a half. You've seen strong expressions of support, even from people who have been protesting about isolated incidents of police misconduct, saying that they condemn this violence targeting police officers. Even they have made clear that it's unjustifiable.\nAt the same time, we've seen Americans of all races express concern about the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system and about some of the footage of interactions between law enforcement and African American men in the last couple of weeks that have also involved some violence.\nSo, again, the reaction to these events, while these events themselves are unsettling, the President actually would use the reaction to these events as clear evidence the country is far more united than it might seem.\nQ: Unity and united -- we've been hearing those words a lot. So what I'm trying to get at is, does the administration believe that the vast majority of Americans does not feel safe, does feel safe? I mean, do you think that that statement is wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let other people assess the claims of Mayor Giuliani. I think the President spent a lot of time talking over the last couple of weeks about his view of the current situation, and I think the President has tried to work quite constructively over the last couple of weeks to address it, both substantively in terms of having conversations with law enforcement leaders and civil rights leaders to work on some specific solutions that can be used to address the situation, but the President has also been interested in a broader conversation, including the one that was aired on primetime television last week to try to help people with different perspectives open their hearts to the views of people who might disagree with them. And that will be an important part of making progress to address some of these situations.\nQ: One of the headliners last night said during an interview that President Obama is absolutely a Muslim, in his opinion. What do you think that this is the sort of statement that's being made on the first night of the convention?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't make much of those claims.\nAngela.\nQ: You said yesterday that President Obama and President Erdogan would likely talk on the phone soon. Has that conversation happened yet?\nMR. EARNEST: It did. It occurred this morning. The President did have a conversation with his Turkish counterpart, President Erdogan. I would anticipate we'll get you a more formal readout of the call early this afternoon if we can get it done. But I had an opportunity to talk to the President about his phone call as well. I can tell you that the President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened. The President's expectation is that people in Turkey are -- want to see a full investigation and accountability for those who are complicit in the failed coup.\nThe President also believes that that investigation should be conducted consistent with the democratic principles that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution, and that includes a commitment to due process; that includes a commitment to the basic rights that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution like freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly.\nUltimately, those are the values that the Turkish people were defending in repelling the coup. And I think one good piece of evidence of that is you promptly saw statements from all of the parties represented in the Turkish parliament condemning the attempted military overthrow of the civilian government. That was a sentiment expressed by the leaders of political parties who have vigorous political disagreements with the current civilian government. So the Turkish government's and the Turkish people's commitment to democracy is strong. And the principles of democracy should be adhered to, even as a thorough investigation is conducted.\nQ: Did the President express any concerns that those principles of democracy might not be adhered to as the investigation goes forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is mindful of the fact that just three or four days ago, we saw a NATO ally whose democratically elected government was threatened by some components of their military. That's going to prompt some uneasiness and some tension. It's going to put people on edge. That's understandable. But it's in times like these that it's particularly important for the Turkish government and the Turkish people to adhere to the principles of democracy that they've been fighting for and that they're justifiably proud of.\nSo it's not the first time that the President had the occasion to discuss with President Erdogan the importance of adhering to democratic principles, but the heightened anxiety in Turkey is certainly justified, given the events of the last several days there. But it's important for leaders in the Turkish government and leaders in Turkish society to demonstrate continued commitment to these democratic principles.\nQ: Did they discuss in the call Fethullah Gьlen? And, if so, was there any formal extradition request issued by the Turkish government?\nMR. EARNEST: The status of Mr. Gьlen was discussed on the call. I can tell you that also earlier this morning, separate from the phone call, there were materials presented by the Turkish government in electronic form to the U.S. government related to Mr. Gьlen's status. And the Department of Justice and the Department of State will review those materials, consistent with the requirements of the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey that's been on the books for more than 30 years now.\nBut the President also made clear a couple of other things. The first is that the United States doesn't support terrorists. The United States doesn't support individuals who conspire to overthrow democratically elected governments. The United States follows the rule of law. And as it relates to Mr. Gьlen's status, there is a process that is established in the extradition treaty that we will follow. There also is due process to which people who live in the United States are entitled. And we'll make sure that that due process is followed as well.\nThe decision about Mr. Gьlen's status and the decision to extradite him is not a decision that is made by the President of the United States. It is a legal decision that is made pursuant to a legal process, part of which is codified in a longstanding treaty between the United States and Turkey. So that's the process that we'll follow.\nAgain, I can't say definitively at this point that a formal request has been made. We're still reviewing the materials that were submitted by the Turkish government, and we'll do that consistent with the process that's been established both in U.S. law and in the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, just to be clear, the documents received today don't yet count as a formal extradition request, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to put it bluntly, they're still reviewing the materials to determine if they do qualify as a specific formal extradition request. They were received just a couple hours before I walked out here.\nThe thing that's a little complicated about this is we typically do not discuss publicly many details related to extradition requests. So I don't know that, moving forward, I'm going to have a whole lot of information that we'll be able to provide about the process. But given the discussion that we had yesterday about the fact that we had not received a formal extradition request, I want to be sure to explain to you where that process currently stands. I don't know, however, that we'll be able to provide a daily update on the status of this process.\nQ: Well, can you understand -- help us understand a little bit the process here. When you say it is a \"legal matter,\" is it not correct to say, then, that diplomatic considerations will come into play here? That that state will also get to weigh in on whatever Justice comes down on?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that the process is quite complicated, but the way that it's been described to me is essentially there are a couple of tracks. The first is there is a review of the request, if one has been received, both by the United States Department of Justice and by the Department of State. And that is, of course, related to both U.S. law and the due process that individuals who live in the United States are entitled to. But it's also to ensure that that process is consistent with the steps that are laid out in the extradition treaty between our two countries.\nThe other part of this process is that -- I made a reference to it in the context of the due process that's afforded individuals living in the United States, which is there is a role for a federal judge here as well.\nSo it's complicated. That's basically the extent of my knowledge of this process. And, again, I don't expect, moving forward, to be able to provide a day-to-day accounting of where things stand, but that's the direction that we're headed. But all of that is, of course, contingent on the review of the materials that have been received.\nQ: But obviously Turkey's status, being that they are a NATO ally, their importance to this country and our fight against ISIS would come into some consideration in some way, even if it's just states versus the federal judge and DOJ.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is a pretty well-established process here, and so I don't know that there is -- I don't, frankly, know how much room there is for any discretion that could be exercised based on diplomatic sensitivities. That may be a technical question that's better directed to the State Department.\nQ: Question for you. In the phone call that the President had with Mr. Erdogan -- you talked yesterday about the need for restraint. You used that word over and over again, saying that was the President's message. We've seen 15,000 members of the Education Ministry dismissed, 3,000 from the judiciary, I don't even know how many from the military. Does that constitute restraint?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think I tried to address this in part of my answer to Angela. The situation in Turkey is tense right now. You saw elements of the Turkish military use the equipment of the Turkish military to attempt to overthrow the civilian democratically elected government of Turkey. Innocent people died in that effort. And at this point, we don't know precisely the scope of that effort. We don't know how many people were involved. And that's something that Turkish officials are obviously working quickly to try to determine. They want to get to the bottom of what happened.\nI think the Turkish people have an expectation that it's worth getting to the bottom of what happened. After all, it is their government, the government that they voted for, the government that they elected that was threatened. And there are innocent civilians in Turkey who lost their lives in the effort to overthrow it. So there's a genuine public interest in getting to the bottom of what happened. But even in times like these -- especially in times like these -- it's important to demonstrate a commitment to the well-established democratic traditions and practices of the Turkish government, and a commitment to those principles that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution is important.\nAfter all, it is a testament to the strength of Turkey's democracy that this coup attempt failed and you saw the political parties come together in condemning it. You saw the Turkish people come out on the streets to express their opposition to it. The leaders of that democratically elected government have a responsibility to adhere to those principles, especially in times like these.\nQ: It sounds like you're saying it's not exactly like what we wanted to see. It doesn't look like the restraint we're calling for.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I'm indicating is that the events that we saw in Turkey on Friday night -- I think it's hard for us to put ourselves in the place of the Turks. I think the one thing we can acknowledge is that a military action like that would be deeply unsettling to the government and to the population. But the only reason that effort failed is directly related to the strength of the Turkish people's commitment to democracy and the strength of Turkey's democratic institutions. And the strength of the commitment of political leaders to the notion of democracy, even in the face of some profound political disagreements.\nSo this is a particularly important time for the Turkish government and the leaders of Turkey to adhere to the principles of democracy and support the democratic institutions and traditions of the Turkish government.\nDavid.\nQ: Josh, you said the President did not watch the Republican convention last night. Why not? Is there something he was doing that was taking his time last night, or was he watching something else? I'm curious.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't speak to the President directly about what exactly he was doing last night. But knowing his habits, I\nexpect that he was working in the private residence and had sports on television, not politics.\nQ: Does he think that the American public should watch the Republican convention? I mean, this is a showcase for what a good-sized portion of the country believes in, to some degree, a discussion of ideas about where the country should go. Does he believe the general public should tune into this, and even Democrats who don't necessarily agree with the party?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, based on the limited portion of the convention that I watched last night, that sounds like a rather generous description of what transpired on television. But I'll let other people speak to that.\nLook, I think the President does believe that it's important for people to be engaged in the political process. And the President does believe that it's important for people to be informed about the issues that our government is confronting and about the people who are aspiring to lead the government or at least have leadership positions in the government. So that said, there are a lot of ways that voters can educate themselves about the process that aren't just limited to watching the Republican convention.\nQ: I think tonight you'll have several of the elected officials, top Republicans in Washington speaking, I believe -- House Speaker and the Majority Leader. Would the President tune in for that? Does he believe at least that that is something that's maybe more worthwhile than say the roster last night?\nMR. EARNEST: It's possible. I don't know what the President's plans are for tonight. I'm confident that even if he doesn't watch the speeches, he will certainly be interested in the news coverage of them. So I don't mean to put additional pressure on you guys but --\nQ: The President may feel like he's heard their arguments, maybe this is overheated rhetoric, which he sort of alluded to a few days back that could be coming down the pike. But at the same time, he's talked a lot about having a conversation, listening to each other, making sure that we are hearing, and he probably wants Republicans to tune in when he talks to hear what he has to say. Would you agree with that? And wouldn't it be wise for him to maybe make a point to say I've been watching and listening even if I don't agree?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen. I think tuning in to hear the President of the United States speak I think is different than tuning in to a party convention proceeding. So the President himself will be delivering a message to the Democratic convention next week, and that's different than the kind of speech that the President gives, for example, in the East Room of the White House, or in the well of the House of Representatives on the night of the State of the Union.\nQ: -- affect the public attitude when he speaks?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess my point is, I think the President would understand if there are partisan Republicans who chose not to tune in to watch him deliver a speech to the Democratic convention. I do think the President is hopeful that they'll read news coverage about it, that they'll make an effort to understand exactly what message the President was hoping to deliver. And I think the President walks the walk when it comes to that advice, based on his own consumption of the news.\nAnd I guess I also want to be clear, the President is not making some principled statement, registering some kind of protest by not watching the Republican convention. I think he is merely making a choice about how to spend the small amount of free time he has in the evening. And his preferences tend toward the athletic as opposed to the political.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to rehear the immigration case, the 4-4 split on the President's immigration actions, and acknowledged that it was a long shot that the Supreme Court would review this case. So given that, is it an effort to put the spotlight on the vacancy and Merrick Garland's stalled nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the spotlight was already on the vacancy because the Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision about the administration's executive actions. In this case, the filing from the Department of Justice is merely an effort to pursue every available legal avenue because we believe in the power of the legal argument in support of the President's executive actions.\nSo how that is going to move forward, I'd refer you to the office of the Acting Solicitor General. But we continue to have confidence in the power of our legal arguments, and we're going to make them in every available venue.\nQ: And can you give us just some more guidance on the agenda for the meeting today with the Attorney General?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is an opportunity for the President and senior officials at the Department of Justice. I'd just note that we also expect that the Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, will also participate in that meeting. I think the President is interested in understanding what more we can do to protect our law enforcement officers. And he's also interested in furthering the discussion that has involved Director Comey, Attorney General Lynch, and Secretary Johnson about how to strengthen the bonds of trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities across the country that they're sworn to serve and protect.\nAnd in too many of those communities, we've seen those bonds of trust start to fray. And that ultimately makes law enforcement less effective. It only increases the risk that law enforcement officers face, and it ends up potentially, in some cases, making the streets more dangerous for the people who live in these communities. So it's a cycle that we need to reverse because we know that there is a virtuous cycle that we can benefit from. When law enforcement agencies are able to effectively work with community leaders to restore some trust that has the effect of improving the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they're sworn to serve and protect. Tensions subside. And ultimately, those stronger relationships make it easier for law enforcement officers to do their job. It makes them safer and more effective in fighting crime, which ultimately leads to a reduction in crime and makes the community and the streets a little safer.\nSo that's the dynamic that the President and Director Comey, Attorney General Lynch and Secretary Johnson are interested in creating. And they'll have a discussion on how to do that in the Oval Office.\nQ: Will Director Comey be there as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Director Comey will be there as well.\nHans.\nQ: If I could just go back to plagiarism. Your answer seemed to be focused on process and the integrity you thought was in the White House. Could you give me a sense of your level of certainty -- if you are, indeed, certain -- that the President hasn't lifted passages from predecessors?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Hans, we obviously go to great lengths to make sure that something like that doesn't happen. And so there's a thorough vetting process in place here at the White House to ensure the accuracy of the President's words, and also if there are quotes that are included in the President's speeches or other sources of inspiration, that they're properly given credit in his speeches.\nSo the President obviously -- I don't see Dr. Kumar here today, but she's got lots of statistics about how frequently the President has spoken in public. So we obviously have safeguards in place to prevent that kind of things from happening.\nQ: Is that 100 percent certainty, or 99, or 95?\nMR. EARNEST: I've got a lot of confidence in our process.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea, yesterday North Korea launched three ballistic missiles into its east coast near South Korea. Would you please comment on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can confirm that U.S. Strategic Command systems detected and tracked what we assess were three North Korea missile launches yesterday. The United States strongly condemned this and North Korea's other recent missile tests, all of which violates U.N. Security Council resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Korea's launches using ballistic missile technology.\nThis provocation only serves to increase the international community's resolve to countering the DPRK's prohibited activities, including through implementing existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. I'm confident that the United States will continue to engage our partners in the region, including not just our allies, Japan and South Korea, but even countries like Russia and China that are also concerned about North Korea's destabilizing actions.\nThe United States has been able to work effectively with our partners in the region to apply significant pressure to the North Korean regime. But ultimately, it has not led to the kind of strategic change in direction that we hoped and we continue to hope that they will pursue.\nBut what's clear is that North Korea is isolated like never before. The international community is united like never before. And hopefully that will lead to a situation where North Korea makes a strategic decision to come out of the shadows of the international community and try to rejoin the international community. But before we can do that, they're going to have to make a clear commitment to ending these kinds of provocations and abiding by the nuclear -- I'm sorry -- by the U.N. Security Council resolutions that govern both their nuclear weapons program and their ballistic missile program.\nQ: Do you think it is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolution?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. This test is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea's launches using ballistic missile technology.\nQ: There will be another sanction, or other --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I'm not able to preview what sort of response, but I'm confident that this is something that we'll be discussing through diplomatic channels both at the United Nations and in the region.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. How concerned would the President be knowing that if Gьlen were to be extradited he might face certain death?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the decision about this extradition, if and when we receive a formal request from the Turkish government, will be driven by the legal process that is codified both in U.S. law and in the treaty between the United States and Turkey that was signed more than 30 years ago. There's a well-established process for evaluating all of this, and ultimately as it proceeds, there is the possibility that a federal judge would ultimately be called upon to weigh some of these considerations as well.\nSo we intend to pursue that process both because of our commitment to fulfilling our responsibilities that are codified in the treaty, but also because of what President Obama told President Erdogan earlier this morning, which is that the United States doesn't support terrorists and it doesn't support people who conspire to overthrow democratically elected governments, but we are interested in making sure we're following the law and that people who live in the United States are afforded the due process that they're entitled to. And so we're committed to that process as well.\nQ: Are you familiar with the story out of Germany about the axe-wielding person -- some madman apparently attacked a bunch of people? I'm just curious, what lessons, if any, can the U.S. draw from that axe attack on the German train by what I believe was an Afghan refugee?\nMR. EARNEST: We're still learning the details of that particular situation. Based on the most recent reports that we saw, that I've been briefed on at least, the only death that resulted was of the -- was the axe-wielding individual who was confronted by German police officers. So we are obviously relieved that there was no further loss of life.\nIt's hard to draw any clear connections until we learn more about the precise status of the individual involved and the circumstances of this particular incident. I think what it might -- what it could potentially be a good illustration of is the importance of ensuring that there are rigorous screening measures in place before individuals are granted refugee status in the United States, regardless of where they originate from.\nIn fact, refugees attempting to enter the United States are subjected to more rigorous scrutiny and background checks than any other individual attempting to enter into the United States. And that is something the President believes is in place for good reason. And even as we have sought to increase the number of refugees that are admitted into the United States in fiscal year 2016, the President has made clear to his team that he's not willing to cut any corners when it comes to our security. And he's confident that his team understands that and will pursue this role of taking in more refugees than we have in the past consistent with the imperative of not cutting corners when it comes to security.\nQ: Last one. I wanted to kind of circle back on Hans's question earlier. You would acknowledge that sometimes in the process of a campaign, speeches are given where bits and pieces may have been -- for lack of a better description -- borrowed, taken, plagiarized, some would say. Have you ever worked on a campaign where there's been an accusation where a candidate you worked for said, oh, well, that's sounds a lot like candidate A or B from years previous? This sort of thing does happen on occasion, does it not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I was reminded this morning that there was a situation in 2008, I believe, where someone pointed out to then Senator Obama that some of the rhetoric that he was using was similar to rhetoric that then --\nQ: John Edwards.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it was then Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick had used. And the President acknowledged that they had discussed that language and that that was -- that the President had, in fact, been inspired by Governor Patrick to incorporate some of that language into his stump speech and into some of the arguments that he was making.\nBut again, I guess the point is, when asked, the President thought it was important to give credit to his friend, Deval Patrick, who had been a source of inspiration to him. Again, I can't really speak to the process that was undertaken by any of the people who delivered speeches last night.\nQ: If you were in that camp and that happened -- for those of us who haven't worked on a major campaign like at that level -- and it came out minutes later that the speech was given, warmly received, and had passages that were apparently borrowed from another speech -- would heads roll immediately? Tell me what that process would be like.\nMR. EARNEST: It's hard to imagine exactly what the reaction would be. But, look, the --\nQ: You've been in that position where -- tell me what we happen.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure there are plenty of people who are eager to offer the Trump campaign some advice today, but I'm not one of them. And I'm sure they don't really want it either.\nQ: No, no, I meant more like would there be screaming in the background? Would somebody -- would you hear from the candidates themselves? What would that be like?\nMR. EARNEST: It's hard to say. I can't recall that I've been in that situation.\nDave.\nQ: In the spirit of belaboring the point -- (laughter) --\nMR. EARNEST: Occupational hazard.\nQ: Why did you remind us that Michelle Obama's speech in '08 was very popular?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess because -- I think the point that I'm trying to make is simply that the reason that Mrs. Obama's speech -- based on my recollection -- was so well received by people in the audience and so strongly reviewed by the pundits and political observers is that she spoke eloquently. She talked a lot about her powerful personal story, but she also was focused on core American values that are widely shared all across the country. Values like integrity and hard work are values that most people deeply believe in and aspire to. These are the values that we're thinking about when we are trying to be our best. And the President certainly holds everyone who works here at the White House to a high standard when it comes to those values. The President holds himself to a high standard when it comes to those values. And the President and First Lady have certainly worked to instill those values in their kids.\nAnd the next President is going to have to put forward an agenda, and when they do, I think the American people will assess to what extent their agenda would advance those kinds of values.\nSo I think the point is that these are values that are shared by people across the country, regardless of political party. And we've been talking a lot in here over the last couple of weeks about our dysfunctional political system and how divided our country may or may not be. And, look, I think in some ways, last night was clear evidence that there is very strong bipartisan support for those kinds of values.\nQ: Would you agree with me that a speech that turns out to be a dud is less likely to be imitated?\nMR. EARNEST: Assuming you're making rational decisions, yes, I would agree with that notion.\nQ: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: John.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. After an investigation, the Office of Special Counsel determined that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Julian Castro, violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their official authority or influence to affect the outcome of the election. I read the statement that your office put out as it relates to this, and it doesn't sound like there's going to be any punishment for Secretary Castro for violating the Hatch Act. Did I read that correctly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, I saw the statement from Secretary Castro, who acknowledged the inadvertent error. And he indicated that he would participate in some additional training and get an additional briefing to make sure that when he's doing interviews in the future that he understands what the Hatch Act requires.\nSo, look, I think to his credit, Secretary Castro acknowledged the mistake that he made. He owned up to it, and he's taken the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again. I think that's the expectation that people have when you make a mistake, particularly in a situation like this.\nQ: As you know, Secretary Castro is a very intelligent person -- he went to Stanford, Harvard Law School. And in the report that the Office of Special Counsel put out, they write, \"Since beginning his appointment in July, 2014, Secretary Castro has received four briefings on the Hatch Act, including one in February, 2016. But ethics officials advised him that when speaking in his official capacity as Secretary, his appearance must remain official and not become political. An ethics official,\" the report continues, \"testified that they specifically advised Secretary Castro how to handle political questions when he is speaking in his official capacity by stating that he is not there to talk politics.\"\nAnd so my question is, how does Secretary Castro make a mistake like this? And how is that an official in his capacity is not, it seems to me, punished in any way for violating a federal law, the Hatch Act?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, John, I think one thing it does do is it exposes the hazards of bluntly answering questions that are posed by journalists, a hazard that I'm intimately familiar with.\nSo, look, again, Secretary Castro I think was pretty blunt in his letter about acknowledging that he had made a mistake and taking the kinds of steps to ensure that that mistake wouldn't be repeated. I'm quite confident that when he reads a transcript of the exchange that you and I are having, that it will feel like a punishment.\nQ: It seems to be a pattern, though. Because former Secretary of HHS, Kathleen Sebelius, also was found to have violated the Hatch Act. Do you see this as a pattern in the Obama administration, where administration officials -- very senior-level administration officials -- are violating a federal law that exists in this regard?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think it's a pattern at all. I'm not aware of the details of Secretary Sebelius's case that you're referencing.\nQ: And one final question. Do you think it should be disqualifying for an individual to be put on a presidential ticket if they violated federal law?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I'm going to leave it to both candidates. Obviously, one candidate has already decided about who he believes should serve with him on the ticket. And so as it relates to the decision that Secretary Clinton still has to make about who should be added to her ticket, she's getting plenty of advice from people, and I'll let her make that decision.\nPaul.\nQ: Thank you very much, Josh. In the eight or nine months since the President killed Keystone, gasoline prices have fallen or stayed pretty stable, sort of undercutting one of the arguments that the supporters of Keystone always -- they said we need this to lower gasoline prices. To what extent does the administration feel perhaps validated by the fact that those predictions did not come true? And I have a follow-up.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that validated it, to be blunt with you. I think you've heard the President say on a number of occasions that his expectation is that at some point, the continued growth of the global economy will put some upward pressure on gas prices.\nSo the President certainly has offered people advice, suggesting that they should enjoy these historically low gas prices while they last. Some of the price reduction that we have seen is a consequence of a success that we have had in making the country more efficient. As the fuel-efficiency standards that the President put in place early in his first term take effect, that will gradually improve the efficiency of the U.S. auto fleet. That's going to -- that will put some downward pressure on prices because, obviously, demand will be a little lower.\nBut the conclusion about the Keystone pipeline was driven by factors other than the price of gas. I recognize that that was an argument that was made by some of the proponents of the pipeline, but ultimately the decision that was made by the State Department and ultimately supported by the President was a decision that was related to climate change and what approving the pipeline would say about our country's commitment to the low-carbon economy of the future.\nQ: Shifting gears, on Russia, the sanctions that remain in place against the Kremlin and the low price of oil, the White House has always said that, at some point, President Putin is going to pay a price. How do you explain the 75, 80 percent approval rating that he continues to have?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would assume that those of you who are journalists and come by your skepticism honestly will be particularly skeptical of polling data that emerges from Russia.\nQ: The polls are rigged?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't say that. I think that you all will make your own assessments. The broader argument that we have made is that there's no denying that the Russian economy has been hurt by the sanctions that have been put in place. They've certainly been hurt by lower energy prices as well, but the combination of those two things has had a negative impact on the economy. And the sanctions that were put in place against Russia have impeded their ability to response to those low-energy prices in a way that would allow them to try to compensate for them.\nSo the point is, Russia's isolation in this instance has had a negative impact on their economy. And the thought has been that the pressure of that economic isolation could, at some point, prompt President Putin to live up to the commitments that he made in the context of the Minsk agreement. That hasn't happened yet, but we're hopeful that at some point he'll make that decision. Because if he does, the United States and the rest of the international community is prepared to lift those sanctions and give the Russian government and the Russian economy some more flexibility to compensate or at least mitigate some of the weakness that they've sustained as a result of low energy prices.\nQ: Apparently Putin has said that he does not want to be President for life, but he hasn't ruled out running again in 2018. I recognize that's not necessarily this President's problem, but would the White House -- it seems to me it would not be in favor of him running again in 2018. Do you have a position on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, ultimately, we would respect the decisions that President Putin would make with regard to his political future. But beyond that, I don't think I would weigh -- given my hesitance to weigh in on the American presidential election, I'm going to be doubly reticent to weigh in on the Russian presidential election.\nDid you have your hand up earlier?\nQ: Why don't we go back to plagiarism?\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Do you have any background on the '08 speech itself? Those words that seem to have been lifted -- were those written by the First Lady at the time? Do you know?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we acknowledged at the time is that the First Lady worked closely with a team of speechwriters to prepare that speech. Sarah Hurwitz, who actually continues to serve in the First Lady's office as her speechwriter, at that point in time had recently joined the Obama campaign and had been involved in helping the First Lady draft that speech. But certainly that speech reflected the First Lady's values, her life story, and her words, but she certainly did work closely with some very talented speechwriters on her team to perfect it. And she is justifiably quite proud of that speech that she delivered back in July of 2008 -- August of 2008, I suppose.\nQ: On immigration, do you know if President Obama gave the green light so DOJ could file the motion yesterday? I mean, it seems like it could go either way -- you don't know who the judge will be or who will get a judge on the Supreme Court. So it can backfire on the immigration plan.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know whether or not the President signed off on the specific filing. I know the decision was made by the acting Solicitor General. I don't know to what extent the White House was consulted on the legal strategy. My understanding of the situation -- and you should definitely check with the acting Solicitor General on this -- but my understanding is that there was a very narrow window of time in which the Solicitor General could petition to the court for a re-hearing. And, again, that petition was only possible because of the 4-4 deadlock that prevented the Supreme Court from reaching a final decision.\nSo I think in this instance, the conclusion of the Acting Solicitor General, at least, was to pursue every available legal avenue for making this argument. And I don't have a good sense of when we can expect a decision from the Supreme Court about whether to rehear the case, but I'm sure you can get some more details from the Solicitor General's office.\nJ.C., I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Hopefully kind of a fun question. During the speech -- you were involved in the campaign way back -- Eric, a Democratic guy, activist, involved with DCCC, et cetera -- was there a lightbulb moment between you and your staff when you heard Melania's speech last night? I mean, I know people who said, wait a second, this is Mrs. Obama's speech. You guys didn't have to see a parallel in The New York Times or anywhere else between the two speeches. It had to send off some kind of -- did anyone get on the phone and say what is going on? I'm just curious.\nMR. EARNEST: I will admit -- and maybe it's because her speech was delivered late at night, at least past my bedtime -- I did watch her speech, but there were no lightbulbs that went off immediately in my head. It wasn't until I saw the news early this morning that some questions have been raised about it.\nQ: Governor Christie just made a comment earlier that said, hey, 93 percent of the speech was not taken out so it's okay. Do you think 7 percent is a good balance in plagiarism? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's among the many explanations I think that we've seen from the Trump campaign in response to these reports -- again I'll leave it to them to describe -- well, and all of you, I guess -- to describe exactly what may have happened with her speech.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:15 P.M.

Thank you. [applause]\nThank you. All right. Don't eat up my time. Thank you. [laughter]\nI want to thank you all for that very warm welcome. I have to start out by saying one very important thing. I am not politically correct. [cheering]\nAnd I hate political correctness because it is antithetical to the founding principles of this country, and the secular progressives use it to make people sit down and shut up while they change everything . It's time for us to stand up and shout out about what we believe in. [applause]\nYou know, I devoted my career to studying and operating on the human brain. This remarkable organ defines our humanity. It gives us the ability to not only feel and observe, but to reason.\nWhen we elect a president we need to use that power of reasoning to look at their history, their character, what kind of people they really all. It makes all the difference in the world for us. And, it is going to be so critical right now. We must resist the temptation to take the easy way out, and to passively accept what is fed to us by the politically elite and the media because they don't know what they're talking about. They have an agenda. [cheering]\nNow, we must also be weary of the narrative that's being advanced by some in our party. The notion that a Hillary Clinton administration wouldn't be that bad, the effects would only be temporary. You know? [cheering]\nThat it would only last for four, and at most, eight years. They're not using their God-given brain to think about what they're saying because it won't be for eight years because she will be appointing people who will have an affect on us for generations, and America may never recover from that.\nThat's what we have to be thinking about.\nYou know, interestingly enough, we have to start thinking about what would Hillary Clinton do if she was, in fact, the President.\nShe would appoint Supreme Court Justices, she would appoint federal judges, and that would have a deleterious effect on what happens for generations to come. Not only that, but she would continue with a system that denigrates the education of our young people, puts them in a place where they're never going to be able to get a job, where they're always going to be dependent, and where they can, therefore, be cultivated for their votes.\nThis is not what America is all about, this kind of deception. And, this is what we, the people, have the necessary obligation to fight. [cheering and applause]\nNow, one of the things that I have learned about Hillary Clinton is that one of her heroes, her mentors was Saul Alinsky. And, her senior thesis was about Saul Alinsky. This was someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently.\nNot, interestingly enough, let me tell you something about Saul Alinsky. He wrote a book called, \"Rules for Radicals.\" On the dedication page it acknowledges Lucifer, the original radical who gained his own kingdom.\nNow, think about that, this is a nation where our founding document, the Declaration of Independence talked about certain in alienable rights that come from our creator. This is a nation where our Pledge of Allegiance says we are one nation under God. [cheering]\nThis is a nation. [applause]\nThis is a nation where every coin in our pocket, and every bill in our wallet says, \"In God We Trust.\" So, are we willing to elect someone as president who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges Lucifer? Think about that.\nThe secular progressive agenda is antithetical to the principals of the founding of this nation, and if we continue to allow them to take God out of our lives, God will remove himself from us, we will not be blessed, and our nation will go down the tubes. And, we will be responsible for that. We don't want that to happen.\nNow, Donald Trump, he understands this very well. He understands that the blessings of this nation come with the responsibility to ensure that they are available to all, not just a privileged few. This is exemplified by his willingness to take on the establishment against all odds. It is evident in his passion for the American work. It is found in his desire to put his considerable skills to work on behalf of American interests, not his self interests.\nI'm proud to support Donald Trump, an extraordinary business man. The right leader for a time such as this. [cheering]\nBut, you know what? It is not about Donald Trump. It is not about me, it is about we the people, and Thomas Jefferson said that we would reach this point because we the people would not be paying attention, and it would allow the government to grow, to expand, and to metastasize and try to rule us.\nBut, he said that before we turn into something else we the people would recognize what was going on. What we were about to lose, and we would rise up, and we would take control of our nation, and I say now is the time for us to rise up and take America back.

{"author": "Chris Christie", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118044", "text": "Good evening. Good evening.\nI am here tonight not only as the governor of New Jersey, but also as Donald trump's friend for the last 14 years. We are about to be led by not only a strong leader but by a caring, genuine, and decent person.\nGovernor Christie. I'm proud to say that the voice of the people of our nation is being heard in this hall tonight and those voices want Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States. [applause]\nBut everybody, this election is not just about Donald Trump. No, It's also about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nNow, in the past few weeks, we've seen the Justice Department refuse to prosecute her. Over the last eight years, we've seen this administration refuse to hold her accountable for her dismal record as Secretary of State. So, let's do something fun tonight. Tonight, as a former Federal Prosecutor, I welcome the opportunity to hold Hillary Rodham Clinton accountable for her performance and her character. [applause]\nNow… [applause]\nAll right, all right, we're getting there. Give me a few more minutes, we'll get there. [laughter]\nHere's what we're going to do. We're going to present the facts to you. You, tonight, sitting as a jury of her peers, both in this hall and in your living rooms, around our nation. You see, since the Justice Department refuses to allow you to render a verdict, I'm going to present the case now, on the facts, against Hillary Rodham Clinton. [applause]\nNow, she was America's Chief Diplomat. So, let's look around the world at the violence and the danger, today, in every region that has been infected by her flawed judgment. But, I'm going to be specific so that you can render your verdict tonight on the basis of facts.\nLet's go to North Africa. She was the Chief Engineer of the disaster overthrow of Gadhafi in Libya. Libya today, after Hillary Clinton's grand strategy, their economies in ruins, there's death and violence in the streets, and ISIS is now dominating that country. So, I'm going to ask you this. Hillary Clinton, as a failure for ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity for ISIS, answer me now, is she guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. In Nigeria, Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an Al Qaida affiliate off of the terrorist watch list. Now, what happens because of this reckless action by the candidate who is the self-proclaimed champion of women all around the world. These Al Qaida terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young women two years ago. These school girls are still missing today. And what was the solution from the Obama-Clinton team? A hashtag campaign.\nSo, now let's figure it out. Let's decide. Hillary Clinton, as an apologist for an Al Qaida affiliate in Nigeria, resulting in the capture of innocent young women, is she guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. See, she fights for the wrong people. She never fights for us. She doesn't get the real threats that America faces.\nSo, now let's go to China. In China, Hillary Clinton praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance Barack Obama's bloated stimulus plan. She was so desperate for Chinese cash, she promised to oppose the buy American provision in the stimulus bill in exchange for the cash to finance a huge expansion of federal government spending.\nSo, Hillary Clinton, putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of good paying jobs for middle class Americans, is she guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Let's go to Syria. In Syria, imagine this. Imagine this. She called President Assad a reformer. She called Assad a different kind of leader. There's now 400,000 dead. Think about that. Four-hundred thousand dead. At the hands of the man that Hillary defended.\nSo, we must ask this question. Hillary Clinton, as an awful judge of the character of a dictator and butcher in the middle east. Is she guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Next, next in Iran. She launched a negotiations that brought about the worst nuclear deal in history. Let me be clear. America and the world are measurably less safe unless respected because of the Iran deal that Hillary helped cut. Period. After she launched those negotiations, she became the biggest cheerleader for this agreement in the end. It's a deal that will lead to a nuclear Iran. An Israel that will be less safe and secure. And a much more dangerous Middle East.\nSo, let's ask it. Hillary Clinton, as an inept negotiator of the worst nuclear arms deal in American history, is she guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Next, Next. Oh believe me, we're not done yet. The indictment is hardly complete. [applause]\nNext, let's go to Russia. She went to the Kremlin on her very first visit, and gave them that stupid, symbolic reset button. You know what I think that button should have read? It should have read, delete. You know, she's very good at that, by the way. [applause]\nAnd it should have read delete because, she deleted, in four years, the safety and security it took us to build in 40 years. The next year, she said our goal, America's goal was to strengthen Russia. Strengthen an adversary led by a dictator who dreams of reassembling the old Soviet empire. What an extraordinarily dangerous lack of judgment.\nSo, once again, we need to ask, as a flawed evaluator of dictators that failed strategists, who has permitted Russia back in as a major player in the Middle East, is Hillary Clinton guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Now, now, we go to Cuba. Hillary Clinton supported concessions to the Castro brothers, and got almost nothing in return for ending the embargo. She supported a deal that didn't even require this murderous regime to return a cop killer, JoAnne Chesimard to face justice. See, I know about this personally. JoAnne Chesimard murdered a New Jersey state trooper in cold blood, fled to Cuba, and lives there under Cuban protection to this very day.\nI want to ask you. How can someone live with their own conscious when you reward a domestic terrorist with continued safety and at the same time betray the family of a fallen police officer, waiting for decades for justice for his murder? So let's ask the question. Hillary Clinton, as a coddler of the brutal Castro brothers and betrayer of the family of fall state trooper, Werner Foerster and his family. Is she guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Now, finally. Finally, here at home in one of her first decisions as Secretary of State. She set up a private e-mail server in her basement in violation of our national security. Let's face the facts. Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she cared about protecting America's secrets. [applause]\nAnd then, she lied about it, over, and over, and over again. She said, there was no marked classified information on her server. The FBI director said, that's untrue. She said that she did not e-mail any classified information. The FBI Director says, that's untrue. She said, all work-related e-mails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI Director said, that's not true.\nSo, I say, Hillary Clinton, the charge of putting herself ahead of America, guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. I got another question for you. I got another question for you. I say, Hillary Clinton, lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment in making our secrets vulnerable. What's your verdict, guilty or not guilty?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Now, time, time after time after time. The facts and just the facts lead you to the same verdict. Both around the world and here at home. In Libya, in Nigeria, Guilty. In China and Syria.\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. In Iran and Russia and Cuba.\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. And here at home, for risking America's secrets to keep her own and lying to cover it all up?\nAudience. Guilty.\nGovernor Christie. Her focus group tested persona with no genuineness to be found, is a shame. Meant to obscure all the facts and leave you able to vote for her. We cannot promote someone to Commander in Chief who is made the world a more violent and dangerous place with every bad judgment she's made. We cannot make the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United States, someone who has risked America's secrets and lied to the American people about it, day after day after day.\nHere it is everybody. We didn't disqualify Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States, the facts of her life and career disqualify her. [applause]\nSee, I can tell that everybody in this hall agrees with this. But, I want to take our last moments here to talk to all of you at home. In your living rooms, sitting there tonight. You're the one's who will decide this election. We have an alternative. We have a man who is unafraid. We have a man who wants to lead us. We have a man who understands the frustrations and the aspirations of our fellow citizens. We have a man who judges people based on their performance, regardless of your gender, your race, your ethnic or religious background. I implore you. We do not need to settle for less in this election. We can not reward incompetence and deceit. We need to demand more than what Hillary Clinton offers for America. Because see, we know exactly what four years of Hillary Clinton will bring. All the failures of the Obama years, but with less charm and more lies. [applause]\nTonight, those of us in this hall and the people at home. It is our obligation to stop Hillary Clinton now and never let her get within ten miles of the White House again. [applause]\nIt is time to come together and make sure that Donald Trump is the next President of the United States. [applause]\nI am proud to be part of this team. Now let's go out and win this thing together. Let's go get them.\nGood night.", "timestamp": "2016-07-19", "title": "Remarks to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119279", "text": "Today, following the endorsement of UNITE HERE, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:\n\"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of UNITE HERE.\n\"American workers built the greatest middle class in history by fighting for higher wages, safer working conditions, retirement security and the right to organize and bargain collectively. UNITE HERE has been on the front lines for decades, fighting to raise the minimum wage and reform our broken immigration system. They've stood strong to protect the rights and safety of workers across the country—and they've stood up to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who personally signed a contract with a union-busting firm to try to keep UNITE HERE from organizing workers in Las Vegas. I was proud to visit with UNITE HERE workers on the picket line twice in the primary, and I was even prouder when they overcame Trump's intimidation campaign and were officially certified as a union earlier this year.\n\"UNITE HERE knows, as I do, that America is stronger together. Workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work are fundamental to our country and to our economy. In too many statehouses across the country—and even in the halls of Congress—these rights are under concerted attack by Republicans and big corporations who have forgotten that a strong economy requires a strong workforce. If I am elected President, workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House. I'll protect and build upon President Obama's executive actions on immigration and will introduce legislation to at last secure comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship within my first 100 days. And I'll always have workers' backs—because when workers are strong, America is strong.\"", "timestamp": "2016-07-19", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on UNITE HERE Endorsement"}

I am so excited to be here. You all are -- everyone is so excited, it's so cute.\nMRS. OBAMA: They're all excited.\nMR. OAKLEY: Everyone is excited. Like I said, this is the third annual, and it has just gotten bigger and better every year. We have an incredible panel of inspiring people that we will be chatting with all morning. And I got to say, I am I think most excited to see this many people here. There are over 130 college-bound students who have beat the odds, who are redefining success, who are inspiring so many in their own communities. And I just look out into the crowd and I see the future, and that is the coolest feeling. Like I just am giddy.\nSo thank you for indulging me for a second.\nMRS. OBAMA: The future looks good, doesn't it? It looks good.\nMR. OAKELY: Yeah, it's a good look. You all look cute. (Laughter.)\nMS. SCOTT: College looks good on you.\nMR. OAKLEY: So I do see that you all have your phones, so please feel free to tweet with the hashtag #BeatingTheOdds.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah. You guys know how to do that right?\nMR. OAKLEY: Get it trending. I believe in you. And we are actually livestreaming right now from a camera -- there are 30 in the room, but some -- right there. We are livestreaming, so hello to the people watching at home. Thank you for joining us. And tweet along while you're at your computer. I want to know what you all think.\nSo to begin, to kick things off, I think we should maybe introduce ourselves. (Laughter.) Some of you might know some people up here, but why don't we start at the end, maybe -- introduce yourself, what you do, and why do you think it's important for us to be up here sharing our stories and to be here at this event today.\nSECRETARY KING: Hello, everybody. I'm John King, the U.S. Secretary of Education. I'm thrilled to be here, because my job is to make sure that folks get to college, and not just get to college, but through college to graduation. And so I'm here to support you. I think events like today are really important because college -- getting to college and staying in college through to graduation sometimes can be challenging, and sometimes there are obstacles in the way. It can be hard. And it's important for us to all remind each other that success is possible.\nI was a kid who grew up in New York City. I lost both my parents when I was a kid -- my mom when I was eight, my dad when I was 12. And it's only because teachers and mentors convinced me to stay hopeful, convinced me that better things were possible that I'm alive today, that I'm even sitting here today. And so if, together, all of us can send that message to people throughout our society that school can change lives, then this will be a good event.\nSo, thanks. (Applause.)\nJIDENNA: Well, my name is Jidenna. (Applause.) I need to bring you all with me everywhere. (Laughter.) I'm here because I -- when I first came to the U.S. -- I'm originally from Nigeria. And when I --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo!\nJIDENNA: Yeah. (Laughter.) You can always count on Nigerians being everywhere. (Laughter.) When I originally came to the U.S., my mother came with a couple hundred dollars to her name, and we had -- I didn't know we were struggling because she hid that from me. But it was definitely a struggle to get through life and get through school. And the thing that got me to where I am now, though, is not just talent, it's not just a hit record, but it actually was my education.\nThere's not a lot of artists that you know that stay in school, stay through school. And what allowed me to kind of cut through the mold and cut through was my ability to -- I guess all the skills that I learned in school, the ability to present. I have a network now across the music industry and whatnot, and these are things that you don't hear a lot with artists. Often, it's \"dropped out of school, now we're dumb rich.\" (Laughter.) For me, it's a different story.\nAnd so I'm here to kind of share my struggles and share how I got through life. And hopefully, some of you can take a little bit from that story.\nMRS. OBAMA: And, Jidenna, just by the way, where did you got to school?\nJIDENNA: I went to Stanford University. (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: He just left that out.\nMR. OAKLEY: Casual. Super casual.\nMS. SCOTT: Hi, guys. My name is Rachel McKenzie Scott. I'm from Washington State. I currently attend the University of Washington in Seattle. I've been a Washington State foster youth for about seven years. I'm in Washington State's Foster Until 21 program that I voluntarily entered after I turned 18. I entered foster care when I was 12 years old, after the death of my mother and the abandonment by my father.\nMyself and my four other siblings went to different placements, but we all decided to persevere, and the three older of my siblings have all gone to and graduated from college. I'm currently attending, and then my little sister is looking towards attending college not this fall, but the next coming fall.\nAnd so, since being in college, I've done a lot of things, had a lot of experiences. I'm currently studying oceanography and marine biology. I'm working to study ocean conservation and coastal restoration. And so those are just a couple of things I'm working on right now. (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Just a few things. Hi, everybody, I'm Michelle Obama. (Applause.) And welcome to the White House. (Laughter.) Well, I'm here because of you all, and the millions of kids like you all out there in this country -- because I was one of you.\nYou guys probably know my background. I grew up on the South Side of Chicago. My parents didn't go to --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo hoo!\nMRS. OBAMA: South Side, yes! (Laughter.) My parents didn't go to college, and I was one of those kids who was not picked out by my counselors to go to some of the top schools. In fact, when I applied to my alma mater, Princeton, when I was in high school, my counselor told me I was reaching too high. And I know everybody in here has heard something like that before.\nBut I am here today because of my education. I think I'm pretty smart. I think I'm pretty clever. But there's a lot that you hone in on when you finish your education. So there is nothing more important that you all can do for yourselves than get your education, however you have to do it.\nSo we started Reach Higher, we started all these wonderful initiatives because we wanted to make sure that kids like you, who are like me, got all the support that you needed to achieve your dreams. And having you here at the White House is one of greatest honors that we have, because we want to show you just how special you are by giving you a day here with a lot of people and a lot of resources.\nAnd I hope you all listen and take it in, and then come back and keep sharing that story and helping other kids like you do the same thing.\nSo, welcome. It's good to see you guys. You look good. (Applause.)\nMR. OAKLEY: Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm moderating today. My name is Tyler Oakley. I am a YouTuber.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Whoo!\nMR. OAKLEY: Yes, the Internet.\nMRS. OBAMA: Go, Internet. (Laughter.)\nMR. OAKLEY: I grew up in Michigan. I went to Michigan State University. Anybody from Michigan? Hey! Okay. Yes, hello. Go Green, maybe. Or, Go Blue. I don't know. I currently live in L.A. But I wouldn't have been able to do anything that I do now in the creative field had I not gotten my education. And I see a lot of people that might pursue an alternate kind of career, but I still think education got me to where I am today. I studied communication and digital marketing, and I use that every single day of my life. And it's super important. And I thank my educators and I wouldn't be here without them.\nBut moving forward, we want to hear a little bit from you, now that you know a little bit about us. I know that we have questions from all over the country, from you guys, and some from the audience today. So our first question is going to be coming from Sarah Hendricks -- maybe. There you are.\nQ: Mrs. Obama --\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes. (Laughter.)\nQ: What is the best piece of advice you have for a student who will be beginning college in the fall?\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, I have a lot of advice. That's why we're here. (Laughter.) Here's the first thing. Most of you guys will go to a school where they'll have a summer program -- I know I did at Princeton -- and it was a huge advantage. A program where you came on campus a little bit earlier, got to stay in the dorms, take some classes. That was a lifesaver for me, because when I showed up at Princeton's campus I had never been on a college campus in any meaningful way. I never slept in a dorm.\nAre you going to Princeton?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Are you going to the summer program?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Nice. (Applause.) It's going to be a great thing. And now I hear you can get credits for some of the courses. That wasn't true when I was going. You just took the classes.\nBut you got a chance to make friends before the campus got full. You got to learn the campus, meet professors, develop some relationships and some bonds so by the time the campus got full, you guys -- you'll already be set. So I urge you to look into those kind of programs if you haven't. That's one.\nNow, when you get to school and classes start, I want you to take it seriously. So here's what you got to do. You got to go to class. You got to go to class every single day, and be fairly organized. And I want you to think about -- when you think about cutting or sleeping in or skipping -- because nobody is going to be paying any attention to you. Nobody is going to wake you up. Nobody is going to tell you that you missed anything. You're going to feel really free. And when you decide to sleep in, I want you to multiply how much money you're spending by every class you take, and you will see how much money you're wasting.\nPlus, when you miss class things just -- they just build. You get behind a little bit, then you're behind a lot. Then you miss something. You just don't want to let these little-bitty choices pile up on you. So you can't procrastinate in college. Because, again, nobody is going to be checking on you. So you've got to be organized. You've got to do your reading.\nAnd when you think about it, it's all manageable. I mean, you guys are going to have a couple of classes a day maybe a few days a week. I mean -- and the rest of the time, if you're not working -- which I had a work-study job -- but even with that, the rest of the time is yours. You have plenty of time to focus on your studies and get everything done.\nHere's the other thing I'll tell you. Do not be afraid to ask for help. Nobody gets through college on their own. And a lot of kids like us think that somehow, if we need help, that we miss something. But let me tell you, wealthy kids, kids who are used to college, they are so used to asking for help and getting tutors. They are the first ones to be like, Mommy, I need a tutor. And they will get one. We're the ones who sit back and struggle and feel embarrassed because we don't understand something. Ask for help. You will all have great resources, writing support, tutors. Get to know the folks on your campus. And through these summer programs, if you go, you'll get to meet everybody.\nThe last thing I want to say is, many of you, if not most of you, will be on financial aid. Do not just sign up for financial aid. Don't just sign a line. You have to really understand the commitments that you're making. So have somebody read through the paperwork for you. Because when you take out a loan, that's real money that you owe, plus interest. And you don't want to wait until year four, or maybe year five, depending upon what plan you're on, to look back and see how much debt you've accumulated. You should understand the debt that you're taking on and not be surprised at the end.\nAnd your financial aid money is not for stereo equipment, it's not for shoes. Girls, it's not for getting your hair done. Because I know too many -- I was an associate dean at the University of Chicago, and so many first-generation students couldn't finish a semester because they ran out of money. You're going to get a big fat check, and somebody is going to hand it to you, and you're going to put it in the bank. And that doesn't mean you can pay mom's electricity bill or send money home. Because when you spend that money, it's gone. The financial aid folks are not going to give you more money because you misspent it. So you've got to take that seriously. It would be a shame if you didn't finish -- once you got in and did the work, and then you couldn't finish a semester or a quarter because you ran out of money because you didn't many your money.\nSo take your financial aid seriously. Get to know your financial aid counselors. And keep track. And, you guys, this is grown-up time. So it's time to be fully responsible for everything you do. So that's some advice.\nMR. OAKLEY: Great advice.\nMRS. OBAMA: I could obviously go on.\nMR. OAKLEY: Rachel, do you have an advice you want to share? Because you're in the thick of it right now.\nMS. SCOTT: Oh, yes.\nMR. OAKLEY: You are there.\nMS. SCOTT: My biggest piece of advice is a bit of a clichй. I'm sure you've all heard the say, \"don't sweat the small stuff.\" But that is one of the most important things when you begin your first and your second, and I'm coming up on my third year of college -- don't sweat the small stuff. Don't sweat feeling embarrassed because you don't know as much as the other kids. There's opportunities I skipped out on because I was embarrassed that I wasn't as smart as the other kids.\nI grew up in a very small rural town in the northeast corner of Washington State that had less than 200 people in it. I moved schools almost five or six times. I was in speech class up until I was in like fifth or sixth grade, and the only reason I left speech class was because I moved. I had so many gaps in my education, and I was so embarrassed because of it. It wasn't my fault that I was missing education, it was my parents' fault. But I was the one who felt the embarrassment because of it. So I didn't ask for tutors when I needed it, and I didn't ask for an extension on an assignment when I really needed it.\nAnd so don't sweat the small stuff. Don't sweat feeling embarrassed or anything like that. Don't sweat missing a party because you're studying for an exam that you have the next day or two days from now. There will be other parties.\nMR. OAKLEY: There will be more parties. (Laughter.)\nMS. SCOTT: There is. The University of Washington has a very large Greek system, and we have parties on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays. (Laughter.) If it's a holiday, there will be one on Monday. If it's a random day, there will be one on Wednesday. There's at least three or four a week. And I don't even participate because that's not really what I like to do. I like to go hiking and camping and stuff like that. But there will be parties. There will be other parties. There will be bigger parties. There will be smaller parties. Don't sweat missing it. That education that you're getting, the couple more hours that you could study, the better nights sleep that you would get --\nMR. OAKLEY: Sleep, yes.\nMS. SCOTT: -- the money that you would save by not paying for an Uber to get there or whatnot, like, that all matters in the long run. Don't worry about not having your hair done or having nice clothes. Like, I've gone to school in the same pair of yoga pants for like three days in a row because I didn't feel like doing laundry yet, but nobody cares.\nMR. OAKLEY: Don't judge.\nMS. SCOTT: Don't judge! (Laughter.)\nMR. OAKLEY: You will be there.\nMRS. OBAMA: Don't judge. I used to buy underwear because I didn't do my laundry. (Laughter.)\nMS. SCOTT: Those things happen.\nMRS. OBAMA: I used to go -- it's like, I just need seven more days. I'd go buy seven more pairs of underwear. (Laughter.)\nMS. SCOTT: Probably because she was studying and didn't want to do her laundry. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: That's right.\nMS. SCOTT: But don't worry about not having the other clothes, because it was a very hard lesson for me to learn because I grew up very, very poor, like we didn't have money. We went to two different food banks. I used to take all my hand-me-down clothes from my older siblings. Sometimes I didn't know when we were going to eat. We didn't have the best diets. Like, I learned very early on that I didn't have money and that I didn't have as much money as everyone else.\nAnd then eventually I got to high school and I went to a high school that the man who owns Nordstrom, his granddaughter went to my school. And so I was going to school with kids who are so much more wealthy than I might ever be. And I had to learn very quickly that I can't worry about that stuff, because it's not my fault and that stuff doesn't matter in the end. That stuff doesn't build character, so don't sweat not having it. Don't worry about it.\nDon't worry if they make fun of you because you don't have it, because I've faced bullying and a lot of things throughout my life because I was always the weird kid, or I became, at the age of 12, I became the kid with dead parents. And nobody knows how to treat a kid with dead parents, so I just didn't tell people. And I felt embarrassed because nobody remembered how to treat me as a human being. That wasn't a fault of my own. That was a fault of others for not learning to be compassionate and helping someone in times of need.\nSo don't sweat other people, and don't sweat the circumstances. Just focus on you, and focus on getting through college and getting yourself the things that you need to succeed. You need your books. You need your studies. Some of you may need tutors. Some of you may need jobs. Some of you may need financial aid. Work on getting those things.\nAnd once you've found a place of solace and you've found a place where you can be okay, then worry about the other stuff, because that's when you have time. (Applause.)\nMR. OAKLEY: That's great. That's great advice. (Applause.) Our next question comes from another one of you in the audience -- Jasmine Brooks (ph) -- somewhere?\nMRS. OBAMA: Jasmine -- hey, girl.\nMR. OAKLEY: There you are. Hi, Jasmine.\nQ: Hello.\nMR. OAKLEY: A microphone is coming your way.\nQ: My name is Jasmine Brooks, and I am a freshman English major at Fisk University. And my question is for Jidenna. If you could go back to your younger self, what advice would you give him? (Laughter.)\nMR. OAKLEY: Great question.\nJIDENNA: That is a great question.\nMS. SCOTT: I like that giggle right there.\nMRS. OBAMA: Tell us the truth. (Laughter.)\nJIDENNA: You want the truth, Jasmine? All right. Well, I think if I was to go back to my 17-year-old self or 18-year-old self, the one thing that I learned in college actually was that you're going to reach -- you may reach tremendous highs and tremendous lows. I reached rock bottom, like, halfway through college. And it was -- because of all the pressure that I think we're talking about right now -- the pressure to learn how to budget, the pressure to really abandon everything that you ever learned. You don't have a comfort zone anymore. You don't have your neighborhood, you don't have your family with you. You have to figure out for yourself who you are now in two to four years, and then go out in the world and be somebody.\nFor me, I think it was important for me to learn that I needed to take some of that pressure off and just focus on the fact that I believed that I could make it through. That belief is what's going to get you through. However it is -- if it's spiritual for you, if it's a mental thing -- that's going to get you through.\nSo for me, it was that. And I will say that the high point of it was meeting friends that I still have to this day. You will meet the friends that you'll probably have forever. I don't even really talk to some of my high school friends anymore, because the people I met in college were some of the best people I ever met in my life.\nThere's a proverb that says \"You are your friends.\" It's not that you are like your friends -- you literally are your friends. They're mirrors to you. So when we talk about study habits and we talk about proper planning and organization -- just look around at who's around you, and that will tell you where you are in life. If there's something you don't like in your friends, chances are that something is in you.\nAnd the last thing I'll say -- and this is I think the crux and the center point for me in college -- what I'd tell myself again -- and I did follow this advice -- was that you are investing in your future. So college should serve you. You don't serve your college.\nI remember my father didn't want me to be -- I was like, dad -- I was trying to be a rapper and a basketball player, Dad. (Laughter.) And I really was. I was Varsity captain. I thought I had everything going for me. I wasn't listening to nobody. And my dad was like, \"Uh-uh, you can't make money from music. You have to be a doctor, a lawyer, engineer. Something that's going to do something for this world. Music doesn't do anything.\" And I had to fight that -- (laughter) -- his passion, and fight the society that I was from. Because every time my uncle sees me, he would check my backpack for grades. Like, that's Nigerian culture, whether rich or poor. And that's a beautiful part about it, but it also adds to that pressure that I was talking about.\nBut if you really know that success comes to just those who don't give up, that's all it is. Just keep going when you reach that low, and hone in on that purpose. And from there, you'll make it through for sure. That's the advice that I would give myself. And I was lucky enough to receive that advice about halfway through my college career. (Applause.)\nMR. OAKLEY: Our next question comes from Giovanni Mesa. There you are. Hello.\nQ: Good morning. I am Giovanni Mesa, and I live in Los Angeles, and I will be attending Penn State in the fall. (Applause.) Thank you. And my question is for Secretary King. So there are many students that are in college right now and want to finish college, but part of the way through they can't afford it. So are there any ways for, I guess, you or anyone to help those students finish college and achieve that goal? And do you encourage students to continue to apply for scholarships in college?\nSECRETARY KING: It's a great and important question. So let me first say, college is the best investment that you can make. And so it may seem daunting while you're in college, but the lifetime returns are tremendous.\nSecond, you've got to fill out the FAFSA form, right, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Everybody has done that once, but you've got to do it every year. You've got to fill out the FAFSA form because that form is really your access to not only federal financial aid, but also state financial aid, scholarship programs, awards from your university. So you've got to fill that out every year.\nYou've got to get to know the financial aid officer at your college, and you got to ask that same question of the financial aid officer at the college. And then, as you think about student debt -- and some students will have to borrow -- you got to be smart about it. And all the points that the First Lady made about being careful about how much you borrow, and figuring out how you're going to plan to pay that back.\nAnd then know that when you graduate, there's public service loan forgiveness if you choose a career in public service. There's teacher loan forgiveness, and I hope some of you in this room will become teachers and take advantage of that. We also have a program called Income-Driven Repayment, where we cap the amount that you have to pay on your loans at 10 percent of your income.\nSo we're doing a lot of work to try to make sure that college is affordable. But it's worth the investment. And you just got to be aggressive about trying to figure out all the possible sources of funding while you're in school.\nMR. OAKLEY: And one thing I would add is -- I mean, you were talking about it a little bit, of working your way while you're there. You do have some free time, not -- you shouldn't be working more than you're studying. Like, I was a telemarketer. I also was an RA, and being an RA in the dorms will drastically reduce how much you have to pay. So little things like working in the cafeteria. Everybody -- you'll meet some of your best friends there, and that's the best thing. Like, when I was a telemarketer, I met so many of my best friends there because we were all paying our way through college. And so you kind of meet the same people that are in the same boat and help yourself along the way.\nMS. SCOTT: And if I could add one thing, is to read the scholarships you get. So apply for the FAFSA; it's moved to October 1st this year instead of back in the winter time. So you'll most likely get your state need grant. There's the Pell grant that you get from the U.S. government. But if you get any type of scholarship, read what it is.\nAnd so there are certain scholarships that I get that give me a certain amount of money, but then there's a little clause that, if you are still struggling and still need help, then I can contact my financial aid officers who will then contact the person who gave me that scholarship, and maybe -- there's actually a specific scholarship that I get for $2,000. And if I need extra help or funds, there's an extra $1,500 set aside every year just in case I need that money. And I get certain scholarships from places like College Success Foundation.\nAnd so if you get to know the people who give you the scholarships, they're going to be willing to give you more money. And so if for some reason all of my scholarships or financial aid or loans couldn't cover it all, or if I ran out of money partway through a quarter, then I got to know these people, and I networked, and I built relationships, and I could talk to them and be like, hey, I have special circumstances -- I ended up having to pay a hospital bill, or I ended up having to move and pay more rent money than I was used to and didn't budget for that, or there were these bills, x, y, and z that I didn't anticipate -- is there more money that is possibly out there that I could write a scholarship to try and win? Or is there work that I can do for your organization to try and earn that extra money that I needed?\nAnd most of these places will work with you and will help you to get you through college. Because they didn't give you that first bit of money to see you waste it and then drop out of college. They gave you that money because they wanted to see you succeed. And so they still want to see you succeed and they want to see you get all the way through. So just go back and ask.\nMR. OAKLEY: That's great. Our next question comes from Kion Douglas.\nQ: Hello. My name is Kion Douglas with College Summit. And I'm attending Northwest State University in the fall, majoring in optical or electrical engineering. And my question is for Rachel. Why is peer influence so powerful when it comes to academic aspiration and achievement? And how do you handle peer pressure?\nMS. SCOTT: Peer influence is one of the greatest things you'll have to deal with. And usually when you hear people say \"peer pressure,\" you think it's, oh, no, they're trying to get you to do drugs or do bad things, and that's the only kind of peer pressure that exists. But that's completely false. Like Rochelle (ph) brought up earlier, she ended up doing a film thing because her friends tried to get her to do it. Her friends peer-pressured her into trying to do a film thing.\n(End of open press segment.)", "timestamp": "2016-07-19", "title": "Discussion with the First Lady, Secretary of Education John King, Tyler Oakley, Jidenna, and Rachel McKenzie Scott at the Reach Higher Beating the Odds Summit"}

You guys, rest yourselves. You've got some movie-watching to do. I don't want you to get tired. (Laughter.)\nYou guys, welcome so much to the White House. I want to start by thanking Simon, Karl, and Chris for being here, and for their wonderful introduction of me. You guys are generous, compassionate, focused. And it's just -- isn't it cool that they're here? (Laughter.) You guys realize you're about to see them on the -- (laughter) -- you do realize the connection? They are in the movie. They're stars. There are movie stars here. See, I still do this when movie stars show up. I'm like, you're really here! (Laughter.)\nAnd they're actually, like, normal-height people, handsome -- let's just admit it, ladies, they're very handsome, aren't they? (Applause.) I mean, we've got to just let that out. I could tell you wanted to just release that. (Laughter.) But I'm happy that you guys are here.\nI also want to acknowledge our friends at Bad Robot and Paramount who made this all so possible. So let's give them a round of applause. (Applause.) Yes, yes.\nBut I really want to welcome you guys. We've got a good crew here. We've got servicemembers who are here. We have veterans who are here. We have military spouses who are here - woo-hoo, woo-hoo! (Applause.) We have Blue Star families and Gold Star families. And, most importantly, we have the most amazing people on the planet, which are our military kids. (Applause.) I see you! I see you! Don't make him put his hand -- I see you back there, babe.\nNow, I'm not going to talk long, because I know I'm the only thing standing between you and the next installment of the \"Star Trek\" movie. But I just wanted to take a moment just to make sure that you understand why we wanted to do this for you. You guys are some special people. And day in and day out, you serve our country in so many ways -- whether you're in uniform or out of uniform, whether you've just finished a deployment, or whether you're a veteran that's just taken off the uniform -- and you're still finding ways to serve this community and be leaders, and use all that training for the benefit of your neighbors and for this country. Whether you're a military spouse and -- I've come to learn all the challenges you all face -- moving every couple of years, trying to figure out life for your kids, holding down jobs of your own, changing careers -- just maintaining things and doing it all with a smile and all without complaint.\nAnd, of course, we've got our military kids -- kids who we know -- most kids don't know what you go through. The fact that many of you will be at 10, 11, 12 different schools in your lifetime. Every couple years you're making new friends and figuring out how to adjust and trying to make the team and hoping that the AP classes are there, and checking in on your brothers and sisters and holding it down for your parents. I've come to admire our military kids more than you all will know, because you guys are heroes. And the only way your parents are able to serve is because you guys hold it down, and you do it with maturity beyond your years. And that's going to serve you well, even though sometimes it doesn't feel like it, right? It feels pretty hard, but you guys are going to walk away from this experience with a level of compassion and depth and leadership that you don't even know yet. But I've seen it.\nSo whenever we get a chance to thank you and to show how much we appreciate you, we try to. Now, one way we've done it, Jill and I, is by starting Joining Forces. And we've spent the last seven and a half years really trying to follow through on the commitments that we made that we were going to use our platform to lift you guys up every single day.\nAnd as a result of the call to action, people have stepped up. We've hired more veterans and military spouses, we've gotten more support for our military kids in school. And we've gotten the country hopefully to change the way they see you, so that they do see you and appreciate what you do every day. Maybe it's as simple as a \"thank you,\" but it's not taking for granted what you do every day so that we can live free.\nSo having you guys here for this movie -- which is cool because it's not out yet, right? (Laughter.) Nobody else is seeing this -- this is really a special thing. So you have to commit to not sharing the plotline. (Laughter.) You cannot give anything away, okay? (Laughter.) But you should lord it over your friends and family. (Laughter and applause.) Without a doubt. It's like, guess what I did -- no, I can't. (Laughter.) I can't tell you anymore. (Laughter.) It's just amongst us, it's just between us.\nBut this is just a small but hopefully special way that we can show you how much we here at the White House and how many people, including all of the creators and the stars of \"Star Trek,\" how cool they think you all are. And this isn't just here -- this is everywhere around the country and, quite frankly, around the world. We can't say it enough, we can't say it loud enough, but hopefully a cool movie in the White House is a good beginning. (Laughter.)\nSo I am going to stop talking so that we can get on with the movie. Again, I want to thank you guys for everything you do for our country. Your First Lady loves you, and we hope you have a great time this afternoon.\n\"May the Force be with you.\" (Laughter and applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-07-19", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at a Joining Forces Drop-By Before a Screening of \"Star Trek Beyond\""}
{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121176", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, folks. How are you? Ladies and gentlemen, before I begin, I want to make a public statement about what you've recently read about again a tragedy in the United States relating to our law enforcement officers.\nI join President Obama in strongly condemning today's targeted attack on law enforcement in Baton Rouge, Louisiana that killed three police officers and wounded three others. And it's a despicable act, and it's an attack on our very way of life at home. We don't have the detail yet. We don't exactly know how this occurred, what the motive might have been behind it. But like thousands of other law enforcement officers -- and where I come from, the neighborhood I grew up in, my background, I have a very, very close relationship with law enforcement. And they've been the core of my support for years. And they're the guys that -- and women that I grew up with in my neighborhood. You knew that when you got in trouble, they'd have your back. They were the same kid who when you needed help was the one that jumped in. They're the people, like they are here in Australia, that they're always the ones who are there.\nAnd every day, every single day, tens of thousands of law enforcement peace officers wake up in Australia and the United States, and they put on their badge. And they go out and do the job knowing that anything could happen to them. And they respond, and they respond to help.\nThere was a 911 call involving this incident. We don't know who made the call -- whether the shooter with an assault weapon or whether or not it was someone else identifying this shooter. But every time they respond, they know they're putting themselves in danger. So they're an incredible group of men and women.\nAnd I say to the folks back home, we owe them a great deal of gratitude and thanks for what they do, for their commitment.\nAnd at home we cannot let others divide us now by making more or less of this than it really is. That's not why we're here. It's not who we are. And it's not who law enforcement is. My heart goes out -- I say to the folks back home, my heart goes out to those families. And my enduring thanks for every police officer who gets up in the morning, or goes out on that night shift and they look for one thing. They kiss their wife good-bye, or their husband, and they want to go home and tuck in their kids. They have a right to do that. They have a right to be able to be protected. And we owe them big. So I just say, God bless the fallen. And to their families, their brothers or sisters, we will get to the bottom of this. But our enduring thanks to every law enforcement officer back home.\nAnd I say to all of you I doubt whether it's much different right here in Australia, the kind of people who go into law enforcement. They do it because they want to help. They sure don't do it for the wages. They do it because they want to help.\nWell, let me begin for the reason I'm here, Madam President. I like -- I got to get used to saying that at home I hope. (Laughter.) Just saying, that's all. (Applause.) I don't know.\nBut thank you for the introduction and for leading Boeing Australia.\nThis is an incredible facility, and it reflects the true economic partnership that exists between the United States of America and Australia.\nI was going around with the boss who had a timesheet worrying about whether or not I was slowing up productivity in this -- (laughter). But what we're talking about is every manufacturing operation, every sophisticated, high-tech manufacturing operation that goes on around the world -- in the States or here -- those that work the best are the ones that empower their employees the most; have the faith in the employees most. And that's why you guys and women are so damn good here.\nAnd last year our nations, we traded in goods and services over $50 billion. America's three biggest imports from Australian were beef and raw materials and medical devices among many other things. And in terms of what the United States exports, our three biggest exports were everything from pork to machinery to automobiles.\nThe United States is Australia's top trading partner when it comes to services --in business consulting, in financial services, and business expertise. We have nearly $200 billion in direct foreign investment in each of our countries -- over $200 billion businesses in Australia and the United States have invested in the other country, that amount of money. America's businesses invested more in Australia than anyone else around the world has invested in Australia. And Australian businesses invest more in America than anywhere else in the world.\nAnd these investments range from mining, to technology, to pharmaceuticals, to tourism, to aerospace manufacturing like we have right here.\nBoeing, in my view, is an example of where investments in Australia are mutually beneficial to both our countries. I know where I come from in my old neighborhood back home there's a lot of talk about trade. Is it mutually beneficial? A lot of folks who -- as I said, the neighborhood I grew up in, you either got a trade, or you ended up being a law enforcement officer, a fireman, or you became a priest. I wasn't qualified for any one of them so I had to do something else.\nBut all kidding aside, there's a lot of talk that international trade and commerce in a global economy is not beneficial. Well, so many jobs in both our countries depend on this.\nBoeing has invested nearly $1 billion here in Australia,\nemploying ,over 3,500 high-skilled, high-paid workers. And you deserve every penny you make. This facility alone invested over $300 million to date and invested an additional $70 million over the past two years. And you're on a cutting edge -- no pun intended -- of technology and aerospace. And all these investments put high-skilled production workers alongside cutting-edge researchers, and you're under one roof.\nOne of the things I've learned, Madam President, I've traveled around the world, is that one of the reasons why an awful lot of corporations are coming home either to Australia or to the United States is because we view things a little bit differently. And by that I mean we're in a situation where there's an outfit called AT Kearney. And they ask the 300 biggest industrialists in the world, meaning -- speaking of the largest economies in the world, where do you want to invest? And by a margin larger than any time they kept this survey over the last 19 years, they say the United States of America -- of large countries.\nAnd the reason they do is the same reason why people want to be here in Australia. You have a system that protects intellectual property. You have a court system where if you have a dispute, you can settle it fairly. No one is going to steal your product. You have energy available to you. You are in a situation where you have serious, serious workers -- the most productive workers in the world, right here in this room. You're among the most productive workers in the world.\nThat's why the future belongs to those countries that engage in fair trade, those countries that engage in empowering their workforce, those countries that engage in practices that are totally consistent with the conduct of international commerce and international intercourse.\nSo right here, the result is 1,200 high-skilled, good-paying jobs for production workers and engineers making wing flaps for the Dreamliner flying around the world. And these are -- speaking to your elected officials who have the same goal as we do at home. How do we maintain? You are to the great pride of your country and the envy of the world, one of the great middle-class countries in the world. The notion is anybody can make it. Anybody can make it if they go out there and bust their neck, there's an even shot you get a shot. And you're entitled to participate in the profits of any of the outfits you work with. You increase their productivity, you get to participate in that outcome.\nAnd that's why in recent surveys 98 percent of the folks in Australia say they are middle class or they are working class, and they believe they can, in fact, make it.\nAnd it all depends on being able to have a job. My dad who had to move to find work when we were -- when I was growing up as a kid, moved from one part of America to another part to get a job because coal mines were shutting down. He was not a coal miner, but he worked in an area where steel and coal were king. And after World War II they weren't anymore.\nAnd he moved to a place where it was growing in a state called Delaware and southeast Pennsylvania, if you know anything about my country. And he had a good job. Then he came back after a year and picked us up at my grandpop's home and took us down and we had a good living -- lived a good middle-class life.\nBut every time my father would -- someone would talk about a job, my dad would say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. A job is about your dignity. A job is about your place in the community. A job is about who you are. A job is about being able to hold your head up, take care of your kids, make sure you're able to meet your family's needs.\nAnd for middle-class jobs here is not any different than the United States. It's being able to own your own home and not have to rent it; being able to send your kid to a park where you know they're going to come home safely; being able to send him to a high school that if they do well, they can get to college. If they get to college, you figure out how the hell to get them there. You'll be able to do it. You'll figure out how you can do it. And if one of your elderly parents dies, you have enough to take care of them -- the one who survives -- and hope your children never have to take care of you. That's what middle class means where I come from. I think that's what it means here. But it depends on good, solid, expanding jobs like you have right here.\nAnd these investments start virtuous cycles. We see it right here with Boeing investments benefiting Australian companies in the aerospace supply chain. Last year you invested $500 million alone in over 700 small businesses benefitting from the spinoff of what occurs here at this factory.\nAnd so we see the benefits, as well, for American workers. Those who say trade is only a one-way street. It's not. Boeing has over 150,000 employees back home in the United States. Boeing has invested $50 billion with U.S. suppliers, beyond what they invested here. And it supports more than 1.5 million jobs back home at thousands and thousands of American businesses.\nBecause you're building the Dreamliner wing flaps here, Qantas Air finalized a deal with Boeing to purchase eight Boeing Dreamliners. That's worth nearly $2 billion. So those who say why am I visiting a factory that is an American corporation in a foreign country paying good wages to over a thousand people, I say that's the reason why. That's the reason why. We both benefit. And Dreamliners, the stuff you're building here, and the Dreamliners that are assembled back in the United States.\nMore than 8,000 Americans work directly on the Dreamliner, and that means good jobs in Seattle and for 8,000 Americans who worked directly for Dreamliner and hundred thousands of others up and down the aerospace chain that benefit from this. That's what I mean by a virtuous cycle. You have a good product. You invest in it. You do it well. You produce it well. It becomes the best product in the world. It generates a virtuous cycle.\nAnd awful lot of people around this facility who run diners and movie theaters and barber shops, there's more waitresses employed. There's more tickets bought. There's more automobiles bought because you all have good, decent jobs. And the jobs you have employ other people because of what you have here.\nAnd so, folks, it means that access to Australian markets for American companies -- and there's more of this in the offing. That's why I'm extremely pleased to be here.\nThis is an example how trade should work. This is how it should work. And I'll say it again. I was recently with a lot of your elected officials. Tomorrow I'll be with more. And you know what, I've been doing this job a long time, but I've never been more optimistic than I am today -- never more optimistic in my whole life for democracies that understand the rule of law; that invest in research and development; that actually invest in their workers.\nThe truth of the matter is that we're going to own the 21st century. We want everybody to do -- I want to see China do well. I want to see Europe do well. I want to see them all do well because I want to buy them -- have them buy more Dreamliners. I want them to be able to sell products that say Made in Australia, Made in America. Because we can compete with anybody. You can. We can. Anybody in the world if it's a level playing field. Just give us an even shot. That's stamped into the DNA of most Aussies and the same it is for the United States.\nAnd so the economic relationship between us is -- you're going to see more high tech and more high productivity and more commerce between us.\nThe investments in research and production facilities are going to increase. And highly skilled workers earning a fair wage are going to be able to share in the productivity of those gains. We're investing in the middle class, and that's good for Australia. And that's good for the United States of America. Because, folks, back home I'm facetiously referred to as Middle Class Joe. In Washington that means I'm not sophisticated. (Laughter.) But I know how to fight. I know what it means.\nWhen the middle class does well, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well when we do well. The poor have a way up when we do well. And one of the reasons for the social and economic stability and political stability in Australia and the United States is because we have a solid, solid, solid middle class.\nI'll conclude by saying I've spent an awful lot of time traveling around the world doing foreign policy. Just since I've been Vice President, I've traveled over 1.2 million miles. And I usually get sent to meet with world leaders. I know them all -- not because I'm so good, just it's been my job. Before this I headed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so I've known these leaders from around the world for a long time.\nAnd, folks, all politics is personal, including foreign policy. You got to know the other guy's motive. You got to know what his limitations are. You got to know what his interests are in order to determine your own. And I've spent a lot of time with President Xi of China. I've spent over 24, 25 hours of private dinners with him. He's an interesting guy. We were in Chengdu two years ago, just a month or so before he became President. He was Vice President. And he looked at me and he said, can you define for me America? And I could have said the same thing if he asked me about Australia. I said, yes, I can. I can define it in one word: Possibilities. Possibilities.\nIt's stamped into our mutual DNA that anything is possible. Any damn thing is possible. Give ordinary people an opportunity, and they do extraordinary things. That's the history of the journey of both our countries. And I think that's why the future is going ally with people like us -- America and Australia -- who just really truly believe everyone is entitled to be treated with a little bit of dignity. Everyone is entitled to be given an even shot. And when you do that, we do extraordinary things.\nYou're an extraordinary country. I'm proud to be here. I'm proud of what you're doing.\nAnd may God bless you all and may God protect our troops -- yours and ours, keep them out of harm's way. Thank you so much, everyone.

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121180", "text": "VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you very much. It's not hard when you believe it.\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. It's a delight to be here, and it's a real pleasure to be in Australia. And I mean that seriously.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you for the incredible welcome and the undeserved words of praise that you have shown me, the welcome, and what you've said.\nThe warmth and the hospitality of the Australian people these past few days have been overwhelming. My whole staff -- some have been here before -- feel it. You can smell it. You can taste it. It really is -- it is welcoming.\nAnd let me start, Mr. Prime Minister, by congratulating you on your recent victory. And I'm proud to have this opportunity to celebrate and strengthen the relationship which is incredibly important not just to me and the President, but to all the American people.\nThose of you in the press who have been to the United States, I doubt whether any of you will say anything contrary to what I'm about to acknowledge, and that is if you find an American who isn't welcoming of an Australian, I'd like to know where it is. There is an overwhelming sense of -- it's almost unreal of camaraderie and connectedness to Australia, even though it's a world away, as they say.\nAnd so it's not just that we have fought side by side for the past hundred years in every major encounter, and for the last 65 years we've had a formal military alliance, but it's the daily touches of family, of relationships, of friendships, of partnerships, of shared values. And I really mean it when I say shared values. We're both nations of immigrants. We are both nations who are fiercely independent. And we defend fiercely -- to use the word twice -- the right of everyone to be treated with dignity and with respect.\nI don't know any place where there's a greater comfort zone that we feel than being here among all of you, and I hope you feel the same way when you're in the States.\nAnd ultimately, I think there's a simple reason our country works so well together, across the board, our values are the same. We have a line in our Constitution say: \"In order for form a more perfect union.\" We are constantly trying to improve. We don't always succeed. We're constantly trying to improve on our country's success, but on how we deal with one another and deal with the world, to make a more perfect union.\nAnd I believe to our core that we share the view that freedom and equality are about what we're about.\nNow that sounds almost corny. It's phrases you'd expect public officials, elected officials to say, but you guys feel it in your bones: We hold these truths self-evident that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, the right to life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. It's in your DNA. You feel it. It's real. And that's why you're so respected by Americans.\nOver the past few days, Mr. Prime Minister, I met with many business leaders and entrepreneurs discussing how our two nations can continue to grow and drive innovation and economic growth in the 21st century. And I toured the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, in Melbourne, where you've must made a billion dollar investment, providing the best possible care and treatment and analysis that is a quality that's equal to any in the world. And I met with Australian researchers, doctors, scientists, oncologists who are on the leading edge of cancer research, particularly in proteogenomics, which is -- as I used a metaphor -- it's like the genes are the full roster of a basketball team. The proteins are the team you're going to play against and the five that you put on the court. And you're on the leading edge in what is going to be part of a breakthrough to change and alter cancer, as we know it.\nAnd I'm pleased to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that we've signed three memorandums of understanding between our two nations to do more together, to share data, to accelerate our progress to end cancer.\nAnd look, and I'll make you a prediction, Mr. Prime Minister, that the MOU that we signed is going to become the model -- literally the model -- for sharing data and information around the world, which is not happening now. The more rapidly it happens, the more quickly we'll be able to get to the causes of and the cures for.\nAnd I predict that you're going to see this repeated around the world. It's a great honor, as well, that I had to meet with Australian veterans. Your Foreign Minister was with me, or I was with her more accurately at the stadium. And it included a World War II vet that was head of the organization. And we were part of the Return and Service League of Australia. And he was a gentleman who acted like he was in his 50s, but he was a World War II vet.\nAnd the fact is that I got an opportunity to return a refurbished 48 Stars and Stripes, an American flag which had been taken ashore on Guadalcanal, a very costly battle which we prevailed in -- all of us -- and which for 60 years has found a home in Melbourne with the RSL.\nAnd today I was aboard the HMAS Adelaide in Sydney Harbor. And I got a real sense of how our alliance, and quite frankly, the genuine brotherhood that exists between our people. Not only did I speak to the crew, but to my left were assembled roughly 30 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan fighting side by side with my son and others like my son who spent time in both of those theaters.\nAnd it's a genuine camaraderie. It's a genuine sense of knowing, as my son said in Iraq, that you know there's an Aussie with you, they always have your back. I mean that sincerely.\nAnd I want to speak very briefly to your additional commitment in Iraq to train -- not only continue to train their counterterrorism force, but also to train their police. Your folks are the best trainers in the world. Your special operations forces have come in, taken on the responsibility of training the guts and the core of the Iraqi National Security Force, their counterterrorism force. You are part of the reason why they succeeded in Ramadi. And you will be part of the reason why the training you're providing to the police -- and they're talking about a significant number of police needed to stay behind to reconstruct and keep safety and security in areas that have been reclaimed from ISIS, from Daesh, as they say.\nAnd I can't tell you how much your commitment is appreciated. I spent a lot of time on the phone and in person with Prime Minister Abadi. He invited you. He invited you to do this because he knows, he understands your guys and women are the best. They're the best in the world at doing this.\nSo the fact is that today the Prime Minister and I spoke about a full range of issues affecting the U.S.-Australian bilateral relationship. And we discussed the regional and global issues that we both confront and confront together.\nTo start with, we talked about how we can continue to strengthen our robust economic ties that exist between our two countries. The trade between our two countries -- the trade agreement signed more than a decade ago has served as a foundational basis upon which to grow trade and fortify business investment between our countries.\nLast year the two-way trade between our nations in goods and services topped $60 billion. And our economic partnership has never been more important. We talked about the need for our two nations to continue to set the economic rules of the road with high-standard trade agreements to protect the rights of workers, preserve the environment, and uphold intellectual property rights. That's the basis upon which the 21st century rules of the road must be based.\nAnd Australia and the United States, as well, are both Pacific nations. I'm often asked whether I'm with President Xi in Beijing or whether I'm in Tokyo or whether I'm anywhere in this region -- we are a Pacific power. The United States is a Pacific power. We are going nowhere. We are going nowhere.\nAnd we believe we have been part of, along with Australia, the basis for stability, regional stability that's allowed everyone to grow -- from China, to Japan, to Korea, to Australia -- across the board, allowing everyone to grow. Stability is the basis upon which economic prosperity is founded.\nAnd we share a clear understanding of the importance of maintaining that stability throughout the Asia Pacific region.\nMr. Prime Minister and I, we reaffirmed our commitment to continue to work together to uphold the liberal international order that has served the world so well for the past 75 years, and to maintain the free flow of commerce and trade in the air and on sea, making sure the sea lanes are open and the skies are free for navigation. They are the lifeblood lines of commerce and the economic growth worldwide.\nThat's why last week both our nations issued strong statements urging China and the Philippines to abide by the Arbitral Tribunal's decision with regard to the South China Sea.\nWe also discussed the steps that Australia and the United States are taking so our troops can train more together and increase our interoperability so that we are fully prepared to respond to any challenges in the Pacific with a united front. It's important we stand together.\nThe Prime Minister and I also reinforced our shared commitment to wiping out ISIL's evil and countering terrorism around the world. Australian and American troops are working side by side in Iraq, as I said, training local partners to lead the fight on the ground. And we are flying missions over Syria, leading the global humanitarian effort to provide aid to those stranded folks who find themselves caught in a nether land, and to provide the necessary relief for millions of refugees and innocents who are caught in the crossfire, suffering very badly in Syria.\nOur alliance has been the source of incredible strength for both our countries for decades now, and I believe it will continue to be as we work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century and also, by the way, take advantages of the opportunities of the 21st century.\nI've been doing this a long time, Mr. Prime Minister. I've never been more optimistic about our prospects. I really mean this, never been more optimistic about our prospects than I am today. There is no reason why we cannot in the 21st century even be more prosperous, more capable, and more forward leaning than we have been in the 20th century.\nI'm speaking about more than just the sum total of our cooperation together. I'm going to speak to these issues and to our shared values tomorrow when I make a speech here in Sydney. So I won't bore you with any more today.\nBut let me say in closing that, again, quoting my son, Australia and the United States, we've had each other's back for a long time. We continue to have one another's back. And I assure you, the United States is going nowhere. The United States is here in the Pacific to stay. We are a Pacific nation. We are a Pacific power. And we will do our part to maintain peace and stability in the region.\nEverything I've seen over the last few days only makes me more confident, Mr. Prime Minister, that we'll continue to write new chapters together that will not only benefit both our nations but -- it may sound presumptuous to say, but I think benefit the region and benefit the world.\nSo again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your hospitality and may God protect our troops. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-07-19", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President Following a Meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney, Australia"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 4:35 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Officer Matthew Gerald and Corporal Montrell Jackson, Baton Rouge Police Department, and Deputy Brad Garafola, East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, who were killed in the police shootings in Baton Rouge, LA, on July 17; and Deputies Bruce Simmons and Nicholas Tullier, East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, and Officer Brad Montgomery, Baton Rouge Police Department, who were injured in the Baton Rouge shootings.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117931", "text": "We just had a useful discussion, following up on the Task Force meeting that I had last week, as well as a number of conversations that we've had with various stakeholders in the wake of the tragic events that we've seen over the last couple of weeks.\nObviously, the loss of three more police officers in Baton Rouge over the weekend, three of them still wounded, one critically wounded—and we're praying for him as we speak—right on the heels of Dallas indicates the degree to which it is very important for us to do everything we can to help police officers go home at night and to be safe. And as I said the other night, it's a reminder of the extraordinary risks and dangers that they are taking every single day to protect us and our way of life.\nAnd as has been consistent throughout all the conversations I've had over the last several weeks, I strongly believe that there is no contradiction between us protecting our officers, honoring our officers, making sure that they have all the tools they need to do their job safely, and building trust between police officers and departments in the communities that they serve. In fact, those things are complementary and not contradictory.\nAnd the more we can do to make sure that communities feel that these are their police departments and that they have a interest in protecting them, the easier it's going to be for police officers to do their jobs.\nThe good news is that, thanks to the leadership of Attorney General Lynch, FBI Director Comey, as well as Secretary Jeh Johnson at DHS, we do have a toolkit of best practices, of training, of resources and equipment that can help police departments protect their officers, make sure that they can do their jobs. But we're going to have to do more than we already are doing.\nAnd some of that is engaging at the local level, because this cannot just be a Federal, top-down initiative, this has to be a local initiative in the 18,000 law enforcement jurisdictions that are out there all across the country. And it also has to be resourced. We were talking—just to give you a few examples—about the great interest on the part of police departments around the country in training for safety, deescalation, dealing with active-shooter cases. Unfortunately, not all those departments that want to train their officers have the resources to do it. And the Justice Department has programs that can be made available, but we don't have enough coverage, not as much as we'd like.\nSomething as basic as bulletproof vests, large numbers of departments do have bulletproof vests for all their officers on patrol and in situations where there's significant risk, but there are a number of places where they're still short of bulletproof vests. That can make a difference.\nAnd so my intention over the next several months, as long as I'm in this office, is to continue to look at best practices, figure out what's working well; listen to our police departments in how we can help them engage the community, build up trust. What kind of equipment do they need? What kind of training do they need? What kind of recruitment strategies that—do they need? And then to do everything we can to convene all parties concerned, including Congress, to make sure that they can get those resources.\nAnd we are going to continue, building off the Task Force report and the meeting that we had last week, to encourage the kinds of conversations between police departments and communities so that we can incorporate—as part of a strategy to make the lives of police officers safer—encourage the kind of best practices that assure communities are embracing their police departments the way they should and the way they need to.\nSo I appreciate the efforts that have already taken place. We've got a lot more work to do. I want to repeat, this is not something that we're going to be able to do solely from this office or from the Justice Department or the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security. This is something that's going to have to be bottom up and not just top down.\nBut the fact that in the wake of this tragedy, we've seen over the course of several weeks much more constructive conversations and the offering up of very concrete recommendations and suggestions for how we can do better is encouraging to me.\nAll right? Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-07-19", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117925", "text": "Mr. Chairman, delegates, friends and my fellow Americans:\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence.\nAnd on behalf of my family, here and gone, I accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the United States of America. [cheers and applause]\nAnd let me thank Speaker Paul Ryan for that gracious welcome.\nPaul, you're a true friend and a great American leader.\nBut Paul knows me well, and he knows the introduction I prefer is just a little bit shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order. [applause]\nYou know, I'm new to this campaign and honestly I never thought I'd be standing here. I thought I'd be spending this evening with all my friends from the great state of Indiana. [applause]\nYet, there I was, a few days ago in New York City with the man who won 37 states, who faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them and along the way brought millions of new voters into the Republican Party. [applause]\nYou know, he's a man known for a larger personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma. And so, I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket. [laughter]\nWell, for those of you who don't know me, which is most of you...[laughter]...I grew up on the front row of the American dream. My grandfather immigrated to this country. I was raised in a small town in southern Indiana, in a big family with a cornfield in the backyard.\nAlthough we weren't really a political family, the heroes of my youth were President John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [applause]\nWhen I was young, I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters: a family, a business and a good name. I was raised to believe in hard work, in faith and family. My dad, Ed Pence, was a combat veteran in Korea. [applause] Dad ran gas stations in our small town and he was a great father. If Dad were with us today, I have a feeling he'd enjoy this moment and probably be pretty surprised. [laughter]\nBut it's such a joy for me to tell you that my mother is here. Would you join me in welcoming the light of my life, my mom, Nancy. [applause]\nYou know, growing up I actually started in politics in the other party until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 40th president and I said on for the Reagan revolution. [applause]\nBut the best thing that ever happened to me, even counting tonight, was that 31 years ago I married the girl of my dreams, a school teacher and artist. She is everything to me. Would you welcome my wonderful wife, Karen Pence. [applause]\nAnd regardless of any title I'll ever hold, the most important job I'll ever have is spelled D-A-D. [applause]\nKaren and I are blessed. Karen and I are blessed to be the parents of the three greatest kids in the world: a writer named Charlotte, a college student named Audrey and a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps Michael J. Pence.\nI'm so proud of you guys. [applause]\nNow, if you know anything about Hoosiers, you know we love to suit up and compete. We play to win. That's why I joined this campaign in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down, a fighter, a winner. Until now, he's had to do it all by himself against all odds, but this week, with this united party, he's got backup. And on November 8th, I know we will elect Donald Trump to be the 45th president of the United States of America! [applause]\nNow, we'll win because we're running on the issues facing this country and because we're leveling with the American people about the stakes and the choice.\nYou know, the American people are tired of being told. They're tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. They're tired of hearing politicians in both parties tell us that we'll get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of debt on our children and our grandchildren.\nAnd as Ronald Reagan used to say, they're tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves. [applause]\nIn the end, this election comes down to just two names on the ballot, so let's resolve here and now that Hillary Clinton will never become president of the United States of America. [applause]\nNow, Hillary Clinton essentially offers a third Obama term. And the role is perfect for her. She championed \"Obamacare\" because years earlier she had all but invented it. The national debt has nearly doubled in these eight years and her only answer is to keep borrowing and spending. And like the president, she thinks the path to a growing economy is more taxes, more regulation and more government. [audience jeers]\nNow, they tell us this economy is the best that we can do. It's nowhere near the best that we could do, it's just the best that they can do. [applause]\nNow, let me tell you, I know firsthand it doesn't have to be like this. In my home state of Indiana we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and health care. [applause]\nYou know, Indiana is a state that works because conservative principles work every time you put them into practice. [applause]\nAUDIENCE: We want Mike! We want Mike!\nNow, today, while the nation suffers under the weight of $19 trillion in a national debt, we in Indiana have a $2 billion surplus, the highest credit rating in the nation, even though we've cut taxes every year since I became governor four years ago. [applause]\nWe have fewer state employees than when I took office, and businesses large and small have created nearly 150,000 new jobs, and there's more Hoosiers going to work than ever before. That's what you can do with common sense Republican leadership and that's exactly what the no-nonsense leadership of Donald Trump will bring to the White House. [applause]\nYou know, Donald Trump gets it, he's the genuine article. He's a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. And when Donald Trump does his talking, he doesn't tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness. [applause]\nHe's his own man, distinctly American. And where else would an independent spirit like his find a following than in the land of the free and the home of the brave. [applause]\nThe funny thing is...\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\nYou know, the funny thing is the party in power seems helpless to figure out our nominee. The media has the same problem. [laughter]\nThey all keep telling each other that the usual methods will work against him. They keep thinking they've done him in, only to wake up the next morning and find that Donald Trump is still standing and running stronger than ever before. The man just doesn't quit. [applause]\nHe's tough. He perseveres. He's gone about as far as you can go in business, but he's never turned his back on the working men and women who make this country grow. [applause]\nAnd Donald Trump will never turn his back on those who serve and protect us at home and abroad. [applause]\nYou know, it's been a heartbreaking time for the women and men in our law enforcement community. And in this time of great testing for them, let's let them know here and now, all across this country, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line of law enforcement in America. [applause]\nNow, you know, while Donald Trump was taking my measure as a possible running mate, I did some observing myself. I've seen the way he deals with people who work for him at every level. And I've seen the way they feel about working for him.\nNow, I'll grant you he can be a little rough with politicians on the stage, and I'll be we see that again. [applause]\nBut I've seen this good man up close, his utter lack of pretense, his respect for the people who work for him and his devotion to his family. [applause]\nAnd if you still doubt what I'm saying, remember, as we say back home, you can't fake good kids. How about his amazing children, aren't they something? [applause]\nThese are the true measures of our nominee, chosen by the voters as the right man for these times. This is the outsider, my running mate, who turned a long-shot campaign into a movement.\nNow, over in the other party, you know, if the idea was to present the exact opposite of a political outsider, the exact opposite of an uncalculating truth-teller, then on that score you've got to hand it to the Democratic establishment, they outdid themselves this time! [applause]\nI mean, at the very moment when America is crying out for something new and different, the other party has answered with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names. People in both parties are restless for change, ready to break free of old patterns in Washington. And Democrats are about to anoint someone who represents everything this country is tired of.\nYou know, Hillary Clinton wants a better title and I would, too, if I was already America's secretary of the status quo. [applause]\nYou know, the choice couldn't be more clear. Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the failed establishment in Washington, D.C. or we can choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again. It's change versus status quo. And my fellow Republicans, when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America, the change will be huge. [applause]\nYou know, for years we've had fundamental problems in America that get talked to death in Washington, D.C., but they never get solved and they even get worse. We've seen entire stretches of our country written off by bad economic policies in ways that are deeply unfair to American workers. We've seen relentless mandates from the executive branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise and no provision of the Constitution is too large for them to ignore. [applause]\nMeanwhile, we've seen borders that go unrespected, a military that's been diminished, and promise after ringing promise to our veterans, promptly forgotten.\nThen Donald Trump came along and started saying what practically everybody was thinking anyway, that our leaders need to be stronger. Under Donald Trump, our deals will be smarter, our soldiers will have what they need and our veterans will have what they earned. We will secure our borders, protect our nation. In all this, we will be more serious. And when we do, this nation will start winning again. [applause]\nYou know, that's the message that men and women in both parties have been longing to hear. But none of us should think for one second that this will be easy. The outcome of this election depends on us and how we contend with an incredible onslaught that's coming our way.\nYou know, this won't be America's first glimpse of the Clinton machine in action, as Bernie Sanders can tell you. [laughter]\nAnd this time around, she'll have the press doing half her work for her. [audience jeers]\nThe good news is it won't be nearly enough, not against a candidate who's captured the attention of the country the way Donald Trump has. [applause]\nOn issue by issue, he and I will take our case to the voters, pointing out the failures of the Obama/Clinton agenda and showing a better way. We will win the hearts and minds of the American people with an agenda for a stronger and more prosperous America. [applause]\nNow, the establishment in Washington, D.C. thinks it's only a narrow range of voters who are giving Donald Trump a serious look. But I can tell you firsthand there's a lot of Americans out there who feel like Democrat politicians have taken them for granted. [applause]\nIt's union members who don't want a president who promises to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. [applause]\nThose miners want an American energy policy and they know that Donald Trump digs coal. [applause]\nIt's African Americans, who remember generations of hollow promises about safe streets and better schools, and they know Donald Trump will fight for equal opportunity. And he loves educational choice. [applause]\nAnd it's Hispanic Americans, who respect the law, want jobs and opportunities for their families, who know that Donald Trump will uphold the law and get this economy moving for every American. [applause]\nYou know, the party of Lincoln was founded on equality of opportunity. And during these difficult days, it will be our party and our agenda that opens the doors for every American to succeed and prosper in this land. [applause]\nYou know, in so many ways the Democratic Party has abandoned those it used to protect. Maybe they've become too entrenched in power, so comfortable at times that they lose patience with the normal legislative process. It's so much simpler to impose their values by executive order or court action. And make no mistake about it, Hillary Clinton has some big ideas along those lines, too. [audience jeers]\nAs this election approaches, every American should know that while we're filling the presidency for the next four years, this election will define the Supreme Court for the next 40. [applause]\nWe all better think very carefully — very carefully — about what this means for our Constitution and limited government. Elect Hillary Clinton and you better get used to being subject to unelected judges using unaccountable power to take unconstitutional actions.\nSo let me say, for the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of the sanctity of life, for the sake of our Second Amendment and for the sake of all our other God-given liberties, we must ensure that the next president appointing justices to the Supreme Court is Donald Trump. [applause]\nAnd Hillary Clinton's record on foreign affairs gets even worse. You know, it was Hillary Clinton who helped undo all the gains of the troop surge, a staggering failure of judgment that set ISIS on the loose.\nIt was Hillary Clinton who instigated the president's disastrous agreement with the radical mullahs in Iran. And it was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, what difference at this point does it make? [audience jeers]\nAs the proud father of a United States Marine, let me say from my heart, anyone who said that, anyone who did that should be disqualified from ever serving as commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States of America! [applause]\nSeven-and-a-half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies have weakened America's place in the world. Terrorist attacks at home and abroad, grim and heartbreaking scenes from France just a few short days ago, and the attempted coup in Turkey all attest to a world spinning apart.\nHistory teaches us that weakness arouses evil. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy of leading from behind, moving red lines, feigning resets with Russia, and the rise, rule and reign of ISIS are a testament to this truth of history. We cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends. [applause]\nAmerica needs to be strong for the world to be safe, and on the world stage Donald Trump will lead from strength. [applause]\nDonald Trump will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Donald Trump will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemies of our freedom. [applause]\nAnd if the world knows nothing else, it will know this: America stands with Israel! [applause]\nYou know, if you looked at the calendar this morning you might have noticed the presidency of Barack Obama ends exactly six months from today. [applause]\nAUDIENCE: We like Mike! We like Mike!\nAnd this much is certain, this much is certain of the Obama years. They're not ending well. There seems to be so many things that divide us and so few great purposes that unite us as they once did. And it's at moments like this, moments when politics fail, that I believe we'd do well to remember that what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in America. [applause]\nThat we are, as we have always been, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [applause]\nShould I have the awesome privilege to serve as your vice president, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people of yours without it.\nMy fellow Americans, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny. And I have faith, faith in the boundless capacity of the American people and faith that God can still heal our land. [applause]\nBut we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want a president who will protect this nation, confront radical Islamic terrorism and rid the world of ISIS, if you want a president who will restore law and order to this country and give law enforcement the support and resources they deserve, if you want a president who will cut taxes, grow our economy and squeeze every nickel out of the federal bureaucracy...[applause]...if you want a president who will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want a president who will upend the status quo in Washington, D.C. and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution...[applause]...we have but one choice and that man is ready, this team is ready, our party is ready.\nAnd when we elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States, together we will make America great again! [applause]\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America!", "timestamp": "2016-07-20", "title": "Address Accepting the Vice Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117927", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:10 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any comments to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Thank you. Let's start with the breaking political news, or Republican convention news -- the statement from Melania Trump's speechwriter that she made a mistake and incorporated some phrasing from Michelle Obama in Melania Trump's speech. Do you have any comment on that today?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing beyond what I said yesterday. Look, obviously, Mrs. Obama spoke movingly, in her own words, about her life story, about her values. And she was warmly received by the crowd. She got strong reviews from pundits. And I'm confident that in the future, aspiring first ladies or potential first husbands would draw on the same kinds of sentiments to advocate for their spouse.\nAnd Mrs. Obama is quite proud of the speech that she gave in 2008, and I'm confident that she'll deliver another speech that's equal to the test next week.\nQ: Can you say whether the news has made its way through various parts of the White House and reached the President and/or the First Lady? Are they aware of the statement from the Trump campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not spoken to the President and the First Lady since that letter became public, so I'm not sure if they're aware of it right now.\nQ: To follow up on yesterday's meeting the President had with the Attorney General and others on police matters. He talked about police departments around the country needing resources for things like bullet-proof vests and training and other items. Can you say if he's preparing to ask Congress for money to provide police departments with those things?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is clear is that as is true of solving so many of these complex problems, there's an important role for Congress to play. And has been true for much of the last 18 months, it's not at all evident that the Republicans who lead the House and the Senate are up to the job. Included in the President's budget proposal were resources that could be -- could have been dedicated to those kinds of priorities, but as you recall, Republicans wouldn't even convene a hearing to discuss the President's budget.\nEvery year for the last 40 years, whether Democrats were in charge or Republicans were in charge of the Congress, there's been a hearing about the President's budget, where the President's budget director has been called to testify, to discuss the priorities that are included in the President's budget. And this year Republicans cancelled that hearing, and they wouldn't even discuss those proposals with the President's budget director. It's particularly ironic because Republicans have, themselves, utterly failed to pass their own budget, either in the House or the Senate. So it's an indication that the congressional budget process is broken. And it's the American people that have to deal with the consequences.\nBut the President obviously believes that our men and women in law enforcement would benefit from additional support from the federal government and the President is certainly eager to provide it. I don't have any news to make about an additional funding request, but when it comes to COP grants and funding for staffing and resources and equipment, the President believes that Congress needs to make that a priority.\nQ: Lastly, the new British Prime Minister is on her first overseas trip. She's in Germany today meeting with Angela Merkel. She's supposed to go to France. When President Obama spoke with her last week, did he invite her to come to the White House? Would he like to see her here before his time in office is up?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President extended a specific invitation to Washington, D.C. I think the President's expectation is that when she travels to China for the G20 that she will be in attendance and they will have an opportunity to see one another there.\nIf there's an additional meeting scheduled either before or after that conversation, we'll definitely let you know.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thanks. So Reuters reported yesterday that Donald Trump, if he wins the presidency, has a plan where he would purge any federal government officials appointed by this administration, and that he might seek legislation from the Congress to make it easier to fire public workers. And part of that is a concern because they fear that this administration might try to convert appointees to civil servants, which would make it harder for them to get rid of these appointees. I guess, first of all, is that a plan? Like is there any idea about converting appointees from this administration into civil servants as the term comes to an end? And then also, just a response to this idea that if Trump were elected that he would do this purge.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think just as a factual matter, my understanding is that there is a specific process that certain political appointees can enter into to make themselves eligible for a career civil service position in the federal government. And I know that political appointees in both parties over the years have availed themselves of that process. I will acknowledge I don't have a lot of detailed knowledge about what that process is, but I just know that that is a longstanding precedent.\nThe second thing that I know, based on the Reuters reporting that I've seen on this, is that this is a policy priority that was identified and promoted by Governor Christie. I think it's fair to say that if you want to stack up the ethical record of President Obama and his political appointees against the ethical record compiled by Governor Christie and his political appointees that we'd welcome that kind of comparison.\nQ: And on to Zika. So Florida health officials are investigating the case of Zika that may be actually locally transmitted and not connected to travel outside of this region. I was wondering, is the White House being kept abreast of this investigation? And also, like, is there a concern that now is this the start of maybe the disease spreading locally here in the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've seen these reports of what could potentially be the first example of local transmission of the Zika virus. And by local transmission I mean an individual in the United States who has not traveled overseas to a Zika-infected location, but rather somebody who contracted the Zika virus through a mosquito bite here in the United States. It would be the first time that has happened.\nI know the Florida authorities are still taking a look at this, and they obviously would be the ones to confirm any results that they have reached. The Centers for Disease Control and other public health experts in the federal government have been in close touch with public health officials in Florida on this matter and I would expect that they will continue to be, both as they conduct the investigation and also as they initiate any needed response.\nThat's going to be -- as we saw with Ebola, the effective coordination between federal public health authorities and state and local public health authorities will be critical to our success in combatting this virus, and it's certainly something that public health officials at the highest levels of the CDC are closely watching.\nI think what is unfortunate is those very public health professionals in the federal government that are responsible for fighting this disease, providing support to state and local health officials to prevent the spread of this disease, don't have all of the resources that they would like to have to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And the reason for that is simply Republicans have rebuffed that request. Yet, again, Republicans in Congress have a responsibility to step up and foot the bill for the response to a genuine public emergency, and Republicans in Congress dropped the ball in a way that makes the American people more vulnerable.\nAnd, again, I guess they'll have the seven weeks of a recess to think about the consequences of their failure to deal with this situation. That's unfortunate. But the federal government is certainly prepared to use the resources that we have to coordinate with officials in Florida, in this case, to investigate what happened and to respond accordingly in a way that's necessary to protect the people of Florida and the people of the United States.\nMichelle.\nQ: Yesterday, when we were talking about this speech incident at the convention, you mentioned that, well, you know, it shows that there's bipartisan support of these kinds of values. But in this particular speech, the wording and phrasing was taken from the First Lady's speech. Even if the sentiments or the idea was the same, the words themselves were taken. Does that bother you, or does that bother the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let people draw their own conclusions based on what they have seen of the speech delivered by both women, eight years apart.\nQ: But now that we know that the words were taken, so that's changed. But I'm asking, does it bother you that those words were taken from the First Lady's speech, as though -- credit was then given, though it was maybe better placed somewhere else -- does it bother the President or you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the focus that we've had has been on the substance of the speech. And the fact that Mrs. Trump received such warm applause and such a strong review of her speech based on a reflection of the same kinds of values that were included in Mrs. Obama's speech, I think that's an indication that the country has got a lot of common ground, even in spite of the political divisions that are on display at the convention. And I think that certainly buttresses an argument the President has been making quite frequently of late about the country not being as divided as it might seem.\nQ: Well, how do you say that when some of the other speeches within the same basic time frame were blasting Secretary Clinton and President Obama? I mean, isn't that completely the opposite of what you just said?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think those are the kinds of speeches that might make it seem that our country is quite divided, but, again, a speech that closely tracks with what Mrs. Obama said eight years ago and highlighting the same kinds of values, highlight the importance of those values in terms of the next generation of Americans and in our system of government receives applause in the room and strong reviews from pundits -- again, I think that's an indication that there's a lot of common ground and that Americans are drawing on the same kinds of values.\nAgain, their political leaders may have their differences, but the values of the country are still broadly shared. I think the real question -- and this is a question that ultimately the American people will determine in the fall -- is who is best suited to put forward an agenda and advance an agenda that embodies those values. And that's an assessment that the American people will make.\nQ: Do the speeches matter at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure. The conventions matter and the speeches matter. And that's the reason the First Lady is working so hard on hers, and the President is working so hard on his, is that it does give people an opportunity to be heard and to make a case about what they stand for and what our parties stand for. And, again, the American people I think will have an opportunity to evaluate those speeches, and those who tune into both will have an opportunity to compare the values and the message that's included in both.\nQ: So when Governor Christie last night called on this huge crowd to judge Hillary Clinton guilty or not on a number of accounts, what's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have much of a reaction to that, again, beyond the observation I made earlier about the ethical record compiled by Governor Christie and his political appointees in New Jersey.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. To go back to the Reuters story about federal employees. If you remember, in early 2009, did this administration have a concern about agency staff that had been carried over from the Bush administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the irony of all this is that it's Republicans in Congress, chiefly, who have, in many cases, been waging an all-out assault on federal employees. It's Republicans who have advocated for cutting pay and cutting retirement benefits from civil servants.\nSo the President has been in a position of both making smart decisions when it comes to our budget, and there's some evidence that we can provide about growth and size of the U.S. government under President Obama is much smaller than the rate of growth of the federal government under self-described conservative Republican Presidents. So those are just the facts.\nSo I think the President's approach to this has been much more responsible. Again, when it comes to Governor Christie, I think he's got a tougher case to make.\nQ: Do you think there's any value in replacing agency heads and agency staff with people from the President has been able to select?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, we're balancing two priorities here, right? The President has talked about himself in terms of the value of fresh legs and new blood in important leadership positions in the federal government; that many of these jobs that are filled by civil servants are quite demanding, and having a schedule for turnover and giving different people with different perspectives and new insights, potentially, into the job is healthy for any organization and certainly is healthy for an organization as large as the federal government.\nAt the same time, there's institutional knowledge that's accrued over time, and people develop an expertise in a role or in a field that could be valuable. And in some cases, there are negative consequences for losing that institutional knowledge and that expertise.\nSo balancing those two things is certainly a challenge for any large organization that wants to preserve continuity. And that challenge is no less significant for the federal government, either. But the alternative to managing those kinds of changes is not changing at all, and I don't think anybody thinks that's an option and it certainly would not be an indication of a healthy democracy.\nSo the American people are counting on this kind of transition to be effectively managed to enjoy the benefits of protecting institutional knowledge and expertise, and maximizing the benefits of fresh thinking and fresh legs and new perspective. And that's certainly what the President has made a priority as we prepare for a transition that's set to take place in six months or so. I guess six months from today, actually, now that I think about it.\nQ: Only a half-year left. A couple questions on President Peсa Nieto's visit from Mexico. As you know, that will be the day after Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention.\nMR. EARNEST: I am aware of that. (Laughter.)\nQ: How much of this discussion do you expect will center on Trump's proposals, including a wall between the U.S. and Mexico?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not anticipate much time at all being spent on discussing that. There are any number of important, substantive issues between the United States and Mexico, and what President Obama has found over his seven and a half years in office is that effectively investing in the relationship with Mexico has strengthened the security and the economy of the United States. And coordinating on countering narcotics and drug-trafficking and other security issues has improved the security situation on both sides of the border. President Obama has obviously worked effectively with the Mexican government to reach a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that would raise labor and environmental standards, would raise standards when it comes to intellectual property protections in a way that would level the playing field for U.S. businesses and U.S. workers. That certainly has important economic benefits for the American people and the U.S. economy. So I'm confident that the President will be discussing that with his Mexican counterpart as well. So there's plenty on the agenda that doesn't involve the Republican nominee.\nQ: So is the visit or its timing, right between the two conventions, meant to highlight differences between Democrats and Republicans on treatment of Mexico or Latinos?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think the goal is to highlight the importance of the strong relationship between the United States and Mexico. And President Obama has certainly invested in that relationship in a way that has benefitted the American people.\nI know that President Peсa Nieto is committed to strengthening his country's relationship with the United States, regardless of who wins the presidential election. And he's looking to cement much of the progress that's been made under President Obama's leadership and create a strong platform for the next President to build on, in terms of our country's relationship with Mexico.\nSo, look, I think the other thing is they'll have a series of meetings here at the White House over the course of Friday morning, and then the two Presidents will come out and speak to all of you and take some questions about what they discussed. So you'll have an opportunity to hear from them about what priorities they've identified and what progress they've been able to make by continuing this dialogue that they had just as recently as a few weeks ago in Canada.\nQ: One more topic. In Turkey, after the coup and its aftermath, has that had an impact on anti-ISIS operations, either from Incirlik or elsewhere?\nMR. EARNEST: For a detailed explanation of that, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. My understanding, based on what my colleagues at the Department of Defense have communicated to me, is that there has not been a significant disruption of our efforts against ISIL, in part because there are operations -- flight operations that are still taking place at Incirlik. In addition to that, there are capabilities that the United States maintains in the region, including aircraft carriers that could supplement any sort of disruption that occurs. And so my understanding is that the pace of operations against ISIL targets has not been affected by some of the turmoil that we have seen in Turkey over the last few days.\nThat said, we've spent a lot of time talking even in this room about how strategically significant the Incirlik Airbase in Turkey is because of its close proximity to Syria. It allows our aircraft, both manned and unmanned, to spend more time over the battlefield. So we certainly have credited the Turks for their partnership and their cooperation in allowing the United States and our coalition partners to use the Incirlik Airbase, and it certainly has enhanced our efforts against ISIL in a way that has had positive national security benefits for Turkey. They're the country that has the long border with Syria, so they certainly are interested in making sure that that pressure is maintained. And we're going to work with them to make sure that we can use the Incirlik Airbase to do exactly that.\nQ: I won't ask you specific figures, but have operations out of Incirlik been curtailed?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that they have not. But I'd check with the Department of Defense and they can give you a specific accounting. If there had been any changes or decline in the numbers, it's been very small and easily compensated by some of the redundancies that I've described. But based on what I have heard, there has not been any significant reduction at all in our ability to use Incirlik Airbase to take strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.\nChip.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Following up on the ISIS issue. With this meeting out at Joint Base Andrews, how big a role does the President play in dealing with the Secretary of Defense in setting the agenda and determining the goals for this meeting? And is this going to be a meeting that is going to end up with a specific plan for the final defeat of ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chip, you may have seen on the President's schedule that he had an opportunity to spend 45 minutes or so in the Oval Office with Secretary Carter just yesterday and he saw Secretary Carter a week or two ago at the NATO Summit in Poland. And since that time, I know Secretary Carter has done a little traveling, including in Iraq, to review our efforts there. So there was an opportunity for the President to meet with the Secretary of Defense in advance of this important meeting that the United States is hosting here.\nThe meeting will bring together defense ministers and chief diplomats of a number of countries -- dozens of countries -- who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition, and they'll have a discussion about what we can do to continue to apply pressure against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. There will be a particular focus on what additional steps need to be taken to take back Mosul.\nObviously, Iraqi security forces have made a lot of important progress in that effort just even in the last few weeks, including the retaking of this particular military airstrip in Iraq known as Qayyarah. That was an important strategic objective and that will serve as an important logistical hub to supply forces that move against Mosul. So all of that was particularly important. I know that there will also be an extensive discussion at the State Department among the diplomats about how to provide additional stabilization in humanitarian support to Iraq.\nAnd you'll recall that one of the chief concerns that President Obama has is making sure that even as Iraqi forces succeed in driving ISIL out of villages and towns and even cities in Iraq, that we're prepared to rebuild, that the Iraqi central government is prepared to rebuild these cities. We know that one of the things that ISIL has done in some of these other communities is essentially, on their way out of town, tried to destroy the basic infrastructure of the community. And the credibility of the Iraqi central government depends upon their ability to mobilize resources and work effectively to rebuild the infrastructure and rebuild these communities so that people can move back into their homes.\nAnd that requires significant sums of money that, quite frankly, the Iraqi central government doesn't have right now. Iraq, like many other countries that relies on energy as an important source of income for their country and as an important export in their economy, is struggling because the price of oil is lower now than it's been in quite a while. So providing this kind of financial support to the Iraqi central government is critical to rebuilding the country of Iraq and building political support for the Iraqi central government. And that political strategy has always been the cornerstone of our broader counter-ISIL effort.\nQ: And somebody has got to ask it -- you said the President probably watched sports rather than the convention on day one. Same thing last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure what he watched on TV last night, but it was not the Republican convention.\nQ: You'll think he'll watch any of it as we move along here?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I don't know. But I'll see if I can find out and try to keep you apprised.\nQ: Have you talked to him about -- have you had a personal conversation with him about the convention at all since yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. I know that he has certainly been following the news coverage of the convention. I just don't know that he's watched much of it firsthand.\nQ: Is there something else you can tell us about that conversation? And a transcript would be nice. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't release a transcript. You might be disappointed in the conversation. But it sounds like on Friday you may have an opportunity to seek his reaction to the week of events in Cleveland.\nKevin.\nQ: Catching up on Netflix. (Laughter.) I want to ask you about -- on a much more serious note -- the radicalization of American women. The U.S. intelligence community is warning law enforcement agencies around the country of a persistent terror threat posed by radicalized Western women. This was in a joint intelligence bulletin. And I'm wondering what that bulletin tells us about the effectiveness of the administration's counterterrorism strategy.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the bulletin, Kevin. But obviously our intelligence community is quite attuned to the strategy that ISIL is undertaking to try to use social media to radicalize people to their cause and even potentially inspire them to carry out acts of violence. And you've heard me refer on a number of occasions to news releases that are issued by the Department of Justice, announcing their success in disrupting plots that could potentially be linked to ISIL. In most cases, these are cases that are not linked directly to ISIL having command and control of these operations, but rather ISIL inspiring individuals to carry out acts of violence.\nAnd periodically, there are announcements from the FBI or the Department of Justice that American women have been detained because they've been attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq and provide support to ISIL fighters by traveling to those countries and taking up arms alongside them as well.\nSo we're certainly mindful of this risk. And the United States has been very focused on developing a strategy that is showing more and more results of countering ISIL's efforts online. And there are somewhat important lessons that's we've learned. The first is that the United States government is not going to be the most credible source of information in pushing back against ISIL. We know that ISIL is an organization that seeks to pervert Islam to advance their ideology, so elevating the voices of Muslim leaders can often be a valuable way, a persuasive way to push back against ISIL's attempts to pervert that religion. That's why the United States has been able to work effectively with Muslim nations like Malaysia and the UAE to house fusion centers that essentially can be the focus of strategic planning for that counter-messaging effort. And that has yielded some important results.\nThe federal government has also been able to work effectively with technology companies. In the past, technology companies have been able to work effectively with the federal government to counter things like child pornography, to prevent social media tools from being used to produce and disseminate child pornography. A similar strategy can be applied to prevent social media from being used to produce and disseminate radicalizing images or messages from ISIL sympathizers. So there are obviously important free speech equities that have to be weighed into this, but there is a template for succeeding on this and we've been able to implement in an effective way.\nSo we've made some progress in this effort. Our efforts have improved. But there is more important work that needs to be done.\nQ: I want to draw your attention to something I crossed a couple weeks ago now. There have been a number of reports of U.S. diplomats being hassled by Russian governments, Russian agents. Is the White House aware of this harassment, continued harassment, not just in Russia but throughout Eastern Europe? And what, if anything, is the administration prepared to do about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I can't speak to any specific case, but I can tell you that the U.S. government and the White House, at the highest levels, is aware of the harassment that some U.S. diplomats have had to endure overseas, and the United States has communicated to the Russian government our strongly held view about how important it is for the Russian government to abide by their responsibility to protect diplomats who are in their country.\nThose views have been communicated in an unambiguous fashion. The President has said on many occasions that the safety and security of Americans serving overseas, whether they're diplomats or servicemembers, is his top priority. And that is certainly true as we register our sincere and serious concerns with Russian officials about the kind of harassment that you've described.\nQ: Forty-seven years ago, man on the moon. Where are we in the U.S. space program? Is the President satisfied with where we are today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my colleagues at NASA I'm sure could document in more detail the important progress that we've made in the space program over the last seven and a half years. But over the last seven and a half years, we've seen an important transition from a space agency that's focused on maintaining a space shuttle, for example, and beginning to start working with private sector groups, private entities, to develop new technology that could allow humans to explore more of the solar system. And the President pursued this approach because it was a more effective use of taxpayer dollars. It had also had the potential to unleash innovation in the private sector in a way that could have positive benefits for the broader economy and certainly positive benefits for those local economies that are closely tied to the space industry.\nWe can certainly get you some more data and metrics that document the important progress that NASA has made in the last seven years.\nQ: Appreciate that. Just one more. Garry Marshall, film luminary, passed away at 81 years old. Any thoughts on his passing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously he is somebody who made a substantial contribution to American pop culture. And there are generations of Americans that were entertained on television and on film by his work. And he certainly is somebody that I think will be fondly remembered by his fans. And so obviously our thoughts and prayers are with his family today.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, a Brexit question. The President has said and you have said, and the Vice President has said, that you want a smooth transition for the UK out of the EU. But all signs right now are pointing to the fact that the new Prime Minister said she's not going to invoke Article 50 this year. Is that too long of a delay in the opinion of the White House? And are there concerns about what the impacts would be on the global and U.S. market?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Karen, the White House and the United States is not going to micromanage this process. This ultimately is about managing the relationship between two of the closest friends and partners of the United States -- specifically, the United Kingdom and European Union. So it is certainly in the interest of the United States for that process to be undertaken in an orderly fashion, mindful of the way that those negotiations could unsettle the global economy. I think both sides are keenly aware of the stakes here. And the good news is that both sides have an interest in undertaking this process responsibly.\nAnd we certainly are going to offer any support or facilitation that's required to ensure that this process is done in an orderly fashion. And the President has communicated that directly to the leaders of the EU and to the newly elected leader of the United Kingdom. And in both those conversations, he received assurances about a commitment to an orderly process. But how that process takes place and when that process take place is something that will be determined by the EU charter and by the decisions made by the negotiating teams on both sides.\nQ: So orderly, responsibly, but you won't say quickly, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the timeline is one that should be determined by parties on both sides of the English Channel.\nQ: And one on -- campaign-related. We've heard the President say that he often hears from foreign leaders and foreign officials who talk to him about this presidential election. The Vice President made some pretty candid comments in Australia, telling people at a town hall, don't worry about our election. And he said, \"The better angels in America will prevail.\" Is it appropriate to be so overtly political and make such an assurance like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the Vice President is offering some reassurance to people around the world who have been a little unsettled by the tone and tenor of the political debate back here in the United States. I didn't see the entirety of the Vice President's remarks, but his effort is to reassure our close allies, including those in Australia, that the United States and the American people are committed to a set of principles that form the basis of our alliances and our relationships with countries around the world. And even despite some of the tension and dysfunction and colorfulness of the political debate, the American people remain committed to those institutions and to those values. And we're hopeful that people around the world, particularly our allies, will be reassured by that.\nBill.\nQ: Back to the question of potentially members of this administration serving in the next one, it's been reported that two Cabinet Secretaries, Tom Vilsack and Tom Perez, both are being considered as vice presidential nominees with Secretary Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports.\nQ: Has the President, in fact, spoken to Secretary Clinton about them? And does he have a favorite?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've acknowledged in the past that President Obama has described his choice of Vice President Biden as the smartest political decision he ever made. And I think people like Secretary Clinton who know President Obama well personally can confirm that he means it when he says it. And the President feels as though he's been extraordinarily well served by the expertise and experience and relationships and loyalty that Vice President Biden has brought to the job.\nSo when you consider how well that turned out, it seems natural that Secretary Clinton might consult President Obama about the process that he undertook to choose Vice President Biden. I'm not going to get into the conversations that they had about them or exactly to what extent those conversations lingered on specific candidates. But obviously the two men that you just named are among those who are considered to be on the short list, and the reason that there is public speculation about their consideration for that important role is at least in part because they've served the country so well in the roles that they have now.\nSo the President is extraordinarily proud of the work that Secretary Vilsack has done at the USDA and the work that Secretary Perez has done at the Department of Labor. These are individuals who are serious, who are focused on the right things. They've got their values in line, and these are two men who have dedicated their lives to public service and they're in it for the right reasons. And so I guess my point is the reason that President Obama entrusted them with the responsibilities that they have now, which are substantial, their success in doing that job is exactly the same reason that people speculate that Secretary Clinton might be inclined to give them even more responsibility.\nQ: It sounds like you're saying on behalf of the President that he is lobbying for one of these two to be the vice presidential nominee as the best way of continuing the stability and continuity with this administration.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not necessarily. I mean, I think -- you didn't ask me about Senator Kaine, but obviously he's somebody else who's --\nQ: He's not a member of the administration.\nMR. EARNEST: He's not a member of the administration -- that is true. But he is somebody who is the subject of some rather intense public speculation about --\nQ: I'm just asking about --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, but I guess the thing is I think the President would consider Senator Kaine -- to adopt your terminology there -- one of his as well. Senator Kaine was one of the first public officials to announce a public endorsement of Senator Obama. Senator Kaine served as the chair of the DNC during President Obama's first year in office. And Senator Kaine is somebody that the President deeply respects and I think it's been publicly reported even considered himself as a running mate back in 2008.\nQ: Any one of the three. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the point is that all of these individuals have fulfilled their responsibilities quite well. They've distinguished themselves. And the President is pleased that all three of them have distinguished themselves in serving the public while President Obama has been in office and while President Obama has been President. He has benefitted from their leadership and their good service to the administration and to the country. And so I don't know if the President has a specific favorite, but I know the President is extraordinarily proud of all three of those individuals. But, ultimately, he is going to defer to Secretary Clinton to make the decision that she believes is best.\nJuliet.\nQ: Just to follow up a bit on that, continuing with this idea of these three figures, all of whom are just such close political allies of the President and also when you see the overlap between current and former members of, say, this administration and former Secretary of State Clinton's team. If you have to describe what that synergy looks like and to what extent, when Americans are thinking about who their next President is, how close is the overlap between the White House and the Clinton campaign and a future Clinton administration at this point? To what extent is it is a continuation of the President's term?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are some limits to how I can answer your question, in part because Secretary Clinton is going to describe what kind of President she will be. She will describe what agenda she will pursue and she will describe the values that she will rely on in setting that agenda. And so she should do that.\nSo that's why it's hard to assess from here how closely the vision that she will describe is to the record of President Obama. But I think what I can say are a couple of things. The first is, President Obama, in offering his endorsement of Secretary Clinton, has talked about how he has seen firsthand her skills and her values, both as a candidate for President and as a Secretary of State. And the President obviously has enormous regard for Secretary Clinton and her leadership abilities. And he spoke at length about that a couple of weeks ago in Charlotte.\nSecretary Clinton herself has said publicly that she's interested in building on a lot of the progress that this administration has made. She's interested in continuing the work to raise wages, raise the minimum wage, fight for equal pay, increase funding for job training and education in a way that we can ensure that middle-class families in the United States are getting a fair shot at success, even in a 21st century global economy.\nWe've seen Secretary Clinton talk about how important it is to build on the progress that we've made in digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession [Depression]. We've seen Secretary Clinton talk about how important it is to build on the new foundation that's been laid by Obamacare. She believes that there are some improvements that can be made, some tweaks that can be made. But she is interested in building on that progress, not tearing it down like Republicans have advocated.\nShe is certainly a strong believer in things like the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. She is committed to implementing the climate change deal that was reached at the end of last year. So I think based on all of that, I think that you can rightly assess that the values and priorities of President Obama and Secretary Clinton overlap.\nThat said, people in this room have not hesitated to highlight situations or particular aspects of her agenda that differ from President Obama. And that's natural. She's somebody with her own views, her own perspectives, and there may be some places where there's a little bit of a different view. She's going to be her own President if, in fact, she is elected. And, again, the President has talked about the value of fresh legs and a new perspective in the Oval Office after the last eight years.\nBut the President is interested in that fresh perspective and those fresh legs being a part of someone who is committed to building on all the important progress that we've made over the last seven years. And that certainly is why President Obama has been so enthusiastic in his support of Secretary Clinton's campaign. And you'll obviously hear him talk a little bit more about this next week.\nQ: And just briefly on next week, you mentioned that the President has not been closely watching every night the Republican convention. Do you expect that he will be regularly tuning into the DNC, again, before he goes there? Can you just talk about how you think he'll be watching that event?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm confident that he'll watch the night that his wife speaks. Just get that on the record right away. (Laughter.) So we've got that box checked. Obviously he'll be speaking one of the nights. My expectation is that he would watch at least part of Secretary Clinton's speech when she delivers the speech accepting the Democratic nomination for President.\nQ: Just a part? (Laughter.)\nQ: -- switching channels?\nMR. EARNEST: Channel surfing, maybe a little bit. No, I suspect that he'll watch that speech as well. The other night, I don't know, I can't account for that. So we'll try to update you when that night arrives.\nMike.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. It is next Wednesday night that the President will be speaking. Can you talk a bit about what he sees as his role at the convention? Is it to defend his own record, make a case for Secretary Clinton? How does he balance those two? And are there any insights you can share into the speechwriting process -- how far along it is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that -- I can tell you that the speechwriting process has begun, but I think the President would be the first to say that he feels like there's still a lot of work that needs to be done to get that in shape. So I would anticipate that he'll be working on that over the course of this week and over the weekend.\nSo with that in mind, I can tell you that certainly part of the speech will be devoted to laying out the values and priorities that President Obama has been fighting for over the last seven years and underscore how important it is that that fight continues. By focusing on the middle class, by focusing on how the United States can advance our interests around the world, including through the use of diplomacy, has yielded a lot of progress for the country.\nOur country is more prosperous and safer than when President Obama took office. And the President believes strongly that we can't afford to flush that progress down the drain. It's so important that the next President is somebody with the judgment and skill, experience, leadership to build on that progress. And that's the overarching case that the President will make, and I think it's the kind of case that the President hopes will resonate not just with Democrats who are committed to progressive values, but also among Americans that may not have a deep attachment to one party or the other.\nSo obviously the core of the President's agenda and his speech will be those progressive values. But he believes that there's a very strong case to make, even to Americans that aren't registered Democrats but are concerned about making sure that the next generation of Americans has an opportunity to succeed in the same way that previous generations have. The President is enormously confident about that. The President is bullish on the prospects of future generations of Americans. And he'll have an opportunity to describe why.\nQ: Considering what you said about his own viewing habits this week, is there a degree to which his speech might change or his thoughts about what he might want to say will change, based on how the rest of the RNC proceeds? It's been starkly negative, a lot of what we've heard on stage. I don't think \"Lucifer\" has been referred to in a primetime speech before.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at least not at a political convention -- maybe at a -- well, maybe somewhere else. Maybe on a different channel. No, I do not anticipate the President making any changes to his speech or to his plans to deliver remarks based on anything that's said by anybody at the Republican convention.\nQ: And lastly, is there an event at the White House that you've seen that you're looking forward to more than what will happen tomorrow here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's hard to imagine -- (laughter) -- something more exciting than having the World Series Champion Kansas City Royals visit the White House. Look, I think what's true is that there's -- serendipity has led us to a situation where a rare Royals World Series Championship has coincided with my tenure at the White House. And so I'm obviously incredibly excited about that and really looking forward to tomorrow.\nQ: George Brett --\nMR. EARNEST: Hopefully so. We'll see.\nFred.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. One convention question. I've got a couple. But with regards to the convention, the platform calls for the end of the Johnson Amendment, which would basically allow churches to -- or pastors to endorse candidates from the pulpit. Does the White House have any thoughts on that type of rule?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the language that's included in the platform. I think I would just reiterate something I think the President has said, which is that one of the founding values of the country is the separation of church and state, both to ensure that state interests are not interfered with by religious authorities, but also to make sure that state interests are not interfering with the work of religious authorities. So the President believes that both our institutions of state and our institutions of religion in the United States both benefit significantly from observing that principle.\nQ: Something I wanted to share with you -- Senator Sasse and Senator Lee have put forward a reform bill on occupational licensing. That's something that the White House has supported, some type of reform there. Would the White House, President Obama, support the Lee-Sasse bill?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the details of their specific legislative proposal. But you're right that there are a number of executive actions that this administration has taken to try to streamline occupational licensing in a way that would make our economy more efficient. I know that one area where the administration has done a lot of work on this has to do with military veterans. There are a number of individuals who serve in the United States military who developed a set of skills that have been very valuable in their service to the country and would be quite valuable in the private sector.\nAnd in some cases, the transfer of those skills to the private sector has been impeded by overly burdensome regulations. And streamlining that process and facilitating the ability of our veterans to work in the private sector and use those skills in the private sector is something the administration has been quite focused on, both because it could improve the economic opportunity for veterans, but also could strengthen our economy.\nSo again, I haven't looked at the specific legislative proposal that's been forward, but there are some interesting things that the administration has been able to do using the President's executive authority. So look, that's something that they're interested in talking to the White House about. I'm sure they'd get their phone call returned.\nQ: And just one last question. Last week, PolitiFact determined as mostly false President Obama's comment that it's easier to get a Glock than a book. The Washington Post fact-checker made a similar conclusion on that same point. Does the President actually believe that as fact, or does he say that kind of metaphorically to say -- to demonstrate how easy it is to get a gun?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would just say is, with all due respect to the fact-checkers, when the President delivered that line to a room full of about a thousand cops, there was not a lot of evident disagreement. I think there is genuine concern on the mind of -- in the minds of law enforcement officials who work in these economically disadvantaged communities about how readily accessible illegal guns are and, frankly, how hard it is for kids in that community to get access to a quality education, or get access to high-quality educational opportunities that would eventually allow them to escape that neighborhood.\nAnd the point that the President was making is, rather than mobilize an effective policy response to that situation by increasing funding for schools or passing common-sense gun control legislation, too often -- at least in this Republican Congress -- those obvious solutions have been rejected, and as a result we've just asked law enforcement to deal with the problem. And we put law enforcement officers and police officers in a position where they're the ones that have to be the director of the after-school program or the drug counselor or the mental health professional. And that's not fair, particularly when you consider they're trying to fight crime in a dangerous neighborhood. So adding that burden to law enforcement is not fair.\nAnd I guess Darlene started out this briefing by talking about what are some of the steps that we can take to make the job of our law enforcement officers safer. One of the things that we could do is to ease the burden on law enforcement and make the kinds of investments in these communities that we know will have a tangible impact on the kind of opportunity that's available to kids that are growing up in these communities.\nGoyal, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two questions. One, as far as this summit on counterterrorism is concerned by the President and the Secretary of Defense and State, and -- defense ministers and also diplomatic security officials will be there. My question is that now ISIL, or ISIS, is spreading beyond these countries who will be at this summit. Do you think the President is going to meet all those countries where ISIL is spreading or will be spreading? And also, they are brainwashing the young people, (inaudible) money and other facilities on social media or Internet. And this requires much education for all the young people in those countries. My question is now, that they need money and they are buying -- they are sending the stolen oil and also buying arms. Are you going, or U.S. or these countries are going after those who are supplying them arms and buying their stolen oil?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Goyal, let me just start out by saying that there are 40 nations that are represented at this conference, and many nations chose to send both their top diplomat as well as their defense minister. There will also be a number of multilateral organizations like the United Nations, NATO, EU and Interpol, who will also be a part of these discussions.\nAnd all of these organizations and these countries have made substantial contributions that benefit our fight against ISIL that is certainly focused on Iraq and Syria. This is the location where ISIL is attempting to form a caliphate. But we've seen that the mythology of that caliphate is being exposed for that it is. And that's because of the success that Iraqi forces have enjoyed in driving ISIL out of about 48 percent of the territory that they previously occupied in Iraq. The percentage of territory in Syria is a little bit smaller, but there have been important gains against ISIL, even in Syria, based on the success that our coalition has had in backing the efforts of fighters on the ground.\nAnd the thinking has been that so much of the ISIL ideology that is promoted around the world on social media is rooted in the idea that they are on the verge of establishing a caliphate. And that's why the international community has been focused on the effort of debunking that myth and depriving ISIL of the ability to have land on which they can organize and establish a caliphate. And we've made a lot of important progress in that regard.\nAt the same time, the United States and our coalition partners have been prepared to take strikes against ISIL targets in other areas where concern has arisen. We've talked in the past about a couple of the strikes that have been taken against ISIL targets in Libya. We've talked a little bit about strikes that the United States has taken against ISIL targets in Afghanistan, and we'll continue to be mindful of risks that may emanate from other places that are related to ISIL and make sure that we can confront them.\nQ: As far as this campaign is concerned, Madam Secretary Clinton was speaking last week at NOVA, Northern Virginia Community College, with Senator Tim Kaine. And she declared a number of things. One was that if she's elected President, she will make community colleges free for all, and all the young people will be out with the teachings of basics they need in their life, and that will help them out of these troubles and all that. And also, at the same time, she said that she will not have any taxes on the middle class, among other things. So are there any comments from the President when she's laying down all these -- future presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the two examples that you've cited are obviously consistent with some of the proposals that President Obama has put forward. So in his State of the Union address in 2015, President Obama laid out a clear proposal for giving hardworking students access to a free community college education based on a program that was actually pioneered by the Republican Governor of Tennessee. This is a proposal that had bipartisan support across the country, but unfortunately is not supported by Republicans in Washington, D.C. -- even though we've seen in Tennessee that it's been really good for their economy and really good for the middle class.\nAs it relates to taxes, the President has a strong record on this in terms of protecting and making permanent tax cuts for the middle class, even as we ask those at the top of the income scale to pay a little bit more. And the President certainly believes that there's more that we could do when it comes to closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected.\nQ: Finally, as far as education is concerned, when President Obama and Dr. Manmohan Singh initiative on education was signed between the U.S. and India, where does that stand now after --\nMR. EARNEST: We'll get you an update. Obviously the connections between the United States and India include students in the United States that study abroad in India, and Indian students that study abroad in the United States. And so obviously that's just one measure of the important relationship between our two countries. But as it relates to the specific proposal, we can follow up with you with some more specific information.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:18 P.M.

{"author": "Ted Cruz", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118041", "text": "Thank you, and god bless each and every one of you.\nHeidi and I are so honored to join you here in Cleveland where LeBron James just lead an incredible comeback victory, and I am convinced America is going to come back too.\nI want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.\nAnd, like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November.\nConventions are times of excitement, but given the events of the last few weeks I hope you'll allow me a moment to talk to you about what's really at stake. Just two weeks ago a nine-year-old girl named Caroline was living a carefree Texas summer. Swimming in the pool, playing with friends, doing all the things a happy child might do. Like most children, she relied upon the love that she received from her mom, Heidi, and her dad, a police sergeant named Michael Smith.\nThat is until he became one of the five police officers gunned down in Dallas.\nThe day her father was murdered, Caroline gave him a hug and a kiss as he left for work, but as they parted her dad asked her something he hadn't asked before. \"What if this is the last time you ever kiss or hug me?\"\nLater, as she thought of her fallen father, and that last heart breaking hug, Caroline broke down into tears. How could anything ever be OK again? Michael Smith was a former Army Ranger who spent decades with the Dallas police department. I have no idea who he voted for in the last election, or what he thought about this once, but his life was a testament to devotion.\nHe protected the very protesters who mocked him because he loved his country, and his fellow man. His work gave new meaning to that line from literature, \"To die of love is to live by it.\"\nAs I thought about what I wanted to say tonight, Michael Smith's story weighed on my heart. Maybe That's because his daughter Caroline is about the same age as my eldest daughter, and happens to share the same name. Maybe it's because I saw a video of that dear, sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her Daddy's last question to her.\nMaybe it's because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil in places like Orlando, and Paris, and Nice, and Baton Rouge. Maybe it's because of the simple question itself. What if this right now is our last time? Our last moment to do something for our families, and our country? Did we live up to the values we say we believe? Did we do all we really could?\nThat's really what elections should be about. That's why you and millions like you devoted so much time and sacrifice to this campaign. We're fighting not for one particular candidate, or one campaign, but because each of wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids, our own Caroline's, that we did our best for their future and our country.\nAmerica is more than just a land mass between two oceans, America is an ideal. A simple, yet powerful ideal. Freedom matters.\nFor much of human history government power has been the unavoidable constant in life. Government decrees and the people obey, but not here. We have no king or queen, we have no dictator, we the people constrain government.\nOur nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most beautiful and powerful words in the English language, \"I want to be free.\"\nNever has that message been more needed than today. We stand here tonight a nation divided. Partisan rancor, anger, even hatred are tearing America apart. And citizens are furious, rightly furious, at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises, and that ignores the will of the people.\nWe have to do better. We owe our fallen heroes more than that.\nNow, of course, Obama and Clinton will also tell you that they care about our children's future, and I want to believe them but there is a profound difference about our two party's vision for the future.\nThere's is the part that thinks ISIS is a J.V. team, that responds to the death of Americans in Benghazi, \"What difference does it make?\" And, that thinks it's possible to make a deal with Iran that celebrates its holidays, \"Death to America Day,\" and, \"Death to Israel Day.\"\nMy friends, this is madness. President Obama is a man who does everything backwards. He wants to close Guantanamo Bay, and open up our borders. He exports jobs, and imports terrorists. Enough is enough.\nAnd, I am here to tell you there is a better vision for our future. A return to freedom.\nOn education your freedom to choose your child's education, even if you aren't as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.\nOn healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor without Obamacare.\nOn taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.\nThe Internet? Keep it free from taxes, free from regulation and don't give it away to Russia and China.\nFreedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.\nFreedom means religious freedom, whether you are Christian, Jew, Muslim, or atheist.\nWhether you are gay, or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience.\nFreedom means the right to keep and bear arms, and to protect your family.\nFreedom means that every human life is precious and must be protected.\nFreedom means Supreme Court Justices who don't dictate policy, but instead follow the Constitution.\nAnd, freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values. Colorado might decide something different than Texas. New York different than Iowa. That's the way it's supposed to be, diversity.\nIf not, what's the point of having states to begin with?\nNow, Hillary Clinton believes that government should make virtually every choice in your life. Education, health care, marriage, speech, all dictated out of Washington. But, something powerful is happening, we've seen it in both parties, we've seen it in the United Kingdom's unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union.\nVoters are overwhelmingly rejecting the political establishment, and overwhelmingly rejecting big government.\nThat is a profound victory and it is one earned by each and every one of you. People are fed up with politicians who don't listen to them. Fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites instead of working men and women.\nWe deserve an immigration system that puts America first, and yes, builds a wall to keep America safe.\nA government that stops admitting ISIS terrorists as refugees. We deserve trade policies that put the interests of American farmers over the interests that are funding the lobbyists.\nAnd, if we stand together and choose freedom, our future will be brighter. Freedom will bring back jobs and raise wages. Freedom will lift people out of dependency to the dignity of work.\nWe can do this. Forty-Seven years ago to this day, America put the very first man on the moon.\nThat was the power of freedom. Our party, the Republican party, was founded to defeat slavery.\nAbraham Lincoln, the first Republican president signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\nTogether we passed the Civil Rights Act, and together we fought to eliminate Jim Crow Laws.\nThat's our collective legacy, although the media will never share it with you. Those were fights for freedom, and so is this.\nSergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom. So do the soldiers, and sailors, and airmen, and Marines everyday fighting radical Islamic terrorism.\nAnd, so did the family of Alton Sterling who bravely called to end the violence. So did the families of those murdered at the Charleston-Emanuel AME Church who forgave that hateful, bigoted, murder.\nAnd, so can we. We deserve leaders who stand for principle, who unite us all behind shared values, who cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect from everybody. And, to those listening, please don't stay home in November.\nIf you love our country, and love our children as much as you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom, and to be faithful to the constitution.\nI appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.\nAnd I will tell you that it is love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams. Like my mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my dad, who's here tonight, who fled prison and torture in Cuba. Coming to Texas with just $100 dollars sewn into his underwear.\nAnd it is over that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving nine- year-old girl in Dallas, and God willing, propel her to move forward, and dream, and soar, and make her daddy proud. We must make the most of our moments, to fight for freedom, to protect our God given rights, even if those with whom we don't agree so that when we are old and grey, and when our work is done, and when we give those we love one final kiss goodbye we will be able to say freedom matters and I was part of something beautiful.\nThe case we have to make to the American people, the case each person in this room has to make to the American people is to commit to each of them that we will defend freedom, and be faithful to the Constitution.\nWe will unite the party; we will unite the country by standing together for shared values by standing for liberty. God bless each and every one of you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-07-20", "title": "Remarks to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio"}

We took the power from the hands of the big government special interests and returned it firmly into the hands of the hard working tax payers.

They spent tens of millions of dollars trying to defeat us in a recall election, but we didn't back down and we won. Three times, three times, they came at us, three times we won. We won because our common sense reforms worked. Today more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before. Our budget is balanced and responsible.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118063", "text": "Building on Over a Half Century of U.S. Leadership\nOver the past eight years, President Obama has elevated sustainable development to a core pillar of American foreign policy. On Wednesday July 20th, the President will host the White House Summit on Global Development, bringing together development leaders, public and private sector financing partners, civil society, diplomats, and entrepreneurs to mark our global progress and catalyze further development efforts.\nBuilding on more than a half century of global leadership, including the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) under President George W. Bush, President Obama issued the first and a new U.S. Global Development Policy in 2010. For the first time, global development was elevated, on par with diplomacy and defense, as a core pillar of American engagement. The President's policy set forth a vision that places a premium on many of the principles and objectives endorsed by the international community last year in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: sustained and inclusive economic growth; democratic governance; game-changing innovations; leveraging new partners and multiple sources of development financing; and building sustainable systems to meet basic human needs.\nThe President's signature development initiatives reflect these principles and a new way of doing business. Feed the Future has generated significant reductions in poverty and malnutrition, Power Africa has set the stage for the steady flow of private sector investments in an expanding energy sector and our investments in global health have yielded reductions in maternal and child mortality, reductions in malaria incidence and lethality, and the promise of an AIDS-free generation. Across these and other efforts, and as mandated by the President's policy, our investments in development reflect increased and more strategic collaboration between and among a broad array of U.S. government departments and agencies.\nReal Lives, Real Outcomes\nFood security and nutrition. In response to the spike in world food prices, President Obama called for a global food security initiative at the London G20 Summit in 2009. His continued leadership led to the more than doubling of donor assistance to agricultural development, renewed investments in research, and a commitment, embraced by the United Nations, to invest in the comprehensive country plans designed by developing countries. The President's leadership and the Feed the Future initiative have placed food security high on the world's agenda, and generated significant results, including:\n• In 2015, Feed the Future helped over 9 million smallholder farmers, food producers, and rural families adopt innovations and new practices to improve agricultural productivity. In turn, these farmers—many of them women—boosted their incomes by more than $800 million.\n• Feed the Future has reached nearly 18 million children with vital nutrition interventions in 2015, and new data show that childhood stunting has dropped between 12 to 32 percent and poverty has decreased between 12 to 26 percent over recent years in several areas where Feed the Future works.\n• Since 2013, the Administration has supported the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN), which with over 300 partners makes agricultural and nutritionally relevant data available, accessible, and usable for unrestricted use.\nComplementing our bilateral efforts, the United States led a multilateral effort to launch the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) in 2009, which has since allocated $1.4 billion to date to 25 low-income countries to help boost agricultural productivity. With other G-7 countries and African leaders, President Obama in 2012 launched the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition which has fostered policy reforms that have mobilized $10 billion in private sector investment commitments.\nGlobal Health.\nUnder President Obama's leadership, the United States has generated sweeping results, including:\n• Building on the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief launched by President George W. Bush, our efforts mean that an AIDS-free generation is now within sight. Since 2009, the number of people receiving life-saving treatment through PEPFAR has increased from nearly 2.5 million to 9.5 million at the end of 2015; 1.5 million babies have been born AIDS-free to mothers infected with HIV/AIDS, and the United States is positioned to realize President Obama's commitment to meet the bold new target of 12.9 million people on treatment by 2017 and to reduce new HIV infections among adolescent girls.\n• The U.S. government is now the largest donor to global malaria efforts worldwide. Over the past 15 years, through US government investments in the President's Malaria Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, and partnerships, an estimated 6.2 million malaria deaths have been averted.\n• The Obama Administration has challenged the world to end preventable child and maternal deaths, and since 2008 helped save the lives of 4.6 million children and 200,000 mothers. U.S. contributions to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance have helped to immunize more than 500 million kids and help prevent more than 7 million deaths. With a relentless focus on neglected tropical diseases, the United States has leveraged more than $11 billion in donated medicines, reaching nearly 700 million people with essential medicines. We have made tremendous progress in the fight to eradicate polio, and we are close to wiping this disease off the face of the earth, forever.\n• Before the first cases of Ebola came to light in West Africa, President Obama launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to drive a worldwide effort to ensure that all countries can prevent, detect and respond to health threats and can meet the requirements of international health regulations. The Administration proceeded to work with partners to defeat the first-ever Ebola epidemic while also mobilizing commitments to help build the capacity of our partners. The United States has committed to assist at least 31 countries to achieve the GHSA targets and to build national, regional, and international capability to address infectious disease threats, and  G-7 Leaders have now matched this commitment by collectively pledging to assist 76 countries and regions.\nPower Africa. President Obama launched Power Africa in 2013 with a goal of doubling access to energy in sub-Saharan Africa. To do so, Power Africa was built to combine the tools from across U.S. departments and agencies needed to facilitate private sector investment in Africa's energy sector. Power Africa thus not only delivers investments that can yield increased electricity, it also strengthens local capacity, helps foster a strong investment climate, and mitigates risk. With an initial commitment by the Obama Administration of $7 billion in assistance and other financing, Power Africa has leveraged public and private sector commitments to invest nearly $43 billion in power generation and distribution across sub-Saharan Africa. Through Power Africa, the United States is working together with a range of partners to accelerate private-sector energy transactions, by leveraging the assistance, financing, commercial and diplomatic tools of the U.S. Government, as well as by leveraging the tools and expertise of our bilateral and multilateral partners, including the African Development Bank, the World Bank Group, and the Governments of Sweden, the European Union, the UK, Norway and Canada, and more than 100 private-sector partners. Additional achievements include:\n• Since its launch, Power Africa has provided support to projects expected to generate up to 29,000 megawatts. This includes projects expected to generate 4,600 megawatts of electricity that have already reached financial close, which are expected to generate over 2.5 million new connections to electricity.\n• Three years after the launch of Power Africa, several U.S. Government departments and agencies have announced expanded Power Africa commitments. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) exceeded its original $1.5 billion commitment 18 months early and has since pledged an additional $1 billion. To date, OPIC is supporting 19 projects, including utility scale power plans, off-grid and small-scale renewable projects and microfinance and investment facilities, in support of Power Africa.\n• The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has nearly doubled its initial $1 billion commitment and is implementing power compacts in Ghana, Malawi, Benin, Liberia and an energy sector threshold program in Sierra Leone.\n• The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has increased its energy portfolio in Africa by over 300 percent, supporting projects with the potential to provide electricity to up to 1.7 million households. The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF), in partnership with USAID and GE Africa, has awarded 50 grants to local entrepreneurs for a total of $5.0 million in grant support through the Power Africa Off-Grid Energy Challenge.\nThe Power Africa Roadmap released in 2016 outlines Power Africa's plan for adding 30,000 megawatts and 60 million new electrical connections by 2030 through the combined efforts of Power Africa's more than 120 public and private sector partners. In February 2016, President Obama signed the bipartisan Electrify Africa Act of 2015 into law, which codifies the Power Africa approach and ensures this work will extend well beyond this Administration. Building on Power Africa's vision and leadership, a number of new initiatives have emerged that seek to address Africa's energy challenges and further accelerate progress towards our shared goal of expanding energy.\nChanging the Way We Do Business. In the face of extraordinary global challenges, the Obama Administration has reshaped the U.S. approach to development, including by:\nCatalyzing private investment and other sources of financing\nAcross these initiatives and more broadly, the Obama Administration has acted on our recognition that sustainable development outcomes require multiple streams of financing, including domestic resources, private capital and assistance. Under the Obama Administration, the United States has committed and helped mobilize more than $100 billion in new funding from other donors and the private sector to fight poverty in the areas of health, food security, and energy.\nUnder this Administration, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Government's development finance institution, has supported more than $35 billion in private investment in developing and emerging markets. The new projects that OPIC has supported since 2002, when the Monterrey Consensus was agreed, are expected to yield close to $82 billion in private investment. Since its establishment in 2004, the Millennium Challenge Corporation's (MCC) $10 billion grant portfolio has leveraged nearly $5 billion in private-sector investment and more than $450 million in partner country contributions.\nAnd in 2015, the United States, along with other development partners, launched the Addis Tax Initiative, a partnership to help developing countries better mobilize and effectively use their own domestic resources to finance development.\nTransparency, accountability, and open government\nSince President Obama's first day in office, when he signed the  Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, the Administration's policies have been rooted in the belief that greater transparency and accountability are essential to advancing progress at home and abroad. In 2010, we launched the ForeignAssistance.gov website to track U.S. foreign assistance which now contains now contains $30 billion of annual programming data across U.S. agencies that implement foreign assistance. MCC has developed a state of the art capacity to conduct impact evaluations, and USAID, operationalizing its rigorous 2011 Evaluation Policy, has increased the number and quality of evaluations to over 200 per year, all of which are published online. The U.S. has also helped advance increased transparency and accountability internationally through the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, the International Aid Transparency Initiative, and the \"Grand Bargain\" crafted at the World Humanitarian Summit.\nPresident Obama in 2011 joined with seven other heads of state to launch the Open Government Partnership (OGP), a global partnership between governments and civil society to advance transparency and accountability, bolster citizen engagement, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. OGP now serves as a platform for reformers in 70 countries. In its first five years, OGP countries made more than 2,500 specific commitments through National Action Plans to improve governance and public participation for some two billion people worldwide. In partnership with civil society groups across the country, the United States is implementing its third national action plan with commitments across 20 U.S. agencies.\nLast year, the U.S. established the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (Global Data Partnership), a network of over 150 members from government, civil society, business, international organizations, and academia to help countries employ data to help achieve the SDGs. MCC partnered with experts from civil society, development, philanthropic communities, and the private sector to establish the first-of-its-kind Governance Data Alliance to fill governance data gaps and ensure that the data being created meets the needs of those who use it most. And USTDA's Global Procurement Initiative: Understanding Best Value enables partner countries to select high-quality goods and services that foster sustainable infrastructure development in a fair and transparent manner.\nBroadening partnerships\nThis Administration has piloted a new vision of development by leveraging an expanding array of new and non-traditional partners, including to harness cutting-edge technologies, accelerate research, and scale innovations to support sustainable development. Founded in 2014, USAID's Global Development Lab brings together diverse partners to find tools, innovations, and approaches that help reach development objectives more effectively and sustainably. In partnership with other development organizations and the private sector, in 2014, USAID launched the $200 million Global Innovation Fund, which invests in piloting, testing, and scaling proven social innovations that aim to improve the lives and opportunities of millions of people in the developing world. In 2015 alone, USAID maintained over 360 active public-private partnerships that, over their active lifetimes, have leveraged more than $5.9 billion from private sector and other partners.\nThe Administration has also reached beyond traditional development partners in seeking fresh thinking. In 2012, the President established the Global Development Council to reach into the private sector, academia, and philanthropic institutions and beyond to seek out external expertise in emerging issues in global development. USAID launched the Grand Challenges for Development initiative in order to spur new ideas from new people and harness the transformational effects of science; to date, eight Grand Challenge efforts are underway tackling challenges ranging from off-grid energy to combating Zika.\nFostering Future Leadership\nThe next generation of leaders will ultimately be responsible for their countries' success, and President Obama has long emphasized the importance of supporting these future leaders. In December 2011, President Obama established the Young African Leadership Initiative (YALI), which is already helping to develop Africa's next generations of leaders, and the Administration is supporting similar work in Southeast Asia through the Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative (YSEALI) and in Latin America and the Caribbean with the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative (YLAI).  These programs help the next generation of leaders develop the skills and opportunities to advance their countries and regions through government leadership, strengthening civil society, and business and entrepreneurship.\nIn March 2015, the President and the First Lady launched Let Girls Learn, which brings together the Department of State, USAID, the Peace Corps, and MCC to address the challenges preventing adolescent girls from attaining a quality education that empowers them to reach their full potential. Let Girls Learn expands education opportunities for adolescent girls, including in areas of conflict and crisis. By leveraging public-private partnerships and commitments from multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, Let Girls Learn improves the lives of adolescent girls worldwide. Let Girls Learn extends its partnership to foreign governments, such as Canada, Mexico, Jordan, and Pakistan in this effort. The U.S. is also collaborating closely with Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom, who have collectively pledged nearly $600 million towards girls' education globally.", "timestamp": "2016-07-20", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama's Commitment to Global Development"}

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121175", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: We have an expression in American politics, as the Prime Ministers know -- that if my mother were she'd wonder who you were talking about and my father would have believed it.\nGood afternoon, everyone. And I want to thank you, Simon and Michael, for this warm welcome. And I want to thank everyone at the U.S. Centre at the University of Sydney and at the Lowy Institute for organizing this opportunity for me to speak here today.\nAnd I want to say at the start to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of this beautiful land, the First Australians,\nthe oldest continuous culture in the world, and to pay our respects to their Elders, past and present.\nIt is not hyperbole to suggest I'm truly honored that several of your former Prime Ministers are here this morning. My service in government overlaps each of their services -- much less consequential, my service to theirs. But I watched with great interest, pride, and satisfaction how this chain, how this link between the United States and Australia was husbanded by each of you. And it's an overwhelming testament to your great hospitality here that the three of you would be here to hear me speak.\nPrime Minister Hawke, Prime Minister Howard, Prime Minister Abbott, I want to thank you for your contributions to the strengthening of our relationship of our two nations during each of your tenures.\nOver the past few days -- both here in Sydney and in Melbourne -- I've had the opportunity to speak with Australians from all walks of life. At the stadium, I was with World War II veterans and active duty Australian Defence Forces here; cancer researchers and conservation experts; entrepreneurs striking out to start their own ventures and factory workers contributing to the global manufacturing operation.\n1Like Americans, Australians all have different hopes and different dreams, different worries about the future, but there's something they all have in common. And I'm not talking about the borderline obsession with Australian Rules Football.\nThe ambassador and I enjoyed our stay there. He kept looking at me like, do I understand what's going on? (Laughter.) I understood. I had watched matches on television before. I played American college football and in law school, I played rugby. And I turned to one of my granddaughters who was with me, my 12-year-old, and I said -- I had her watch a game before we went to the game. And she said, Pop, it's kind of like basketball because you bounce the ball when you run. It's kind of like basketball, soccer, rugby, football. And, Pop, the end of the field is oval -- it's kind of like ice hockey. (Laughter.) So it is one incredible sport requiring incredible athleticism. And I had a chance to see one of the games.\nBut that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about character. In my view, Australians are defined by their character; by the grit, their integrity, their unyielding resilience that has shaped this nation from the very beginning.\nAnd it's that character, in my view, which has always drawn Australians and Americans together -- because we recognize it I believe in one another.\nIn December 1941, besieged by war, facing an advancing enemy, Prime Minister John Curtain issued the now-famous message to the Australian people, a message that declared an intention to close the distance between our two nations and bridge the wide Pacific.\nHe said: Without inhibitions of any kind … Australia looks to America.\nAustralia looked to America, and a generation of Americans—including two of my uncles responded. Both in New Guinea -- one killed and one went home badly injured.\nAustralia opened her hearth and her heart to the 1st Marine Division after Guadalcanal, including Ambassador Berry's 19-year-old father. And they found rest and embrace in Australia, camping on the Melbourne Cricket Grounds. I read when I spoke to this veterans' group, I read some of the letters that were written. One of the letters from a Marine who made it off of Guadalcanal onto that field for rest said the thing he looked forward to the most and he appreciated the most was the \"love and the embrace\" of the Australian people. Not words often used by U.S. Marines.\nThey spoke of Australia as a second home. And to this day, the 1st Marine Division, a proud, proud division of our United States Marine Corps deploys to Waltzing Matilda.\nOver the course of 100 years spent fighting side by side, over 65 years of a formal alliance, although every testing -- through every testing we have faced as a nation, Australians and Americans have built an unsurpassed partnership. Our peoples joined in easy mateship. The history that forged the foundations of our alliance in iron and baptized it in blood has long bound the fortunes of our two nations.\nBut I didn't fly all the way from Washington to revel in past glories. And it's important that nostalgia not be the defining feature of our partnership. I'm here because that partnership is a living connection between our two countries -- as vital in our current era of change and uncertainty as it was a century ago in the trenches of World War I, as it was 75 years ago when together we defeated the forces of fascism. Our alliance has been shaped by progress of our shared home in the Asia Pacific. And it's been for decades -- underwriting stability, seeding commerce, laying the groundwork for this region to reach its great potential.\nAnd here in the early years of what surely will be the\nPacific century, it's critical that America and Australia continue to look to one another for mutual support. Because together I am absolutely confident we can write a better future for all our children and for this whole region.\nThat's why President Obama came to Australia five years ago once we decided on our policy of rebalance to Asia. In his address to the Parliament in Canberra, he declared before the world: \"In the Asia Pacific in the 21st century, the United States of America is all in.\" The United States is all in.\nAnd we've made good on that promise and continue to make good on that promise. We've shown our commitment to lead in the region over and over again.\nAnyone who questions America's dedication and staying power in the Asia Pacific simply is not paying attention.\nOur commitment to our military strength is unparalleled. We continue to outpace our competitors, spending more on our overall defense than the next eight nations in the world combined. We have the most capable ground forces in the world, an unmatched ability to project naval and air power to any and every corner of the globe and simultaneously. We've bolstered our special operations forces, enhanced our cyber and space capabilities, invested in game-changing technologies in order to maintain our qualitative edge for years to come. And we've committed to put over 60 percent of our fleet and our most advanced military capabilities in the Pacific by 2020.\nAt the same time, we're stronger and more effective when we work side-by-side with our closest and most trusted partners, with those nations who share our interests, our concerns, and our commitment to upholding a rules-based international order.\nThat means, even as we continue to address the full range of persistent challenges and immediate threats to our shared security, the United States has kept -- and will keep -- a laser focus on the future in the Asia Pacific. We're not doing anyone any favors. It's overwhelmingly in our interest. Overwhelmingly. It's overwhelmingly in our interest that Australia continue to grow, succeed, and prosper.\nWe've worked closely with our democratic partners throughout the Pacific to strengthen our historic alliances, to intensify our cooperation with not only Australia, but with Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines.\nWe've upgraded our capacity to address the challenges of our more complex security environment, and we've done it together -- counterterrorism, cyber security, nuclear proliferation.\nAnd today, our partnership with our allies and other security partners in the Pacific are stronger than they have ever been, especially here in Australia, where our military interoperability and our intelligence cooperation -- being part of the Five Eyes -- are at an all-time high. We share everything. We have made unprecedented investments to strengthen our partnerships in Southeast Asia -- joining the East Asia Summit, the region's premier leaders-level forum for political and strategic issues; supporting a democratic transition in Burma; rebuilding our relationship with Vietnam.\nAnd, since 2010 we've invested $4 billion in development assistance in ASEAN countries alone.\nAcross the region, we've worked with our partners to write high-standard trade agreements and to protect the rights of workers, preserve the environment, uphold intellectual property rights -- the kinds of agreements that support broad-based economic growth and keep the engines of our global economy running.\nWe've made important progress to center our growing relationship with China in enhanced cooperation and responsible competition. There is no doubt that the United States of America\nis a Pacific nation. I've spent a great deal of time with President Xi, a lot of time. I've traveled with him five days in China. I've probably spent more time with him alone than any world leader. And when he asked me why we were so engaged, I pointed out, we are a Pacific nation. That's who we are. And will maintain that posture as long as we exist.\nI made that point, I've said President Xi directly what I said to president -- with Prime Minister Turnbull yesterday: Our resolve to play a part in shaping the future of this dynamic region is real. As the President said, we are all in. We are not going anywhere.\nAnd that's vital, because our presence in the region -- and it sounds terrible to say coming from the lips of an American elected official -- our presence in the region is essential to maintaining peace and stability, without which the economic growth and prosperity I believe would falter. America is the lynchpin. And we want to ensure the sea lanes are secure and the skies remain open.\nThat's how to maintain the free flow of commerce that is the lifeblood of this region. And that's the only way our nations will be able to grow and succeed together. And if we get this right, which we can -- as my grandfather would say, with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors.\nWe have an incredible opportunity to shape the future of our world in ways that will make it better for billions of people.\nAnd, by the way, the reason we're able to make these commitments, is because the United States of America has the strongest economy in the world. I read your editorials. I read editorials around the world. The question was who we are, do we have the staying power? Do we have the economic capacity? This is not being arrogant, it's just a fact.\nOver the past seven-and-a-half years, President Obama and I have led the country from economic crisis to recovery to resurgence. We made some very tough choices, and they've paid off. Since the Great Recession, our economy has grown 20 times faster than Europe's and 100 times faster than Japan. We have created more jobs than every other industrialized nation in the world combined.\nI say that not to brag, but to reassure. The United States is going to remain the strongest economy in the world. Because we have solid foundations -- like you do. Our economy is destined to drive sustained growth. We have vast energy resources. The epicenter of energy for the 21st century is North America -- is North America. It's not the Arabian Peninsula or Nigeria or Venezuela. And we want them to do well. But we have resources like you even greater of human capital.\nOur workers are among the most productive in the world. We have the best research universities in the world. And we foster a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation and risk-taking that is unrivaled anywhere in the world. As I said yesterday, a young man when Steve Jobs was speaking at Stanford University said, Mr. Jobs, what do I have to do to be more like you? He said, think different.\nThink different. You can only think different where you can breathe free air. You can only think different where you don't worship at the shrine of orthodoxy. That's the similarity we both have.\nSo if I had to bet on which country is going to lead economically in the 21st century, you might expect me, I'd bet on the United States. But I'd put it another way: It's never been a good bet to bet against the United States. It's never been a good bet to bet against the United States.\nThe partnership between Australia and America is at the core of our vision for the region's future. It's not what we can do for Australia. It's what we can do with Australia. Ours is a partnership of possibilities built on inherent potential that pulses through the veins our people.\nWe are nations of explorers and dreamers who have never backed down from a challenge. Never ever have your people ever backed down from a challenge, nor have ours. We believe barriers were meant to be broken and frontiers to be furthered.\nYour great novelist Patrick White wrote: \"The map? I will first make it.\"\nThe map? I will first make it. That's what you all are made of. And it's that kinship of spirit that shared refusal to be bound by orthodoxy, a belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things if given an opportunity. It's the nature of our immigrant past and present. I think it's what makes the United States and Australia natural partners as we take on the biggest challenges of our times.\nThis is the hundredth-year anniversary of William Butler Yeats' poem Easter Sunday 1916, and the Rising in Ireland. There's a line in the poem he used to try to describe the changes that were taking place in his Ireland that I think better describe the world we face together today than it did his Ireland. He said: \"All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.\"\nAll has changed in the last 15 years and how we adapt to that change is going to determine the future of both our nations and the future for our children and grandchildren.\nHere in the Pacific, we've seen it borne out that commerce and free markets are the most powerful engines for lifting people out of poverty and growing the middle class -- from China to Australia, from India to the Philippines.\nOn Monday, I visited the Boeing factory in Melbourne where they're making wing flaps for the 787 Dreamliner, truly high-tech, specialized manufacturing. One hundred years ago -- not long after humans mastered the mechanism of flight -- Boeing started building planes. Not long after that, they started doing business here in Australia. It's a powerful example of our enduring economic ties. Today, Melbourne is the home to the largest Boeing factory outside the United States. And together we are quite literally building the future of aviation.\nBut our economic relationship is not just the story of corporate giants. It's the story of scrappy start-ups and unlikely successes, of ideas that take wing because, instead of asking why?, Australians and Americans ask why not? Why can we not do that?\nThat's the story of the Australians I've met this week. I met a young man who transformed his experience as an engineer in the Royal Navy into a business that provides funding and technical assistance to help launch other start-ups, including connecting with them with American investors and collaborators.\nAnd as we seek to expand prosperity and opportunity to more people around the world, we will be more successful with more links crossing the Pacific, links that connect Sydney and Silicon Valley, Brisbane and Brooklyn.\nIn Melbourne, I visited the new Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, where you invested $1 billion -- a $1 billion commitment to provide the best possible care to patients and at the same time to improve access exponentially to treatments.\nI'm very proud that our nations have signed three memorandums of understanding that will increase collaboration between Australia and the United States and accelerate a project very close to my heart, the project the President put me in charge of, our Moonshot Initiative, to end cancer as we know it; to do in five years what otherwise would take 10 to 15 years. Probably every one of you have been touched by cancer -- a family member, yourself, a worker that you work with. And you know every extra day, every extra week, every extra month matters to someone facing a terminal prognosis. Just give me one month to give my daughter way in marriage. Just allow me to stay another six to see my grandchild graduate. Just give me a little more time to finish this business arrangement so my wife or my husband will not be left bereft financially as well as emotionally.\nOur enhanced collaboration is going to make data available\non a clinical phenotype for 60,000 cancer patients, while protecting their privacy.\nAnd that means researchers around the world will better be able to understand what causes a particular cancer, how to target those cancers and develop more effective treatments, and how to keep those cancers from returning. We now have access to Big Data. We can do a million billion calculations per second. Let me say that again. We can do as I speak a million billion calculations per second. And within the next three years, our Department of Energy will be able to do a billion billion calculations per second, opening up a vista that was beyond comprehension even 10 years ago.\nThe research our nations are doing together will quite literally reach the cellular level as we enhance our understanding of how proteogenomics impacts cancer progression and treatment outcomes. That's what you're doing in Melbourne.\nAnd it stretches out billions of miles into our galaxy\nas we unlock the mysteries of our universe. Earlier this month, on July the 4th, NASA successfully slipped the Juno aircraft [sic] into orbit around Jupiter. This complex mission, planned in meticulous detail over the course of many years, was only possible because of a critical investment here in Australia -- in collaboration with your science research agency -- to install two new satellite dishes as part of the Deep Space Network.\nThe Juno mission linked expert engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, with Australian scientists at the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex --with the largest planet in our solar system.\nThis is only the latest example of where Australia and America are charging forward together to the next frontiers as we always have -- with skill, determination, and little bit of luck.\nI don't think any of our leaders could have envisioned how rapidly our technologies, our economies, or our world would change when they signed the ANZUS treaty 65 years ago. But they understood then, as we do now, that our ability to ensure security in this vital region undergirds everything our nations hope to accomplish.\nWithout secure sea lanes and open skies, commerce cannot thrive. Without peace and stability between our nations, among our nations, cooperation can't flourish. Without basic human security, girls and boys across the region will never have the chance to achieve their full potential.\nOver the past few days, I've met with Prime Minister Turnbull, Foreign Minister Bishop, and Labor Party Leader Shorten. We discussed a full range of issues on which\nAustralia and the United States stand together.\nAnd because of the concerted effort that our two governments have made to prioritize this partnership -- across leaders and political parties -- our alliance is stronger than ever. Built with the foundations laid by the three Prime Ministers sitting in front of me. And it is an alliance that's equipped for the future.\nOn my way here, I flew to the USS John C Stennis aircraft carrier. And I sat in the Admiral's chair on the flag bridge and observed the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise. It's the largest, international maritime military exercise in the world, and the world has ever seen, covering scenarios from missile threats, to piracy, from search and rescue, to disaster responses. The full range of challenges together we face in the 21st century.\nIt exists because 25 years ago, under your administration, Prime Minister, the United States and Canada and Australia understood the importance of meeting the threats to the stability in the Pacific as a united, interoperable front. From that core idea, the exercise has grown to include 27 participating nations -- truly spanning the entire rim of the Pacific -- more than 25,000 military personnel, with Australia continuing to play an anchoring role.\nAnd our cooperation goes far beyond RIMPAC. In fact, when I met with the head of U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, Admiral Harry Harris, the first person he wanted me to meet with in private -- and the first person he wanted me to meet with was Major General Greg Bilton a two-star general in the Australian Army who is embedded in our chain of command. As in, he commands American troops. He has direct command over American troops. It will not surprise you we don't let that happen very often. (Laughter.) But it's because of the competence, capability, and the faith we have in the Australian military.\nAnd yesterday, here in Australia, I met with Australian troops on the HMAS Adelaide right out here in Sydney Harbor. I not only spoke to the crew and the commanders, but on board were roughly 30 Australian military troops that had just or not long ago returned from fighting alongside American forces in Iraq and in Syria.\nThese men and women are not only the pride of our nations, they're the heart of our enduring commitment to ensure there is\nno daylight between our fighting forces. Whether we are taking the fight to al-Qaeda, ISIL, or Daesh, as they say in the Arab countries, or all those and any people who threaten our safety, the safety of our peoples. Whether we are standing together to maintain peace and stability in Asia, or whether we are working side-by-side to provide humanitarian assistance in the Pacific Islands, Australia and the United States have each others' backs.\nAnd I said earlier that two of my uncles fought with Aussies in the region, in New Guinea. And every time my grandfather Finnegan, the name of Australia would come up, my grandfather who was elderly by this time and lost his son, would literally straighten. You could see him, his body language. He would straighten his shoulders. And three generations later, my son, a major in the United States Army, highly decorated who I just lost, when he talked about who Americans wanted to have their back in 2008, 2009 when he was there, he talked about the Aussies. I thought that was pretty -- on a personal basis a continuum from 1943 to 2012.\nOurs is a partnership that reminds us of what is best in ourselves, even as we acknowledges that as nations, we have not always lived up to our best values. Both our nations have characters strengthened by generations of courageous immigrants\nwho arrived from somewhere else. But their spirit and energy sustains and has sustained us and renewed us as nations since our founding. Both our nations -- America and Australia alike -- continue to grapple with the freighted legacies of racism and exclusion that shaped some of our past, but which still leave behind too many of our citizens. But we've always overcome. We grapple. We strive. We speak out, and we seek change.\nAnd because of the commitment of our citizens to our most fundamental values -- because of you -- we move inexorably forward. So don't worry about our election. (Laughter.) Don't worry about our election. The better angels in America will prevail.\nSo at a time like this, when the forces of xenophobia, nationalism and demagoguery are once again being trumpeted around the world, including in my country, when reactionary politicians seek to erode those values our nations hold most dear -- tolerance, equality, opportunity for all -- we have to remember who we are as Australians and as Americans, and reflect our best selves back to the world.\nWe are people who insist with passion and conviction that basic human dignity cannot be denied to any man, or woman, or child on this Earth. That's the core of who we are. We never bend. We never bow.\nThat's why, like the United States, Australia is leading a major effort to end the terrible scourge of violence against women. Even at the footy match I attended on Sunday, one of the teams was making respect and family violence prevention a central commitment of their club. It's a cause that I've been leading in the United States for decades. Sadly, we still have a lot more work to do to change the culture in both our nations. But we can and we will.\nMy father used to have an expression -- and I think he would have the same expression where he an Aussie -- I really mean this. He said, the worst sin a man or woman can commit is the abuse of power -- whether it's political, economic, or physical. And he'd say the cardinal sin of all sins was a man raising his hand to a woman or a child.\nIn both Australia and the United States, if you look at our history, our neighborhoods, the abuse of power is viewed with abhorrence by our people. Equality really is the watchword. And though we sometimes stumble, we keep taking steps to extend true equality to more and more people.\nI'm extremely proud of the work our administration has done to advance the rights of the LGBT community in the United States, to celebrate the lives and loves of all Americans.\nAnd recently in Australia, both Victoria and New South Wales issued historic apologies for the past mistreatment of LGBT individuals under the law. It's a powerful gesture that sets the stage to move forward, so that institutionalized discrimination and mistreatment of the community can never happen again.\nAnd both our nations continue to look for ways to expand opportunity and inclusion when it comes to the original inhabitants of our lands -- Native Americans, Indian Nations in America, the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people\nof this great continent.\nSo we not only share the same values, we understand that talk is cheap. In our Constitution we use the phrase \"in order to form a more perfect union\" -- we mean it. We have a long way to go. But it's in order to form a \"more perfect union\". We've been willing to stand up for our values, make the changes we wish to see in the world a reality.\nOn this trip, I brought along three of my granddaughters. The two older ones are fully informed. They're 18 and 22. One recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, about to go to graduate school in international relations. The other will be a senior. But I also brought along my deceased son Beau's 12-year-old daughter. Because I wanted her and them to see firsthand the energy and the spirit of this incredible country. And that's not hyperbole. I'm being literal.\nI want them to understand who the Australian people are, and why the partnership between our two proud nations is so strong. When I think about the future we are creating, when I imagine the maps we are first making, I think of them -- like I suspect you do, as well.\nLike so many of the young people in this audience today, they're incredibly bright and curious about our world, a world no longer circumscribed by borders and distance. And it is my hope for them, for young people everywhere is that they never experience any limitations whatsoever on their dreams. They're taught to never, never, never, never, never, never give up. No matter how life intervenes.\nThat's the future we're working together to bring about. And I leave Australia more optimistic than ever about the enormous potential that exists in our world, so much of it right here in the Asia Pacific, to take the arc of history in our hands\nAnd just bend it, just a little bit, just a little bit. Great change only occurs if there's inflection points. And we're at one of those points right now. I absolutely firmly believe we can bend it to a brighter tomorrow.\nAs my grandfather would say, I didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday. I've been around a long time. Our partnership encompasses all the infinite talents of our people, our drive to achieve and innovate, our commitment to uphold justice and equality, our innate animated conviction that every human being in the planet deserves a fair go.\nIt's a partnership of possibilities, a partnership about the future, a partnership about progress. That's what brings us together. And that's what I've seen every stop along this trip and what I've experienced in my 44-year career. And that's why I know that the great friendship between our two nations will not diminish. It will grow stronger with every generation.\nI thank you for your indulgence in listening to me, and I'll end by saying may God protect our troops because we stand together. Thank you, thank you, thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-07-20", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on the Future of the U.S.-Australian Relationship in Asia in Sydney, Australia"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 3:35 p.m. in Atrium Hall at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.

Thank you! Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you so much. Well, thank you, Strive, for those kind words and your great work to promote opportunity in Africa and across the globe. I should point out, by the way, Strive just told me he was in the middle of a board meeting, he flew here, he's got to go back. He hasn't gotten any sleep. That's how committed he is to the work that we're doing. So give Strive a big round of applause.\nSo this is quite a group. [Laughter] Just a lot of do-gooders in one room. [Laughter] That's good. Just own it. [Laughter] You should be proud of it. I want to welcome our partners from around the world. We've got leaders from government, from the private sector, civil society, faith communities who are doing great work, and so many inspiring young people. And I want to thank our partners in Congress from both sides of the aisle who prove that every once in a while, in a city that doesn't agree on much—[laughter]—we can all agree on the imperative of smart development. So thank you. Thank you.\nObviously, this has been a tough couple of weeks, not just here in the United States, but around the world. And that's being amplified to some degree during political season. So I think maybe it's worth stepping back for a moment. This is a challenging time, with threats of terrorism, an international order that is buffeted by all kinds of different events, a sense that globalization is leaving too many people behind, and expanding inequality within countries, even if we are seeing progress in the aggregate.\nAnd all of this creates legitimate fears and anxieties that have to be addressed and, at least a feeling, a perception that people don't have full control over a rapidly changing world. So it is worth reminding ourselves of how lucky we are to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progressive era in human history.\nNow, that's hard to absorb if we're watching the newscasts every night, because there's heartbreak and terrible things taking place at any given moment across the globe. But it's important for us to remember, not so that we become complacent, but so that we understand that good works can make a difference. Think about it. It has been decades since a war between major powers. More people live in democracies. More people are linked by technology. Thanks in part to the dedication and passion and hard work of so many of the people who are gathered here today, in recent decades, the world has achieved incredible advances in development and human dignity.\nWe've saved over 60 million lives from measles and malaria and tuberculosis. We've slashed HIV/AIDS infections and deaths. Across the developing world, incomes have gone up. Tens of millions of boys and girls are in school. Millions have gained access to clean energy, helping to mitigate the threat of climate change. In just the past 25 years, more than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty—1 billion. Michael Elliott, the former head of the ONE Campaign, who we remember today—he liked to say that we're living through an \"age of miracles.\" And he's right.\nAnd sometimes, when I'm talking to young interns at the White House who are still immunizing themselves from the cynicism that's so chronic in this town—[laughter]—I remind them, if you had to choose a moment in history to be born and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be, you'd choose now. [Laughter] Because the world has never been less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant, with more opportunity for more people, and more connected than it is today.\nAnd all of you can take great pride in these historic achievements. It's a testament to what's possible when we work together: governments, multilateral institutions, the private sector, and civil society. And it is a testament to our shared commitment to the dignity of every human being. This is something I was nursed on. Some of you know my mother worked with USAID and the Ford Foundation, traveling places like Indonesia and Pakistan, working to help lift up the rural poor, particularly women. It's something that I tried to apply myself as a young grassroots organizer on the South Side of Chicago, working with people who wanted to expand hopes and opportunity and jobs in forgotten neighborhoods.\nI've seen the possibilities of progress, and so have all of you. And yet we are humbled by the work that remains. When some 800 million men, women, and children subsist on less than $1.25 a day, when 11 boys and girls are dying every minute from mostly preventable causes, when hundreds of women are dying every day from having a baby—when all this is happening right before our eyes, we know we've got a lot of work to do.\nAnd so today we reaffirm our belief that in the 21st century, no child should go to bed hungry and no child should die from a mosquito bite and no one should be denied opportunity because of where they're born or what gender or religion they are or the color of their skin or who they love. All of us are born equal, and we're all connected. And if a schoolhouse door is closed to a young girl, then we're all diminished. And when a mother can't buy medicine for her sick child, or a family flees violence, whether in Syria or El Salvador, in a sense, that makes us all poorer and all less secure. That's what we believe; that's what brings us here together.\nAnd just as our values compel us to act, so do pragmatism, so does self-interest. When there are no roads to take goods to market, and when corruption steals from an entrepreneur or siphons off billions that could be going to schools and hospitals and infrastructure, that keeps too many people in too many countries from joining our global economy.\nAnd there's a reason why Susan Rice, my National Security Adviser, is with us here today. There's a reason why our USAID Administrator, Gayle Smith—she of the spectacular hair—sits—[laughter]—there's a reason that Gayle sits alongside generals in the Situation Room when we're talking about critical national security issues. Because we know there is a correlation between no education, no jobs, no hope, the violation of basic human dignity, and conflict and instability. So development isn't charity. It's one of the smartest investments we can make in our shared future: in our security and our prosperity.\nAnd sometimes, that's a tough argument to make here in the United States, where we have big needs and there are kids going hungry in this country and don't have good enough schools in this country and have insufficient shelter in this country. Sometimes, people feel like, well, why are we making investments anyplace else? And yet we don't question hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in our military. And I could not be prouder as Commander in Chief to have the world's best military and the best military in human history, and it's needed. And sometimes, we have to make sure that we're addressing those who would do us harm.\nBut for us to make a fraction of that investment in schools and clean water and health care—that's why we do it. It's not because we're not mindful of the needs here in this country; it's because if we make those investments, we're also going to be in a better position to protect our country and improve our country. And this is why, as President, I've elevated development as a key pillar of American foreign policy. With the help of many of you, we've established our new global development policy, and we've transformed the way we do business.\nWe changed how we measure development, not just by the dollars we invest—although, we still invest a lot of dollars—but by whether people and nations are actually better off as a consequence of those investments. Instead of government going it alone, we've deepened partnerships with multilateral organizations and civil society and the private sector and faith communities and, most importantly, people on the ground. Instead of just sending foreign aid, we're leveraging new sources of funding, committing and mobilizing more than $100 billion from the private sector and other partners to promote development and save lives.\nAnd in the fight against poverty, we're treating governments as partners, not charity cases. Instead of top-down approaches, we're building local capacity, because local partners have to be in the lead.\nSo the United States continues to be the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid—and it will remain so as long as I'm President, and—[laughter]. And it will remain so, I'm confident, in the next administration. But instead of just responding after crises happen, what we've been focused on is helping communities and countries build resilience to shocks and to be in a position to avoid crises, because we have to be hardheaded and big hearted at the same time. And in doing so, we've ushered in a new era of accountability and results. For donor nations like the United States and for all of us who believe passionately in development, we've got to make every penny count. So we're holding our partners in developing nations to the same standard, no excuses. Waste, fraud, corruption—those are anathema to development.\nAnd today we're here to celebrate the progress that we've made. We're here to keep the momentum going, guided by the new sustainable development goals, including our goal to end the outrage of extreme poverty.\nSo I may only have 6 months left in office, but I'm here to say that whoever the next President is, development has to remain a fundamental pillar of American foreign policy and a key part of our work to lift up lives, not just overseas, but here in the United States. If you care about human dignity, if you care about reducing violence and terrorism, if you care about fighting climate change, if you care about addressing inequality and creating trade and prosperity that works for all and not just some, then you're going to have to pay attention to development, and you're going to have to make an investment.\nSo that's what all of you have been doing. [Laughter] And I'm here to tell you, let's keep going. Let's keep unleashing broad-based growth that transforms economies and lifts people and nations from poverty and [to; White House correction.] prosperity. People tell me around the world when I travel, developing nations, they do not just want aid, they want trade. They want capacity building. As we've seen from South Korea to Chile to Botswana, the developing nation of today can end up being the engine of global growth tomorrow.\nSo having renewed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, moving ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we can make sure that trade and globalization delivers progress, not just for those at the top, but also for the many. We'll continue to partner with countries that embrace reforms and attract investment. And in November—in September, in New York, we're going to host the second U.S.-Africa Business Forum to keep promoting growth and innovation and investment across the continent.\nWorking with over 40 countries, we're bringing the wonders of technology to far corners of the globe, accelerating access to the Internet, bridging the digital divide. We've mobilized governments and multilateral institutions and more than 100 private sector partners around our Power Africa initiative, funding everything from big power plants to off-the-grid and small, renewable energy projects. And we are proving that countries don't have to choose between expanding access to power and combating climate change. These projects are expected to generate up to 29,000 megawatts of cleaner electricity so that students can study at night and businesses can stay open and farmers can use mechanized tools. And I believe that by 2030, we can bring electricity to over 60 million African homes and businesses. And that will be transformative for the entire continent.\nAnd because economies can't thrive without rule of law, together let's keep fighting for good governance and strong, accountable institutions. That's the bedrock of sustainable development. You wouldn't know it sometimes, because in advanced countries sometimes, there's such antigovernment rhetoric. [Laughter] But it turns out, like, having functioning governments are really important. [Laughter]\nSo that's one of the reasons I committed the U.S. Government to more transparency on my very first day in office. And with our Open Government Partnership of 70 countries, representing some 2 billion people, we've continued to empower reformers and civil society, from Sierra Leone to Ukraine to Uruguay. Because governments should serve the people and not the other way around.\nAnd by the way, progress is not in a straight line. It's not overnight. Just as here in the United States we've still got more reforms to make, that's true of a lot of countries that are participating. But we have seen this tool prodding governments in new directions, opening up, creating greater mechanisms of accountability, setting new norms that, over time, make a difference.\nTogether, let's keep strengthening food security and nutrition. No society can flourish—children can't flourish—if they're going hungry. We can't ask a child to feed her mind when she can barely feed her stomach. So with our alliance between government and private sector and NGOs, we need to keep empowering farmers with new seeds and new technologies and new techniques that are scaled appropriately and sustainable. And it works.\nLast year alone, we reached over 9 million farmers across the globe, reducing hunger, boosting yields, increasing incomes by more than $800 million. In many of the areas where we work, poverty has been cut by up to a quarter. Stunting is down by as much as a third. Nearly 18 million more children are getting better nutrition. And right before coming here, in the Oval Office, I signed into law the Global Food Security Act, which is a bipartisan bill. So the—[applause]. I—thank you. Thank you. I—you're not surprised I signed it, right? [Laughter] I mean, I—I mean, you guys are all excited about it. [Laughter] We've been working on this for a while. We got it passed, so it's my job to sign it. [Laughter] But this is a bipartisan bill that authorizes more than $7 billion so that initiatives like Feed the Future endure well into the future. So let's sustain this progress. Let's make hunger history.\nTogether, let's keep advancing global health and keep reforming health systems, empowering local communities, investing in new treatments and prevention. Building on the fine work of my predecessor, President George Bush, we've saved an estimated 6 million lives from malaria since the year 2000. In our fight against HIV/AIDS, we've nearly quadrupled the number of people receiving treatment since 2009. We're supporting 9.5 million people with lifesaving therapies. And I believe we can meet our goal of treating nearly 13 million people by the end of next year.\nOur vision is within reach: the first AIDS-free generation. And with our commitment to infant and maternal health, we've helped save the lives of more than 4.5 million children and 200,000 mothers. Together, we beat back Ebola in West Africa. And with nearly 50 countries united around our Global Health Security Agenda, we're going to keep boosting our ability to prevent and detect and respond to outbreaks. And here, I do have to just add a little editorial. [Laughter] Republicans in Congress can help: Pass that bill that treats Zika like the serious threat that it is. Fully fund our response. That's an example of protecting America and helping other countries too. We can get that done.\nAnd maybe, most of all, together, let's keep empowering our young people whose energy and enthusiasm and optimism can lift up countries, no matter how tough the circumstances. I have met so many young people all over the world that just inspire me. We joke sometimes that with all the grim stuff I have to deal with every day, get me in a room with some young people. [Laughter] The old heads get me depressed sometimes. [Laughter] Because they're ready to go to work. They need support, they need the skills, but we've already brought together nearly half a million young people through our Young Leaders Initiatives, from Africa and Southeast Asia and Europe and the Americas. And we want to keep helping them connect and exchange ideas and expertise and best practices; keep giving them the tools to be the next great entrepreneurs, doctors, scientists; the next civil society leaders, maybe even future Presidents and Prime Ministers.\nAnd as we're empowering young people, we've got to continue lifting up all our people, and that means men and women, boys and girls. I've said this before, I will keep repeating it: One of the best measures of a nation's success is how it treats its women. And earlier this month, we had a—the Obama women—[laughter]—Michelle and Sasha and Malia, they went and traveled with young women in Liberia and Morocco. Dr. Jill Biden is in Africa this week. And all—in all these trips, their message is simple: Let girls learn. Let girls learn so they can help start new ventures and drive economies. Let girls learn so that they can invest in their communities. Let girls learn so they can be safe from violence and abuse. Let girls learn so they can realize their dreams. Because when women have equal futures, families and communities and countries are stronger. When they get an education, that means their children are getting an education. This is a fact.\nAnd we haven't made enough progress on this front. We've got to do more. Now, none of this is going to be easy. One of the messages I've been trying to deliver at commencements and other appearances around the country, as my Presidency comes to a close, is just reminding people, stuff is always hard. In fact, I have a plaque on my desk that says \"hard things are hard.\" [Laughter] This was advice that was given to me by one of my senior advisers when we were in the middle of some big fight. [Laughter] He said, you know, here's the thing, Mr. President, hard things are hard. [Laughter] I said, that is profound. You're right. [Laughter]\nBut sometimes, we get disappointed in this age of instant gratification when we don't feel as if everything is solved. Well, we're here on this Earth just a blink of an eye, each of us. We take the world that's been given to us, and we try to make it just a little bit better, and then somebody else picks it up, and they do their part. And there are people who are trying to impede progress. And—but the good news is, is that the general trajectory of humanity is, is that the folks who have been trying to make progress have outnumbered those who haven't. And over time, things just get a little bit better, and it adds up.\nBut it's hard. And when President Kennedy said we'd go to the Moon, he said we chose to do it because it's hard. There's no point in doing easy stuff. [Laughter] Nearly 50 years ago today, a man first walked on the Moon. That was hard. And JFK once said that \"The conquest of poverty is as difficult, if not more difficult, than the conquest of outer space.\" So we can't get discouraged. We can get frustrated sometimes. We may—at least if you're in the Oval Office—occasionally utter a curse word or two. [Laughter] But——\nAudience member. Four more years! [Laughter]\nThe President. But we've got to stick with it. Because it's going to take years to reach our goals. But whenever the task seems too great, I am reminded—and I'm sure you are too—of all the people that I've met these past 8 years, the odds they've faced that pale in comparison to the challenges that we face, the promise they hold.\nThe young farmer in Senegal, who started with 1 hectare of land, grew that to 16, and boosted her incomes, and brought a tractor and suddenly was a employer and small-businessperson. And just hearing her talk about what had happened to her in a few years as a consequence of some of the work that the people in this room had done, that gives me hope. She gives me hope.\nOr the young entrepreneur in Peru who is teaching rural women digital skills, and suddenly, they're employable, and they've got a whole new set of possibilities in front of them. Or the health care workers in the Bishop Tutu HIV/AIDS clinic in South Africa and the incredible work that they do with good cheer and unbelievable effort. And all the brave men and women with the virus who have overcome despair and are now living full and long lives and are giving something back—they give me hope.\nAnd I think of all the citizens at the grassroots in countries around the world, in places where it's dangerous sometimes, who are pushing to hold governments accountable—lawyers who are monitoring elections and activists in civil society and innovators building platforms to enhance transparency—they give me hope.\nAll of you coming together from across sectors, working together: government, private sector, civil society, faith groups. Because you understand that despite whatever differences of religion or background or race or region, we are united as one human race and by our abiding commitment to the inherent dignity of every human being. All of you give me hope.\nJust as you've had a partner in me and my administration, I'm confident that as we work for the prosperity and justice and peace that all of us seek in the world, as we reach people who may feel forgotten and bring hope to remote corners of this planet, I am absolutely convinced that you'll have a strong partner in the United States of America. We've shown this can work. Now we've just got to keep it up. All right?\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless.", "timestamp": "2016-07-20", "title": "Remarks at the White House Summit on Global Development"}

{"author": "Democratic Party Platforms", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117717", "text": "Preamble\nIn 2016, Democrats meet in Philadelphia with the same basic belief that animated the Continental Congress when they gathered here 240 years ago: Out of many, we are one.\nUnder President Obama's leadership, and thanks to the hard work and determination of the American people, we have come a long way from the Great Recession and the Republican policies that triggered it. American businesses have now added 14.8 million jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010. Twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage. The American auto industry just had its best year ever. And we are getting more of our energy from the sun and wind, and importing less oil from overseas.\nBut too many Americans have been left out and left behind. They are working longer hours with less security. Wages have barely budged and the racial wealth gap remains wide, while the cost of everything from childcare to a college education has continued to rise. And for too many families, the dream of homeownership is out of reach. As working people struggle, the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power. Republicans in Congress have chosen gridlock and dysfunction over trying to find solutions to the real challenges we face. It's no wonder that so many feel like the system is rigged against them.\nDemocrats believe that cooperation is better than conflict, unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls.\nIt's a simple but powerful idea: we are stronger together.\nDemocrats believe we are stronger when we have an economy that works for everyone—an economy that grows incomes for working people, creates good-paying jobs, and puts a middle-class life within reach for more Americans. Democrats believe we can spur more sustainable economic growth, which will create good-paying jobs and raise wages. And we can have more economic fairness, so the rewards are shared broadly, not just with those at the top. We need an economy that prioritizes long-term investment over short-term profit-seeking, rewards the common interest over self-interest, and promotes innovation and entrepreneurship.\nWe believe that today's extreme level of income and wealth inequality—where the majority of the economic gains go to the top one percent and the richest 20 people in our country own more wealth than the bottom 150 million—makes our economy weaker, our communities poorer, and our politics poisonous.\nAnd we know that our nation's long struggle with race is far from over. More than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, more than half a century after César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Larry Itliong organized, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. We must face that reality and we must fix it.\nWe believe a good education is a basic right of all Americans, no matter what zip code they live in. We will end the school-to-prison pipeline and build a cradle-to-college pipeline instead, where every child can live up to his or her God-given potential.\nWe believe in helping Americans balance work and family without fear of punishment or penalty. We believe in at last guaranteeing equal pay for women. And as the party that created Social Security, we believe in protecting every American's right to retire with dignity.\nWe firmly believe that the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street must be brought to an end. Wall Street must never again be allowed to threaten families and businesses on Main Street.\nDemocrats believe we are stronger when we protect citizens' right to vote, while stopping corporations' outsized influence in elections. We will fight to end the broken campaign finance system, overturn the disastrous Citizens United decision, restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act, and return control of our elections to the American people.\nDemocrats believe that climate change poses a real and urgent threat to our economy, our national security, and our children's health and futures, and that Americans deserve the jobs and security that come from becoming the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\nDemocrats believe we are stronger and safer when America brings the world together and leads with principle and purpose. We believe we should strengthen our alliances, not weaken them. We believe in the power of development and diplomacy. We believe our military should be the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, and that we must do everything we can to honor and support our veterans. And we know that only the United States can mobilize common action on a truly global scale, to take on the challenges that transcend borders, from international terrorism to climate change to health pandemics.\nAbove all, Democrats are the party of inclusion. We know that diversity is not our problem—it is our promise. As Democrats, we respect differences of perspective and belief, and pledge to work together to move this country forward, even when we disagree. With this platform, we do not merely seek common ground—we strive to reach higher ground.\nWe are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We know that today's immigrants are tomorrow's teachers, doctors, lawyers, government leaders, soldiers, entrepreneurs, activists, PTA members, and pillars of our communities.\nWe believe in protecting civil liberties and guaranteeing civil rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities. We believe America is still, as Robert Kennedy said, \"a great country, an unselfish country, and a compassionate country.\"\nThese principles stand in sharp contrast to the Republicans, who have nominated as the standard-bearer for their party and their candidate for President a man who seeks to appeal to Americans' basest differences, rather than our better natures.\nThe stakes have been high in previous elections. But in 2016, the stakes can be measured in human lives—in the number of immigrants who would be torn from their homes; in the number of faithful and peaceful Muslims who would be barred from even visiting our shores; in the number of allies alienated and dictators courted; in the number of Americans who would lose access to health care and see their rights ripped away.\nThis election is about more than Democrats and Republicans. It is about who we are as a nation, and who we will be in the future.\nTwo hundred and forty years ago, in Philadelphia, we started a revolution of ideas and of action that continues to this day. Since then, our union has been tested many times, through bondage and civil war, segregation and depression, two world wars and the threat of nuclear annihilation. Generations of Americans fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of opportunity and dignity—and we are fighting still.\nDespite what some say, America is and has always been great—but not because it has been perfect. What makes America great is our unerring belief that we can make it better. We can and we will build a more just economy, a more equal society, and a more perfect union—because we are stronger together.\nRaise Incomes and Restore Economic Security for the Middle Class\nDemocrats believe we must break down all the barriers holding Americans back and restore the basic bargain that built America's mighty middle class: If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead and stay ahead. The system is not working when we have a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages, while most new income and wealth goes to the top one percent. Republican governors, legislatures, and their corporate allies have launched attack after attack on workers' fundamental rights to organize and bargain collectively. Too many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and hallmarks of a middle class life—owning a home, having access to affordable and quality childcare, retiring with dignity—feel out of reach. It is no wonder so many Americans feel like the deck is stacked against them. The Democratic Party believes that supporting workers through higher wages, workplace protections, policies to balance work and family, and other investments will help rebuild the middle class for the 21st century.\nRaising Workers' Wages\nDemocrats believe that the current minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage. No one who works full time should have to raise a family in poverty. We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the right to form or join a union and will work in every way we can—in Congress and the federal government, in states and with the private sector—to reach this goal. We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it, give all Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy so every worker can earn at least $15 an hour. We applaud the approaches taken by states like New York and California. We also support creating one fair wage for all workers by ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and people with disabilities.\nDemocrats support a model employer executive order or some other vehicle to leverage federal dollars to support employers who provide their workers with a living wage, good benefits, and the opportunity to form a union without reprisal. The one trillion dollars spent annually by the government on contracts, loans, and grants should be used to support good jobs that rebuild the middle class.\nProtecting Workers' Fundamental Rights\nThe Democratic Party believes that when workers are strong, America is strong. Democrats will make it easier for workers, public and private, to exercise their right to organize and join unions. We will fight to pass laws that direct the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards, as well as laws that bring companies to the negotiating table. We support binding arbitration to help workers who have voted to join a union reach a first contract.\nA major factor in the 40-year decline in the middle class is that the rights of workers to bargain collectively for better wages and benefits have been under attack at all levels. Donald Trump would make matters worse by creating a race to the bottom where the middle class is fighting over fewer and fewer good-paying jobs. In fact, Trump rejected some attempts by his own employees to unionize and has personally hired union-busting firms to undermine workers' rights.\nDemocrats believe so-called \"right to work\" laws are wrong for workers—such as teachers and other public employees who serve our communities every day—and wrong for America. We will continue to vigorously oppose those laws and other efforts that would eliminate dues check-off procedures, roll-back prevailing wage standards, abolish fair share requirements, restrict the use of voluntary membership payments for political purposes, attack seniority, restrict due process protections, and require annual recertification efforts. We oppose legislation and lawsuits that would strike down laws protecting the rights of teachers and other public employees. We will defend President Obama's overtime rule, which protects of millions of workers by paying them fairly for their hard work.\nThe Democratic Party believes consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors who have been mistreated should never be denied their right to fight for fair treatment under the law. That is why we will support efforts to limit the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service contracts, which unfairly strip consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors of their right to their day in court.\nSupporting Working Families\nWe will fight to secure equal pay for women, which will benefit all women and their families, particularly women of color who are disproportionately impacted by discriminatory pay practices, and against other factors that contribute to the wage gap. And we will combat the discrimination they face on and off the job. While Donald Trump thinks it is \"dangerous\" for women to leave the home and paid family leave hurts our economy, Democrats will make sure that the United States finally enacts national paid family and medical leave by passing a family and medical leave act that would provide all workers at least 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or address a personal or family member's serious health issue. We will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days of paid sick leave. We will also encourage employers to provide paid vacation.\nOur work and family policies must also help family caregivers. We will ensure that family caregivers have the support, respite care, and training they need to support their loved ones. We will create a strong stable paid caregiving workforce to help meet families' needs, by raising wages, improving access to training, and giving workers the opportunity to come together to make their voices heard in support of a stronger system. We will address the conditions that make it hard for workers with unpredictable or inflexible schedules to meet caregiving responsibilities. We will take steps to expand and strengthen the home care workforce. We will increase investments to make quality childcare more affordable, boost wages for childcare workers, and support the millions of people paying for, coordinating, or providing care for aging relatives or those with disabilities.\nHelping More Workers Share in Near-Record Corporate Profits\nCorporate profits are at near-record highs, but workers have not shared through rising wages. Profit-sharing is linked to higher pay and productivity. That is why, working with business, labor, and other stakeholders, we will incentivize companies to share profits with their employees on top of wages and pay increases, while targeting the workers and businesses that need profit-sharing the most.\nExpanding Access to Affordable Housing and Homeownership\nWhereas the Republican Presidential nominee rooted for the housing crisis, Democrats will continue to fight for those families who suffered the loss of their homes. We will help those who are working toward a path of financial stability and will put sustainable home ownership into the reach of more families. Democrats will also combat the affordable housing crisis and skyrocketing rents in many parts of the country, which is leading too many families and workers to be pushed out of communities where they work.\nWe will preserve and increase the supply of affordable rental housing by expanding incentives to ease local barriers to building new affordable rental housing developments in areas of economic opportunity. We will substantially increase funding for the National Housing Trust Fund to construct, preserve, and rehabilitate millions of affordable housing rental units. Not only will this help address the affordable housing crisis, it will also create millions of good-paying jobs in the process. Democrats believe that we should provide more federal resources to the people struggling most with unaffordable housing: low-income families, people with disabilities, veterans, and the elderly.\nWe will expand efforts to address the lingering effects of the foreclosure crisis through programs like the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program. We will also expand programs to prevent displacement of existing residents, especially in communities of color; create affordable and workforce housing; and preserve neighborhood-serving nonprofit organizations and small businesses. We will reinvigorate housing production programs, repair public housing, and increase funding for the housing choice voucher program and other rental assistance programs. And we will fight for robust funding to end homelessness in our cities and counties once and for all, through targeted investments to provide the necessary outreach, social services, and housing options for all populations experiencing homelessness. We will engage in a stronger, more coordinated, and better funded partnership among federal, state, and local governments to end chronic homelessness for millions of Americans. We will build on and expand President Obama's promising initiatives to end veteran and family homelessness in our country.\nWe must make sure that everyone has a fair shot at homeownership. We will keep the housing market robust and inclusive by supporting more first-time homebuyers and putting more Americans into the financial position to become sustainable homeowners; preserving the 30-year fixed rate mortgage; modernizing credit scoring; clarifying lending rules; expanding access to housing counseling; defending and strengthening the Fair Housing Act; and ensuring that regulators have the clear direction, resources, and authority to enforce those rules effectively. We will prevent predatory lending by defending the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). These steps are especially important because over the next decade most new households will be formed by families in communities of color, which typically have less generational wealth and fewer resources to put towards a down payment.\nProtecting and Expanding Social Security\nDemocrats are proud to be the party that created Social Security, one of the nation's most successful and effective programs. Without Social Security, nearly half of America's seniors would be living in poverty. Social Security is more than just a retirement program. It also provides important life insurance to young survivors of deceased workers and provides disability insurance protection. We will fight every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reducing earned benefits. Democrats will expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity and respect, including women who are widowed or took time out of the workforce to care for their children, aging parents, or ailing family members. The Democratic Party recognizes that the way Social Security cost-of- living adjustments are calculated may not always reflect the spending patterns of seniors, particularly the disproportionate amount they spend on health care expenses. We are committed to exploring alternatives that could better and more equitably serve seniors.\nWe will make sure Social Security's guaranteed benefits continue for generations to come by asking those at the top to pay more, and will achieve this goal by taxing some of the income of people above $250,000. The Democratic Party is also committed to providing all necessary financial support for the Social Security Administration so that it can provide timely benefits and high-quality service for those it serves. Our plan contrasts starkly with Donald Trump. He has referred to Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme\" and has called for privatizing it as well as increasing the retirement age.\nEnsuring a Secure and Dignified Retirement\nDemocrats believe it should be easier for Americans to save for retirement and prepare for unforeseen risks and expenses. We will defend the right of workers to collect their defined benefit pensions and make sure workers get priority and protection when pension plans are in distress. Democrats will also fight to enact legislation to make sure that the earned pension benefits of Americans will not be cut, and will pay for it by closing tax loopholes that benefit millionaires and billionaires. We will fight against any attempt by Republicans in Congress or on Wall Street to roll back the Conflict of Interest Rule, which requires that retirement advisors put the best interests of their clients above their own financial gain.\nSeniors should not have to choose between putting food on the table, keeping a roof over their heads, or buying the medication that they need to stay healthy. We strongly support the Older Americans Act, which funds critical programs to help seniors remain independent in their own homes and communities. We are also committed to fighting the immense problem of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\nRevitalizing Our Nation's Postal Service\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) is a national treasure. That is why Democrats embrace a vibrant, public Postal Service that offers universal service, and reject any effort to privatize or marginalize it. We are committed to eliminating the unsustainable mandate to \"pre-fund\" retiree health costs. And we will work to restore service to appropriate levels, including overnight delivery of first-class mail and periodicals within the same metropolitan area, maintaining six-day and door-to-door delivery, and appointing members to the Board of Governors and the Postal Regulatory Commission who champion a strong public Postal Service. Democrats also advocate for expanding postal services. This includes offering basic financial services such as paycheck cashing and removing statutory restraints on services the USPS may offer. It also includes promoting vote-by-mail to increase voter participation and to help address the scourge of voter suppression.\nCreate Good-Paying Jobs\nDemocrats know that nothing is more important than creating good-paying jobs that can support a middle-class life—from nurses, firefighters, and teachers to construction workers, factory workers, and small business owners. That is why we are committed to doing everything we can to build a full-employment economy, where everyone has a job that pays enough to raise a family and live in dignity with a sense of purpose. Democrats will build strong, sustained, shared economic growth. We know that when Americans come together, we can do amazing things. In the last century, our leaders came together across the aisle to electrify the nation, build the Interstate Highway System, support groundbreaking research in medicine, science, and communications, and send a man to the moon. When we are bold and ambitious, we can do big things and make our economy stronger for decades to come.\nBuilding 21st Century Infrastructure\nIf we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class, we need major federal investments to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put millions of Americans back to work in decent paying jobs in both the public and private sectors. The climate emergency and the need to expand the middle class demand that we make the most ambitious investment in American infrastructure since President Eisenhower created the interstate highway system. We will put Americans to work updating and expanding our roads, bridges, public transit, airports, and passenger and freight rail lines. We will build 21st century energy and water systems, modernize our schools, and continue to support the expansion of high-speed broadband networks. We will protect communities from the impact of climate change and help them to mitigate its effects by investing in green and resilient infrastructure. We will address the backlog of deferred maintenance in our four key public land management agencies. And we will protect public health and safety by modernizing drinking and wastewater systems. These investments will create secure, good-paying middle-class jobs today and will substantially increase demand for American-made steel and other products manufactured in the United States. And by boosting economic growth in a fair and equitable way, and strengthening our long-term competitiveness, these investments will create many more jobs in the years to come.\nDemocrats will also create an independent, national infrastructure bank that will support critical infrastructure improvements. This bank will provide loans and other financial assistance for investments in energy, water, broadband, transportation, and multi-modal infrastructure projects. Democrats will continue to support the interest tax exemption on municipal bonds and will work to establish a permanent version of Build America Bonds as an additional tool to encourage infrastructure investment by state and local governments.\nFurthermore, Democrats will fight to ensure resources and programs are adequately targeted to provide economic development, job training, and critical infrastructure investment in areas of the greatest need.\nFostering a Manufacturing Renaissance\nDemocrats believe one of the best ways to innovate, prosper, and create good-paying jobs is to make more in America, which is why we firmly support American manufacturing with a \"Make it in America\" plan. We must revitalize hard-hit manufacturing communities; create thriving hubs of manufacturing and innovation throughout the country; and claw back tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, using the proceeds to reinvest in communities and workers at home instead. Democrats are proud of rescuing the auto industry from collapse, which saved more than a million jobs, and led the auto industry, which is at the heart of American manufacturing, to record sales. Democrats will defend the Export-Import Bank, which supports good-paying jobs across the country and allows American workers and manufacturers to compete on a level playing field. Donald Trump may talk tough, but he has consistently outsourced his own products. American workers deserve better.\nCreating Good-Paying Clean Energy Jobs\nWe must help American workers and businesses compete for jobs and investments in global clean energy, high-tech products, internet technology products, and advanced manufacturing and vehicles. We must make American manufacturing more internationally competitive by making it the greenest and most efficient in the world, including by investing in industrial energy efficiency.\nPursuing Our Innovation Agenda: Science, Research, Education, and Technology\nDemocrats support ambitious public and private investments in science, technology, and research. We are focused on creating good jobs in communities across America. Entrepreneurship and innovation are fundamental to our future economic growth—in the information technology (IT) industry as well as energy, manufacturing, transportation, health, retail, services, and countless other sectors. We will nurture the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, especially women and people of color, to make sure America continues to out-compete and out-innovate the rest of the world with our bold innovation agenda.\nNew technologies are already transforming our economy, and they have the power to generate trillions in economic output. We must harness these forces so that they create higher-paying jobs across the country, bring more people into the workforce, and reduce inequality. To do this, we need to educate our people and train our workforce; support entrepreneurship and promote inclusion in the digital economy; attract and retain talented people from all over the world; and invest in research and development, innovation hubs, as well as in getting ideas to market. We also need to ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn computer science by the time they graduate from high school.\nDemocrats believe we must harness the promise of technological innovation to promote community participation and enhance opportunities to achieve greater economic self-sufficiency for people with disabilities. We will encourage technology transfer, entrepreneurship, and small business creation throughout the country and in all types of innovation sectors.\nHigh-speed internet connectivity is not a luxury; it is a necessity for 21st century economic success, social mobility, education, health care, and public safety. Despite considerable progress and private investment in the last eight years to close the digital divide, there is more work to do. Democrats will finish the job of connecting every household in America to high-speed broadband, increase internet adoption, and help hook up anchor institutions so they can offer free WiFi to the public. We will take action to help America widely deploy 5G technology—the next generation wireless service that will not only bring faster internet connections to underserved areas, but will enable the Internet of Things and a host of transformative technologies.\nDemocrats support a free and open internet at home and abroad, and will oppose any effort by Republicans to roll back the historic net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission enacted last year.\nDemocrats value American innovation and believe it is one of our country's great strengths. We will protect the intellectual property rights of artists, creators, and inventors at home and abroad. The entire nation prospers when we promote the unique and original artistic and cultural contributions of the women and men who create and preserve our nation's heritage.\nDemocrats will fight against unfair theft of intellectual property and trade secrets. We will increase access to global markets for American intellectual property and other digital trade by opposing quotas, discriminatory measures, and data localization requirements.\nPushing beyond the boundaries of what we know is core to who we are as Americans. Democrats are immensely proud of all that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has done—through its achievements in science, technology and exploration—to better understand our place in the universe and inspire and educate generations of young people in this country to pursue careers in science. Space exploration is a reminder that our capacity for curiosity is limitless, and may be matched only by our ability to achieve great things if we work together. Democrats believe in continuing the spirit of discovery that has animated NASA's exploration of space over the last half century. We will strengthen support for NASA and work in partnership with the international scientific community to launch new missions to space.\nSupporting America's Small Businesses\nThe Democratic Party will make it easier to start and grow a small business in America, unlike Donald Trump, who has often stiffed small businesses—nearly bankrupting some—with his deceptive and reckless corporate practices. By supporting small business and entrepreneurship, we can grow jobs faster in America. We will cut the red tape that holds back small businesses and entrepreneurs. We will open up access to credit because we know that small businesses are some of the best job creators in our country. We will provide tax relief and tax simplification. And we will expand access to new markets because every American small business should be able to tap new markets — whether across their city, across their state, or around the world. Democrats will provide targeted funding and support for entrepreneurship and small business growth in underserved communities. Democrats also realize the critical importance of small businesses as engines of opportunity for women, people of color, tribes, and people in rural America, and will work to nurture entrepreneurship.\nCreating Jobs for America's Young People\nDemocrats will make investments to spur the creation of millions of jobs for our young people. Roughly one in ten Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 is unemployed, more than twice the national average. The unemployment rates for African American, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and American Indian teenagers and youth with disabilities are far too high. That is why Democrats will provide direct federal funding for a range of local programs that will put young people to work and create new career opportunities.\nFight for Economic Fairness and Against Inequality\nDemocrats believe that today's extreme levels of income and wealth inequality are bad for our people, bad for our businesses, and bad for our economy. Our country depends on a thriving middle class to drive economic growth, but the middle class is shrinking. Meanwhile, the top one-tenth of one percent of Americans now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent combined. These trends create problems beyond insulting our sense of basic fairness. Social mobility is far lower than most believe it to be. Children who are born to families in the lowest fifth of earnings are more than 10 times more likely to remain there as adults than they are to earn as much as those in the top fifth. Unless we invest in building a level playing field, we all lose.\nReining in Wall Street and Fixing our Financial System\nTo restore economic fairness, Democrats will fight against the greed and recklessness of Wall Street. Wall Street cannot be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments and making huge profits, all the while thinking that taxpayers will be there to bail them out again. We must tackle dangerous risks in big banks and elsewhere in the financial system. We must make Wall Street work for the job-creating, productive economy—including by making loans more affordable for small- and medium-sized businesses. We need to prohibit Wall Street from picking and choosing which credit agency will rate its products as well as from imposing excessive fees on consumers. And we must hold both individuals and corporations accountable when they break the law. Democrats believe that no bank can be too big to fail and no executive too powerful to jail. Democrats will support stronger criminal laws and civil penalties for Wall Street criminals who prey on the public trust. We also support extending the statute of limitations for prosecuting major financial fraud, and providing the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more resources to prosecute wrongdoing. \"Equal Justice Under Law\" will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.\nWe will also vigorously implement, enforce, and build on President Obama's landmark Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and we will stop dead in its tracks every Republican effort to weaken it. We will stop Republican efforts to hamstring our regulators through budget cuts, and we will ensure they have the resources and independence to fully enforce the law and hold both individuals and corporations accountable when they break the rules. We will also continue to protect consumers and defend the CFPB from Republican attacks. We oppose any efforts to change the CFPB's structure from a single director to a partisan, gridlocked Commission and likewise oppose any efforts to remove the Bureau's independent funding and subject it to the appropriations process. Democrats will also continue to support the CFPB in enforcing foundational civil rights laws protecting against discrimination in consumer lending. Democrats condemn predatory payday lending, and will protect consumers by defending the CFPB and implementing strong new regulations.\nOur goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires. We support a financial transactions tax on Wall Street to curb excessive speculation and high-frequency trading, which has threatened financial markets. We acknowledge that there is room within our party for a diversity of views on a broader financial transactions tax.\nDemocrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well as empower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability, including new authorities to go after risky shadow-banking activities. Banks should not be able to gamble with taxpayers' deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street. Democrats support a variety of ways to stop this from happening, including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall as well as breaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy.\nWe believe that personnel is policy. We will nominate and appoint regulators and officials who are not beholden to the industries they regulate—people with a track record of standing up to power and safeguarding the public trust. We will crack down on the revolving door between the private sector—particularly Wall Street—and the federal government. We will ban golden parachutes for those taking government jobs. We will limit conflicts of interest by requiring bank and corporate regulators to recuse themselves from official work on particular matters that would directly benefit their former employers. And we will bar financial service regulators from lobbying their former colleagues for at least two years.\nWe will protect and defend the Federal Reserve's independence to carry out the dual mandate assigned to it by Congress—for both full employment and low inflation—against threats from new legislation. We will also reform the Federal Reserve to make it more representative of America as a whole, and we will fight to enhance its independence by ensuring that executives of financial institutions are not allowed to serve on the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks or to select members of those boards.\nAt a time when many of the largest banks have shunned communities across America, Democrats believe that we need to give Americans affordable banking options, including by empowering the United States Postal Service to facilitate the delivery of basic banking services.\nPromoting Competition by Stopping Corporate Concentration\nLarge corporations have concentrated their control over markets to a greater degree than Americans have seen in decades—further evidence that the deck is stacked for those at the top. Democrats will take steps to stop corporate concentration in any industry where it is unfairly limiting competition. We will make competition policy and antitrust stronger and more responsive to our economy today, enhance the antitrust enforcement arms of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and encourage other agencies to police anti-competitive practices in their areas of jurisdiction.\nWe support the historic purpose of the antitrust laws to protect competition and prevent excessively consolidated economic and political power, which can be corrosive to a healthy democracy. We support reinvigorating DOJ and FTC enforcement of antitrust laws to prevent abusive behavior by dominant companies, and protecting the public interest against abusive, discriminatory, and unfair methods of commerce. We support President Obama's recent Executive Order, directing all agencies to identify specific actions they can take in their areas of jurisdiction to detect anticompetitive practices—such as tying arrangements, price fixing, and exclusionary conduct—and to refer practices that appear to violate federal antitrust law to the DOJ and FTC.\nMaking the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share of Taxes\nAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we believe the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. Democrats will claw back tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, eliminate tax breaks for big oil and gas companies, and crack down on inversions and other methods companies use to dodge their tax responsibilities. We will make sure that our tax code rewards businesses that make investments and provide good-paying jobs here in the United States, not businesses that walk out on America. We will end deferrals so that American corporations pay United States taxes immediately on foreign profits and can no longer escape paying their fair share of U.S. taxes by stashing profits abroad. We will then use the revenue raised from fixing the corporate tax code to reinvest in rebuilding America and ensuring economic growth that will lead to millions of good-paying jobs.\nWe will ensure those at the top contribute to our country's future by establishing a multimillionaire surtax to ensure millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. In addition, we will shut down the \"private tax system\" for those at the top, immediately close egregious loopholes like those enjoyed by hedge fund managers, restore fair taxation on multimillion dollar estates, and ensure millionaires can no longer pay a lower rate than their secretaries. At a time of near-record corporate profits, slow wage growth, and rising costs, we need to offer tax relief to middle-class families—not those at the top.\nDemocrats believe that no one should be able avoid paying their fair share by hiding money abroad, and that corrupt leaders and terrorists should not be able to use the system of international finance to their advantage. We will work to crack down on tax evasion and promote transparency to fight corruption and terrorism. And we will make sure that law-abiding Americans living abroad are not unfairly penalized by finding the right solutions for them to the requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).\nWe will offer tax relief to hard working, middle-class families for the cost squeeze they have faced for years from rising health care, childcare, education, and other expenses. Donald Trump and the Republican Party would do the opposite and provide trillions in tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations at the expense of working families, seniors, and the health of our economy.\nPromoting Trade That is Fair and Benefits American Workers\nDemocrats acknowledge that for millions of Americans, global trade has failed to live up to its promise—with too many countries breaking the rules and too many corporations outsourcing jobs at the expense of American workers and communities. Over the past three decades, America has signed too many trade deals that have not lived up to the hype. Trade deals often boosted the profits of large corporations, while at the same time failing to protect workers' rights, labor standards, the environment, and public health. We need to end the race to the bottom and develop trade policies that support jobs in America. That is why Democrats believe we should review agreements negotiated years ago to update them to reflect these principles. Any future trade agreements must make sure our trading partners cannot undercut American workers by taking shortcuts on labor policy or the environment. They must not undermine democratic decision-making through special privileges and private courts for corporations, and trade negotiations must be transparent and inclusive.\nDemocrats' priority is to significantly strengthen enforcement of existing trade rules and the tools we have, including by holding countries accountable on currency manipulation and significantly expanding enforcement resources. China and other countries are using unfair trade practices to tilt the playing field against American workers and businesses. When they dump cheap products into our markets, subsidize state-owned enterprises, devalue currencies, and discriminate against American companies, our middle class pays the price. That has to stop. Democrats will use all our trade enforcement tools to hold China and other trading partners accountable—because no country should be able to manipulate their currencies to gain a competitive advantage. While we believe that openness to the world economy is an important source of American leadership and dynamism, we will oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security. We believe any new trade agreements must include strong and enforceable labor and environmental standards in their core text with streamlined and effective enforcement mechanisms. Trade agreements should crack down on the unfair and illegal subsidies other countries grant their businesses at the expense of ours. It should promote innovation of and access to lifesaving medicines. And it should protect a free and open internet. We should never enter into a trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health of American citizens or others around the world. These are the standards Democrats believe must be applied to all trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nBring Americans Together and Remove Barriers to Opportunities\nDemocrats believe that everyone deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We know that there are barriers standing in the way of that goal, from the enduring scourge of systemic racism to our deeply broken immigration system to discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity—and we are committed to facing those problems and fixing them. Being stronger together means reaching communities that have been left out and left behind for too long, from coal country to Indian Country to neighborhoods held back by multigenerational poverty. In America, we do not tear each other down—we lift each other up.\nEnding Systemic Racism\nDemocrats will fight to end institutional and systemic racism in our society. We will challenge and dismantle the structures that define lasting racial, economic, political, and social inequity. Democrats will promote racial justice through fair, just, and equitable governing of all public-serving institutions and in the formation of public policy. Democrats support removing the Confederate battle flag from public properties, recognizing that it is a symbol of our nation's racist past that has no place in our present or our future. We will push for a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and that there is no place for racism in our country.\nClosing the Racial Wealth Gap\nAmerica's economic inequality problem is even more pronounced when it comes to racial and ethnic disparities in wealth and income. It is unacceptable that the median wealth for African Americans and Latino Americans is roughly one-tenth that of white Americans. These disparities are also stark for American Indians and certain Asian American subgroups, and may become even more significant when considering other characteristics such as age, disability status, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\nThe racial wealth and income gaps are the result of policies that discriminate against people of color and constrain their ability to earn income and build assets to the same extent as other Americans. It has accumulated over time and is made worse by ongoing policies and practices. For example, African Americans and Latinos lost more than half of their net worth as a result of the housing crisis and the Great Recession, because they lost jobs at a much faster rate than white workers and because they were disproportionately targeted for subprime, predatory, and fraudulent mortgages during the run-up to the housing crisis.\nDemocrats believe it is long past time to close this racial wealth gap. Disparities in wealth cannot be solved by the free market alone, but instead, the federal government must play a role in eliminating systemic barriers to wealth accumulation for different racial groups and improving opportunities for people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds to build wealth. Federal policies must remove barriers to achieving sustainable homeownership, provide for greater diversity in federal and state contracting practices, incentivize and expand access to retirement investment programs, increase opportunities for quality jobs and education, and challenge the deeply rooted structures that perpetuate and exacerbate current disparities and ultimately stagnate the nation's economic growth and security.\nReforming our Criminal Justice System\nDemocrats are committed to reforming our criminal justice system and ending mass incarceration. Something is profoundly wrong when almost a quarter of the world's prison population is in the United States, even though our country has less than five percent of the world's population. We will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and detention centers. Research and evidence, rather than slogans and sound bites, must guide criminal justice policies.\nWe will rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Across the country, there are police officers inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, deploying creative and effective strategies, and demonstrating that it is possible to prevent crime without relying on unnecessary force. They deserve our respect and support, and we should learn from those examples and build on what works.\nWe will work with police chiefs to invest in training for officers on issues such as de-escalation and the creation of national guidelines for the appropriate use of force. We will encourage better police-community relations, require the use of body cameras, and stop the use of weapons of war that have no place in our communities. We will end racial profiling that targets individuals solely on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, which is un-American and counterproductive. We should report national data on policing strategies and provide greater transparency and accountability. We will require the Department of Justice to investigate all questionable or suspicious police-involved shootings, and we will support states and localities who help make those investigations and prosecutions more transparent, including through reforming the grand jury process. We will assist states in providing a system of public defense that is adequately resourced and which meets American Bar Association standards. And we will reform the civil asset forfeiture system to protect people and remove perverse incentives for law enforcement to \"police for a profit.\"\nInstead of investing in more jails and incarceration, we need to invest more in jobs and education, and end the school-to-prison pipeline. We will remove barriers to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society by \"banning the box,\" expanding reentry programs, and restoring voting rights. We think the next President should take executive action to ban the box for federal employers and contractors, so applicants have an opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications before being asked about their criminal records.\nThe \"war on drugs\" has led to the imprisonment of millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color, without reducing drug use. Whenever possible, Democrats will prioritize prevention and treatment over incarceration when tackling addiction and substance use disorder. We will build on effective models of drug courts, veterans' courts, and other diversionary programs that seek to give nonviolent offenders opportunities for rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration.\nBecause of conflicting federal and state laws concerning marijuana, we encourage the federal government to remove marijuana from the list of \"Schedule 1\" federal controlled substances and to appropriately regulate it, providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization. We believe that the states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana, and those states that want to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so. We support policies that will allow more research on marijuana, as well as reforming our laws to allow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty. And we recognize our current marijuana laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for African Americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites, despite similar usage rates.\nWe will abolish the death penalty, which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment. It has no place in the United States of America. The application of the death penalty is arbitrary and unjust. The cost to taxpayers far exceeds those of life imprisonment. It does not deter crime. And, exonerations show a dangerous lack of reliability for what is an irreversible punishment.\nWe have been inspired by the movements for criminal justice that directly address the discriminatory treatment of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians to rebuild trust in the criminal justice system.\nFixing our Broken Immigration System\nThe United States was founded as, and continues to be, a country of immigrants from throughout the world. It is no coincidence that the Statue of Liberty is one of our most profound national symbols. And that is why Democrats believe immigration is not just a problem to be solved, it is a defining aspect of the American character and our shared history.\nThe Democratic Party supports legal immigration, within reasonable limits, that meets the needs of families, communities, and the economy as well as maintains the United States' role as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety, freedom, and security. People should come to the United States with visas and not through smugglers. Yet, we recognize that the current immigration system is broken.\nMore than 11 million people are living in the shadows, without proper documentation. The immigration bureaucracy is full of backlogs that result in U.S. citizens waiting for decades to be reunited with family members, and green card holders waiting for years to be reunited with their spouses and minor children. The current quota system discriminates against certain immigrants, including immigrants of color, and needs to be reformed to the realities of the 21st century. And there are real questions about our detention and deportation policies that must be addressed.\nDemocrats believe we need to urgently fix our broken immigration system—which tears families apart and keeps workers in the shadows—and create a path to citizenship for law-abiding families who are here, making a better life for their families and contributing to their communities and our country. We should repeal the 3-year, 10-year and permanent bars, which often force persons in mixed status families into the heartbreaking dilemma of either pursuing a green card by leaving the country and their loved ones behind, or remaining in the shadows. We will work with Congress to end the forced and prolonged expulsion from the country that these immigrants endure when trying to adjust their status.\nWe must fix family backlogs and defend against those who would exclude or eliminate legal immigration avenues and denigrate immigrants. Those immigrants already living in the United States, who are assets to their communities and contribute so much to our country, should be incorporated completely into our society through legal processes that give meaning to our national motto: E Pluribus Unum.\nAnd while we continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform, we will defend and implement President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans executive actions to help DREAMers, parents of citizens, and lawful permanent residents avoid deportation. We will build on these actions to provide relief for others, such as parents of DREAMers. We will support efforts by states to make DREAMers eligible for driver's licenses and in-state college tuition. We will invest in culturally-appropriate immigrant integration services, expand access to English language education, and promote naturalization to help the millions of people who are eligible for citizenship take that last step.\nWe believe immigration enforcement must be humane and consistent with our values. We should prioritize those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities, not hardworking families who are contributing to their communities. We will end raids and roundups of children and families, which unnecessarily sow fear in immigrant communities. We disfavor deportations of immigrants who served in our armed forces, and we want to create a faster path for such veterans to citizenship.\nWe should ensure due process for those fleeing violence in Central America and work with our regional partners to address the root causes of violence. We must take particular care with children, which is why we should guarantee government-funded counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration courts. We should consider all available means of protecting these individuals from the threats to their lives and safety—including strengthening in-country and third-country processing, expanding the use of humanitarian parole, and granting Temporary Protected Status.\nWe will promote best practices among local law enforcement, in terms of how they collaborate with federal authorities, to ensure that they maintain and build trust between local law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will also vigorously oversee any programs put in place, to make sure that there are no abuses and no arbitrary deportation programs. We will establish an affirmative process for workers to report labor violations and to request deferred action. We will work to ensure that all Americans—regardless of immigration status—have access to quality health care. That means expanding community health centers, allowing all families to buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges, supporting states that open up their public health insurance programs to all persons, and finally enacting comprehensive immigration reform. And we will expand opportunities for DREAMers to serve in the military and to then receive expedited pathways to citizenship.\nWe will fight to end federal, state, and municipal contracts with for-profit private prisons and private detention centers. In order to end family detention, we will ensure humane alternatives for those who pose no public threat. We recognize that there are vulnerable communities within our immigration system who are often seeking refuge from persecution abroad, such as LGBT families, for whom detention can be unacceptably dangerous.\nWe reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the United States. It is un-American and runs counter to the founding principles of this country.\nFinally, Democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language of Donald Trump. His offensive comments about immigrants and other communities have no place in our society. This kind of rhetoric must be rejected.\nGuaranteeing Civil Rights\nDemocrats will always fight to end discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, language, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. We need to promote civility and speak out against bigotry and other forms of intolerance that have entered our political discourse. It is unacceptable to target, defame, or exclude anyone because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, language, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. While freedom of expression is a fundamental constitutional principle, we must condemn hate speech that creates a fertile climate for violence. We condemn Donald Trump's demonization of prisoners of war, women, Muslims, Mexicans, and people with disabilities; his playing coy with white supremacists; and the climate of bigotry he is creating. We also condemn the recent uptick in other forms of hate speech, like anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\nGuaranteeing Women's Rights\nWe are committed to ensuring full equality for women. Democrats will fight to end gender discrimination in the areas of education, employment, health care, or any other sphere. We will combat biases across economic, political, and social life that hold women back and limit their opportunities and also tackle specific challenges facing women of color. After 240 years, we will finally enshrine the rights of women in the Constitution by passing the Equal Rights Amendment. And we will urge U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\nGuaranteeing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights\nDemocrats applaud last year's decision by the Supreme Court that recognized that LGBT people—like other Americans—have the right to marry the person they love. But there is still much work to be done. LGBT kids continue to be bullied at school, restaurants can refuse to serve transgender people, and same-sex couples are at risk of being evicted from their homes. That is unacceptable and must change. Democrats will fight for the continued development of sex discrimination law to cover LGBT people. We will also fight for comprehensive federal non-discrimination protections for all LGBT Americans, to guarantee equal rights in areas such as housing, employment, public accommodations, credit, jury service, education, and federal funding. We will oppose all state efforts to discriminate against LGBT individuals, including legislation that restricts the right to access public spaces. We support a progressive vision of religious freedom that respects pluralism and rejects the misuse of religion to discriminate. We will combat LGBT youth homelessness and improve school climates. We will support LGBT elders, ensure access to necessary health care, and protect LGBT people from violence—including ending the crisis of violence against transgender Americans. We will also promote LGBT human rights and ensure America's foreign policy is inclusive of LGBT people around the world.\nGuaranteeing Rights for People with Disabilities\nNo one should face discrimination based on disability status. Democrats are committed to realizing the full promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We will protect and expand the right of Americans with disabilities to get the accommodations and support they need to live in integrated community settings. We will improve access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities. We will provide tax relief to help the millions of families caring for aging relatives or family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities. And we will continue to fight for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nRespecting Faith and Service\nDemocrats know that our nation, our communities, and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith in many forms and the countless acts of justice, mercy, and tolerance it inspires. We believe in lifting up and valuing the good work of people of faith and religious organizations and finding ways to support that work where possible.\nWe believe in the power of national service to solve problems and break down barriers by bringing people of all backgrounds together in common purpose. National service expands opportunity for people across America, strengthening our communities and our country. And those who serve earn education awards that they can use for college while building valuable work skills. We will support and strengthen AmeriCorps with the goal that every American who wants to participate in full-time national service will have the opportunity to do so.\nInvesting in Rural America\nWe will work to build a stronger rural and agricultural economy. Democrats will increase funding to support the next generation of farmers and ranchers, with particular attention given to promoting environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. We will encourage programs to protect and enhance family farms, a cherished way of life for millions of Americans. We will expand local food markets and regional food systems and provide a focused safety net to assist family operations that need support during challenging times. And we will promote clean energy leadership and collaborative stewardship of our natural resources, while expanding opportunities in rural communities across America. While the EPA's new Agricultural Worker Protection Standard goes a long way to protect farmworkers from harmful pesticides and herbicides, we recognize there is a lot more we can do. The Democratic Party supports stronger agricultural worker protections including regulation of work hours, elimination of child labor, ensuring adequate housing for migrant workers, and sanitary facilities in the field.\nDemocrats will spur investment to power the rural economy. We support strengthening rural water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure to make rural businesses more competitive. We will expand access to equity capital for businesses and expand the New Markets Tax Credit to better serve rural small businesses. We will promote collaborative stewardship of our natural resources, while developing clean fuels that will grow our economy, lower our energy bills, combat climate change, and make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. We will provide assistance to producers who conserve and improve natural resources on their farms and double loan guarantees that support the bio-based economy's dynamic growth.\nEnding Poverty and Investing in Communities Left Behind\nWe reaffirm our commitment to eliminate poverty. Democrats will develop a national strategy, coordinated across all levels of government, to combat poverty. We will direct more federal resources to lifting up communities that have been left out and left behind, such as the 10-20-30 model, which directs 10 percent of program funds to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years or more. We will also focus on communities that suffer from persistent poverty, including empowerment zones and areas that targeted government data indicate are in persistent poverty.\nIn the richest country in the world, no one, especially our children, should go hungry. This is why Democrats will protect proven programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—our nation's most important anti-hunger program—that help struggling families put food on the table. We will also help people grow their skills through jobs and skills training opportunities. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program should be expanded for low-wage workers not raising children, including extending the credit to young workers starting at age 21. The Child Tax Credit (CTC) should be expanded, for example, by making more of it refundable, or indexed to inflation to stem the erosion of the credit.\nDemocrats will also do more to invest in our most distressed communities—from our cities to coal country to the Rust Belt. We will create good-paying jobs and enhance opportunities by investing in small business, youth employment, and reentry programs for formerly incarcerated people. We will expand and make permanent the New Markets Tax Credit. We will improve safety by repairing crumbling infrastructure in communities that need it most as well as on tribal lands. And we will make investments in affordable housing near good jobs and good schools.\nBuilding Strong Cities and Metro Areas\nDemocrats have a comprehensive agenda to invest in America's cities, grounded on the premise that local leaders are best equipped to create a better future for their residents—but need the resources and flexibility to get the job done. We also recognize there is no easy way to build strong neighborhoods and strong cities, but rather we must address the challenge across many interconnected fronts—from housing, to schools, to jobs, to transportation, to health.\nWe will dramatically increase federal infrastructure funding for our cities—making significant new investments in roads and bridges, public transit, drinking and wastewater systems, broadband, schools, and more. Democrats also will revitalize communities being dragged down by physical decay by building on programs like the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and the Hardest Hit Fund, which have helped cities across the country begin to address these challenges. We will provide resources to help overcome blight, expand Community Development Block Grant funds, provide more housing support to high-poverty communities, and build more affordable rental housing units.\nWe will support entrepreneurship and small business growth in cities by providing mentoring and training to entrepreneurs and small business owners in underserved communities as well as expanding federal funding for the New Markets Tax Credit, community development financial institutions, and the State Small Business Credit Initiative.\nPromoting Arts and Culture\nDemocrats are proud of our support for arts funding and education. We are committed to continuing the policies and programs that have already done so much for our creative arts industry and economy. Investment in the arts strengthens our communities and contributes to our nation's rich cultural heritage. We will continue to support public funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, for the National Endowment for the Humanities, and for programs providing art and music education in primary and secondary schools. The entire nation prospers when we protect and promote the unique artistic and cultural contributions of the women and men who create and preserve our nation's heritage.\nHonoring Indigenous Tribal Nations\nWe have a profound moral and legal responsibility to the Indian tribes—throughout our history we have failed to live up to that trust. That is why the Democratic Party will fulfill, honor, and strengthen to the highest extent possible the United States' fundamental trust responsibility, grounded in the Constitution, treaties, and case law to American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.\nWe recognize the inherent sovereignty of Indian nations and will work to enact laws and policies that strengthen, not reduce, the powers of Indian nations over people who interact with them in Indian Country. We will work on a government-to-government basis to continue to empower Indian nations, and to provide sufficient and meaningful resources to Indian tribes to bolster economic development and self-determination. As Democrats, we will constantly seek to ensure that American Indian communities are safe, healthy, educated, innovative, and prosperous.\nWe will restore tribal lands by continuing to streamline the land-into-trust process and recognize the right of all tribes to protect their lands, air, and waters. We will continue to work on a government-to-government basis to address chronic underfunding, and provide meaningful resources and financial investments that will empower American Indian tribes through increased economic development and infrastructure improvements on tribal lands.\nWe will strengthen the operation of tribal housing programs, and reauthorize the Indian Housing Block Grant Program. We will increase affordable and safe housing and fight to significantly reduce homelessness on and off Indian reservations, especially among Native youth and veterans.\nWe will invest in Indian education from early childhood through higher education. We will fully fund the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), strengthen self-determination to enable culturally-tailored learning unique to each tribal nation, and help to recruit and retain qualified teachers for Native learners. Democrats will continue to support President Obama's Generation Indigenous initiative that has made important strides in promoting new investments and increased engagement with American Indian youth, including by continuing efforts to reform the BIE to provide students attending BIE-funded schools with a world-class culturally-based education. We also support the elimination of school and sports mascots that reflect derogatory stereotypes and that perpetuate racism.\nWe will strengthen tribal sovereignty and tribal jurisdiction by enacting laws and policies that enhance the ability of Indian nations to govern their territories, keep their communities safe, and prosecute crimes committed on tribal lands. We will build on the important provisions in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which reaffirmed the right of Indian tribes to prosecute perpetrators regardless of race who commit domestic violence on tribal lands. Democrats will continue to work to address criminal justice gaps that undermine the safety of tribal communities. And we will back these efforts through robust investments in effective tribal law enforcement and tribal courts.\nWe believe that health care is a core federal trust responsibility, and we support a robust expansion of the health care provided by the Indian Health Service. We will work to fully fund the Indian Health Service, Tribal, and Urban Indian health care system and to ensure that all American Indians have adequate, safe, and affordable access to primary care providers, including oral health, mental health practitioners, and substance abuse treatment options.\nWe acknowledge the past injustices and the misguided, harmful federal and state policies and actions based on outdated and discredited values and beliefs that resulted in the destruction of the Indian nations' economies, social, and religious systems, the taking of their lands, and the creation of intergenerational trauma that exists to this day. We believe that we have a moral and profound duty to honor, respect, and uphold our sacred obligation to the Indian nations and Indian peoples.\nWe will manage for tribal sacred places, and empower tribes to maintain and pass on traditional religious beliefs, languages, and social practices without fear of discrimination or suppression.\nWe also believe that Native children are the future of tribal nations and that the Indian Child Welfare Act is critical to the survival of Indian culture, government, and communities and must be enforced with the statutory intent of the law.\nWe will strengthen Indian voting rights, including improved access to polling locations. We will build on federal programs to reduce the disproportionate incarceration of American Indian and Alaska Native men and women, reduce disparities in prison sentencing, protect the religious rights of Native prisoners, reduce barriers to prisoner reentry, and offer access to housing and employment upon reentry.\nWe are committed to principles of environmental justice in Indian Country and we recognize that nature in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital cycles. We call for a climate change policy that protects tribal resources, protects tribal health, and provides accountability through accessible, culturally appropriate participation and strong enforcement. Our climate change policy will cut carbon emission, address poverty, invest in disadvantaged communities, and improve both air quality and public health. We support the tribal nations efforts to develop wind, solar, and other clean energy jobs.\nWe will engage in meaningful and productive consultation with Tribal Leaders, and will host a White House Tribal Nations Conference annually bringing together cabinet and senior level federal officials to gather input from Tribal Nations when formulating federal policy impacting tribes. Democrats believe that American Indian/Alaska Natives shall be represented in the federal government to properly reflect their needs and will work to appoint American Indian/Alaska Natives to key positions, including retaining a senior level policy position in the White House Domestic Policy Council. We will strengthen the White House Council on Native American Affairs. Democrats will increase engagement with American Indians/Alaska Natives living outside of tribal communities.\nDemocrats also support efforts for self-governance and self-determination of Native Hawaiians. Native Hawaiians are the indigenous, aboriginal people of Hawai'i whose values and culture are the foundation of the Hawaiian Islands. We support proactive actions by the federal government to enhance Native Hawaiian culture, health, language, and education. We recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service to our country by Native Hawaiians.\nFighting for the People of Puerto Rico\nAnd we are committed to addressing the extraordinary challenges faced by our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Many stem from the fundamental question of Puerto Rico's political status. Democrats believe that the people of Puerto Rico should determine their ultimate political status from permanent options that do not conflict with the Constitution, laws, and policies of the United States. Democrats are committed to promoting economic opportunity and good-paying jobs for the hardworking people of Puerto Rico. We also believe that Puerto Ricans must be treated equally by Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that benefit families. Puerto Ricans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws, just as they should be treated equally. All American citizens, no matter where they reside, should have the right to vote for the President of the United States. Finally, we believe that federal officials must respect Puerto Rico's local self-government as laws are implemented and Puerto Rico's budget and debt are restructured so that it can get on a path towards stability and prosperity.\nHonoring the People of the Territories\nWe also recognize and honor the contributions and the sacrifices made in service of our country by the Americans living in the territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. We support self-government and self-determination for the people of the territories, and their right to decide their future status. All Americans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws, just as they should be treated equally. And all American citizens, no matter where they reside, should have the right to vote for the President of the United States. We will work as partners to the people of Guam on military matters, believe veterans from Guam and the Virgin Islands should have access to timely and quality Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) care, and take seriously the unique health care challenges that Pacific Island communities face. And we support reviewing the feasibility of extending the ACA to all the territories and increasing the Medicaid cap. For all those who live under our flag, we support strong economic development and will work towards fair and equitable treatment under federal programs.\nProtect Voting Rights, Fix Our Campaign Finance System, and Restore Our Democracy\nDemocrats know that Americans' right to vote is sacred and fundamental. We believe that we must protect Americans' right to vote, while stopping corporations' outsized influence in elections. We must rectify the Supreme Court decision gutting the Voting Rights Act, which is a profound injustice. We will stop efforts by Republican governors and legislatures to disenfranchise people of color, low-income people, and young people, and prevent these voters from exercising their right to vote through onerous restrictions. We will ensure that election officials comply with voting protections, including provisions mandating bilingual materials and voter assistance. And we will fight to reform our broken campaign finance system, which gives outsized influence to billionaires and big corporations. It's time we give back control of our elections to those to whom it belongs—the American people.\nProtecting Voting Rights\nThe Democratic Party was founded on the promise of an expanded democracy. The right to vote is at the heart of our national vision. It is a core principle of the Democratic Party to maximize voter participation for all Americans. Our democracy suffers when nearly two thirds of our citizens do not or cannot participate, as in the last midterm elections. Democrats believe we must make it easier to vote, not harder.\nWe must restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. We will bring our democracy into the 21st century by expanding early voting and vote-by-mail, implementing universal automatic voter registration and same day voter registration, ending partisan and racial gerrymandering, and making Election Day a national holiday. We will restore voting rights for those who have served their sentences. And we will continue to fight against discriminatory voter identification laws, which disproportionately burden young voters, diverse communities, people of color, low-income families, people with disabilities, the elderly, and women.\nWe support fully funding the Help America Vote Act and will work to fulfill the promise of election reform, including fighting to end long lines at voting booths and ensuring that all registration materials, voting materials, polling places, and voting machines are truly accessible to seniors, Americans with disabilities, and citizens with limited English proficiency. We will support local, county, and state governments in their efforts to upgrade old voting equipment and machines with modern systems, including voter-verified paper ballots, to ensure that all voters are able to exercise this sacred right in the quickest, most convenient, secure and accurate manner possible.\nRepublicans have enacted various voter suppression tactics from Ohio to Florida, and even though some federal courts have already found that these measures go too far, Democrats will continue to fight these laws to preserve the fundamental right to vote. We support efforts to defeat ill-motivated voter suppression tactics. We also support Ohio's proposed Voters Bill of Rights amendment, North Carolina's Moral Monday movement, and similar initiatives to permanently safeguard this inalienable right.\nFixing Our Broken Campaign Finance System\nDemocrats believe we must fight to preserve the essence of the longest standing democracy in the world: a government that represents the American people, not just a handful of powerful and wealthy special interests. We will fight for real campaign finance reform now. Big money is drowning out the voices of everyday Americans, and we must have the necessary tools to fight back and safeguard our electoral and political integrity.\nDemocrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. We need to end secret, unaccountable money in politics by requiring, through executive order or legislation, significantly more disclosure and transparency—by outside groups, federal contractors, and public corporations to their shareholders. We need to amplify the voices of the American people through a small donor matching public financing system. We need to overhaul and strengthen the Federal Election Commission so that there is real enforcement of campaign finance laws. And we need to fight to eliminate super PACs and outside spending abuses.\nOur vision for American democracy is a nation in which all people, regardless of their income, can participate in the political process and can run for office without needing to depend on large contributions from the wealthy and the powerful.\nAppointing Judges\nWe will appoint judges who defend the constitutional principles of liberty and equality for all, and will protect a woman's right to safe and legal abortion, curb billionaires' influence over elections because they understand that Citizens United has fundamentally damaged our democracy, and believe the Constitution protects not only the powerful, but also the disadvantaged and powerless.\nSecuring Statehood for Washington, D.C.\nRestoring our democracy also means finally passing statehood for the District of Columbia, so that the American citizens who reside in the nation's capital have full and equal congressional rights as well as the right to have the laws and budget of their local government respected without Congressional interference.\nStrengthening Management of Federal Government\nDemocrats understand responsible fiscal stewardship is key to American democracy and to the country's long-term economic prosperity. We believe that by making those at the top and the largest corporations pay their fair share we can pay for ambitious progressive investments that create good-paying jobs and offer security to working families without adding to the debt. This stands in contrast to Donald Trump, whose plans could add more than $30 trillion to the debt and who casually suggests defaulting on America's debt, ending more than 200 years in which the full faith and credit of the United States has been sacrosanct.\nWe will also ensure that new spending and tax cuts are offset so that they do not add to the nation's debt over time. We will tackle waste, fraud, and abuse to make sure government dollars are spent wisely and efficiently. Democrats believe that we should not be contracting, outsourcing, or privatizing work that is inherently governmental in nature, including postal services, school services, and state and local government services. We are committed to a strong, effective, accountable civil service, delivering the quality public services Americans have every right to expect.\nDemocrats believe that, in general, the most effective way to identify problems facing our country and develop good solutions is by enacting evidence-based public policy. We recognize the value of data in allowing us to count and carefully consider the needs of different communities. That is why we will preserve and enhance the integrity and accuracy of the census and the American Community Survey (ACS). We will equip the Census Bureau with the resources needed to prepare for and conduct a cost effective, complete and accurate census, as well as improve counting segments of the population that are historically and persistently undercounted, specifically communities of color, immigrants, LGBT people, young children, those with disabilities, and rural and low-income populations. We will also maintain the legal requirement for the public to participate and be counted.\nDemocrats also believe that government services should be culturally and linguistically appropriate and that data should be disaggregated for those communities, like Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, where it is necessary to fully understand and address their needs.\nFinally, Democrats will make government simpler and more user-friendly. The federal government too often operates with websites designed from another era that are too complicated, too hard to use, and rarely designed for mobile phones or tablets. We will build on the creation of the United States Digital Service (USDS) and give it the resources it needs to transform and digitize the top 25 federal government programs that directly serve citizens. We will eliminate internal barriers to government modernization. And we will use technology to improve outcomes and government accountability by embracing prioritized goal setting and performance tracking for the federal government.\nCombat Climate Change, Build a Clean Energy Economy, and Secure Environmental Justice\nClimate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time. Fifteen of the 16 hottest years on record have occurred this century. While Donald Trump has called climate change a \"hoax,\" 2016 is on track to break global temperature records once more. Cities from Miami to Baltimore are already threatened by rising seas. California and the West have suffered years of brutal drought. Alaska has been scorched by wildfire. New York has been battered by superstorms, and Texas swamped by flash floods. The best science tells us that without ambitious, immediate action across our economy to cut carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases, all of these impacts will be far worse in the future. We cannot leave our children a planet that has been profoundly damaged.\nDemocrats share a deep commitment to tackling the climate challenge; creating millions of good-paying middle class jobs; reducing greenhouse gas emissions more than 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050; and meeting the pledge President Obama put forward in the landmark Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases to \"well below\" two degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We believe America must be running entirely on clean energy by mid-century. We will take bold steps to slash carbon pollution and protect clean air at home, lead the fight against climate change around the world, ensure no Americans are left out or left behind as we accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy, and be responsible stewards of our natural resources and our public lands and waters. Democrats reject the notion that we have to choose between protecting our planet and creating good-paying jobs. We can and we will do both.\nBuilding a Clean Energy Economy\nWe are committed to getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources within a decade, with half a billion solar panels installed within four years and enough renewable energy to power every home in the country. We will cut energy waste in American homes, schools, hospitals, and offices through energy efficient improvements; modernize our electric grid; and make American manufacturing the cleanest and most efficient in the world. These efforts will create millions of new jobs and save families and businesses money on their monthly energy bills. We will transform American transportation by reducing oil consumption through cleaner fuels, vehicle electrification increasing the fuel efficiency of cars, boilers, ships, and trucks. We will make new investments in public transportation and build bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure across our urban and suburban areas. Democrats believe the tax code must reflect our commitment to a clean energy future by eliminating special tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies as well as defending and extending tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy.\nDemocrats believe that carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities, and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and help meet our climate goals. Democrats believe that climate change is too important to wait for climate deniers and defeatists in Congress to start listening to science, and support using every tool available to reduce emissions now. Democrats are committed to defending, implementing, and extending smart pollution and efficiency standards, including the Clean Power Plan, fuel economy standards for automobiles and heavy-duty vehicles, building codes and appliance standards. We are also committed to expanding clean energy research and development.\nDemocrats recognize the importance of climate leadership at the local level and know that achieving our national clean energy goals requires an active partnership with states, cities, and rural communities where so much of our country's energy policy is made. We will ensure that those taking the lead on clean energy and energy efficiency have the tools and resources they need to succeed. The federal government should lead by example, which is why we support taking steps to power the government with 100 percent clean electricity.\nDemocrats are committed to closing the Halliburton loophole that stripped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of its ability to regulate hydraulic fracturing, and ensuring tough safeguards are in place, including Safe Drinking Water Act provisions, to protect local water supplies. We believe hydraulic fracturing should not take place where states and local communities oppose it. We will reduce methane emissions from all oil and gas production and transportation by at least 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 through common-sense standards for both new and existing sources and by repairing and replacing thousands of miles of leaky pipes. This will both protect our climate and create thousands of good-paying jobs.\nWe will work to expand access to cost-saving renewable energy by low-income households, create good-paying jobs in communities that have struggled with energy poverty, and oppose efforts by utilities to limit consumer choice or slow clean energy deployment. We will streamline federal permitting to accelerate the construction of new transmission lines to get low-cost renewable energy to market, and incentivize wind, solar, and other renewable energy over the development of new natural gas power plants.\nWe support President Obama's decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. As we continue working to reduce carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gas emissions, we must ensure federal actions do not \"significantly exacerbate\" global warming. We support a comprehensive approach that ensures all federal decisions going forward contribute to solving, not significantly exacerbating, climate change.\nDemocrats believe that our commitment to meeting the climate challenge must also be reflected in the infrastructure investments we make. We need to make our existing infrastructure safer and cleaner and build the new infrastructure necessary to power our clean energy future. To create good-paying middle class jobs that cannot be outsourced, Democrats support high labor standards in clean energy infrastructure and the right to form or join a union, whether in renewable power or advanced vehicle manufacturing. During the clean energy transition, we will ensure landowners, communities of color, and tribal nations are at the table.\nSecuring Environmental and Climate Justice\nDemocrats believe clean air and clean water are basic rights of all Americans. Yet as we saw in Flint, Michigan, low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately home to environmental justice \"hot spots,\" where air pollution, water pollution, and toxic hazards like lead increase health and economic hardship. The impacts of climate change will also disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities, tribal nations, and Alaska Native villages—all of which suffer the worst losses during extreme weather and have the fewest resources to prepare. Simply put, this is environmental racism.\nDemocrats believe we must make it a national priority to eradicate lead poisoning, which disproportionately impacts low-income children and children of color and can lead to lifelong health and educational challenges. We will prioritize hiring and training workers from affected communities to clean up toxic brownfields and expand clean energy, energy efficiency, and resilient infrastructure.\nThe fight against climate change must not leave any community out or behind—including the coal communities who kept America's lights on for generations. Democrats will fight to make sure these workers and their families get the benefits they have earned and the respect they deserve, and we will make new investments in energy-producing communities to help create jobs and build a brighter and more resilient economic future. We will also oppose threats to the public health of these communities from harmful and dangerous extraction practices, like mountaintop removal mining operations.\nAll corporations owe it to their shareholders to fully analyze and disclose the risks they face, including climate risk. Those who fail to do so should be held accountable. Democrats also respectfully request the Department of Justice to investigate allegations of corporate fraud on the part of fossil fuel companies accused of misleading shareholders and the public on the scientific reality of climate change.\nProtecting Our Public Lands and Waters\nDemocrats believe in the conservation and collaborative stewardship of our shared natural heritage: the public lands and waterways, the oceans, Everglades, Great Lakes, the Arctic, and all that makes America's great outdoors priceless. As a nation, we need policies and investments that will keep America's public lands public, strengthen protections for our natural and cultural resources, increase access to parks and public lands for all Americans, protect native species and wildlife, and harness the immense economic and social potential of our public lands and waters.\nDemocrats will work to establish an American Parks Trust Fund to help expand local, state, and national recreational opportunities, rehabilitate existing parks, and enhance America's great outdoors—from our forests and coasts to neighborhood parks—so \"America's Best Idea\" is held in trust for future generations, and all Americans can access and enjoy natural spaces. Democrats are committed to doubling the size of the outdoor economy, creating nearly hundreds of billions of dollars in new economic activity and millions of new jobs.\nDemocrats will approach conservation of our public lands and waters in a way that reflects the diversity of our country, by actively engaging all Americans in the great outdoors and protecting natural landscapes and cultural sites that tell the story of America's complex history. To help meet these goals, we will work to build a diverse workforce in agencies that manage America's public lands, waters, and cultural sites.\nWe oppose drilling in the Arctic and off the Atlantic coast, and believe we need to reform fossil fuel leasing on public lands. We will phase down extraction of fossil fuels from our public lands, starting with the most polluting sources, while making our public lands and waters engines of the clean energy economy and creating jobs across the country. Democrats will work to expand the amount of renewable energy production on federal lands and waters, from wind in Wyoming to solar in Nevada.\nDemocrats oppose efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act to protect threatened and endangered species.\nBecause the Bristol Bay drainages of Alaska produce the world's largest salmon fisheries, we support efforts by the EPA under the Clean Water Act to establish proactively science-based restrictions on discharges of dredged or fill material associated with a potential Pebble mine and urge that such restrictions must apply to potential mines at other metallic sulfide deposits in those drainages.\nAgricultural lands account for nearly half of the total land area in America and our agricultural practices have a significant impact on our water, land, oceans, and the climate. Therefore, we believe that in order to be effective in keeping our air and water clean and combating climate change, we must enlist farmers as partners in promoting conservation and stewardship.\nProvide Quality and Affordable Education\nDemocrats know that every child, no matter who they are, how much their families earn, or where they live, should have access to a high-quality education, from preschool through high school and beyond. But the United States still lags behind other advanced economies in providing high-quality, universal preschool programs to help all of our kids get a strong start to their educations. Our schools are more segregated today than they were when Brown v. Board of Education was decided, and we see wide disparities in educational outcomes across racial and socioeconomic lines. A college degree or another form of post-secondary education is increasingly required for jobs that pay a middle-class wage, but graduation rates have stagnated for low-income students. And the high cost of college has required too many Americans to take out staggering student loans or put a degree out of reach entirely. We are selling our children and our young people short. Democrats are committed to making good public schools available to every child, no matter what zip code they live in, and at last making debt-free college a reality for all Americans.\nMaking Debt-Free College a Reality\nDemocrats believe that in America, if you want a higher education, you should always be able to get one: money should never stand in the way. Cost should not be a barrier to getting a degree or credential, and debt should not hold you back after you graduate. Bold new investments by the federal government, coupled with states reinvesting in higher education and colleges holding the line on costs, will ensure that Americans of all backgrounds will be prepared for the jobs and economy of the future. Democrats are unified in their strong belief that every student should be able to go to college debt-free, and working families should not have to pay any tuition to go to public colleges and universities.\nWe will also make community college free, while ensuring the strength of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions. The federal government will push more colleges and universities to take quantifiable, affirmative steps in increasing the percentages of racial and ethnic minority, low-income, and first-generation students they enroll and graduate. Achieving these goals depends on state and federal investment in both students and their teachers. Whether full-time or adjunct, faculty must be supported to make transformative educational experiences possible.\nProviding Relief from Crushing Student Debt\nAs we make college affordable for future students, we will not forget about the millions of borrowers with unsustainable levels of student debt, who need help right now. Democrats will allow those who currently have student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest rates possible. We will simplify and expand access to income-based repayment so that no student loan borrowers ever have to pay more than they can afford. And we will significantly cut interest rates for future undergraduates because we believe that making college more affordable is more important than the federal government making billions of dollars in profit off those loans. Democrats will also fight for a student borrower bill of rights to ensure borrowers get adequate information about options to avoid or get out of delinquency or default. We will hold lenders and loan servicers to high standards to help borrowers in default rehabilitate and repay their debts. We will continue the important Public Service Loan Forgiveness and loan discharge programs begun by the Obama Administration. Finally, Democrats will restore the prior standard in bankruptcy law to allow borrowers with student loans to be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy as a measure of last resort. To make progress toward these goals, the government should offer a moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers so they have the time and get the resources they need to consolidate their loans, enroll in income-based repayment programs, and take advantage of opportunities to reduce monthly payments and fees.\nSupporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions\nWe will strengthen our nation's public and private Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Predominantly Black Institutions, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions, and minority-serving institutions. Many of these schools educate disproportionate percentages of growing populations of Americans: students who are racial and ethnic minorities, low-income students, and first-generation students. As the nation is grappling with how to expand educational access and increase success, especially for communities of color and low-income students and families, there is evidence that the nation's HBCUs and Minority Serving Institutions have honed promising models for educating these students to prepare them for high- and critical-need positions while containing costs. We will create a robust and historic dedicated fund to keep costs down, provide quality education, and ensure dedicated support to improve student outcomes and completion rates. We will provide further assistance to students at these schools, as well as other students across the country, by restoring year-round Pell funding so that low- and middle-income students from all backgrounds can get the support they need to make progress toward a college degree throughout the year.\nCracking Down on Predatory For-Profit Schools\nWe will continue to crack down on for-profit schools that take millions in federal financial aid—often as their principal source of revenue—and then exploit students and burden them with debt rather than educating them. That is why we will strengthen the gainful employment rule to ensure that for-profit schools enable students to complete their degrees and prepare them for work. We will go after for-profits that engage in deceptive marketing, fraud, and other illegal practices. We will also exercise our responsibility in oversight over the Department of Education to carry out their obligation to close down those for-profit schools that consistently engage in fraudulent and illegal conduct. It is unacceptable that for-profit schools with low graduation rates keep encouraging their students to take out federal loans they will have trouble paying back. Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, we will also encourage widespread relief and the forgiveness of debt to those students harmed by the practices of fraudulent institutions.\nGuaranteeing Universal Preschool and Good Schools for Every Child\nDemocrats believe we must have the best-educated population and workforce in the world. That means making early childhood education and universal preschool a priority, especially in light of new research showing how much early learning can impact life-long success. Democrats will invest in early childhood programs like Early Head Start and provide every family in America with access to high-quality childcare and high-quality preschool programs. We support efforts to raise wages for childcare workers, and to ensure that early childhood educators are experienced and high-quality.\nWe will ensure there are great schools for every child no matter where they live. Democrats know the federal government must play a critical role in making sure every child has access to a world-class education. We believe that a strong public education system is an anchor of our democracy, a propeller of the economy, and the vehicle through which we help all children achieve their dreams. Public education must engage students to be critical thinkers and civic participants while addressing the wellbeing of the whole child.\nWe also support increased investments in afterschool and summer learning programs, which help working families, keep kids safe, and inspire learning at a time when many students are left unsupervised. We must find ways to encourage mentoring programs that support students in reaching their full potential. Mentoring is a strategy to ensure that children living in poverty have the encouragement and support to aim high and enter the middle class. We will focus on group mentoring, which is a low-cost, high-yield investment that offers the benefit of building a supportive network of peers who push one another towards success.\nDemocrats believe all students should be taught to high academic standards. Schools should have adequate resources to provide programs and support to help meet the needs of every child. We will hold schools, districts, communities, and states accountable for raising achievement levels for all students—particularly low-income students, students of color, English Language Learners, and students with disabilities.\nWe must fulfill our national commitment to provide a meaningful education to students with disabilities, and work towards full funding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act so that students with disabilities can receive the extra resources and services they need. With an appropriate educational foundation, children with disabilities can thrive and become adults with greater opportunities and more meaningful life experiences.\nWe are also deeply committed to ensuring that we strike a better balance on testing so that it informs, but does not drive, instruction. To that end, we encourage states to develop a multiple measures approach to assessment, and we believe that standardized tests must be reliable and valid. We oppose high-stakes standardized tests that falsely and unfairly label students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners as failing; the use of standardized test scores as basis for refusing to fund schools or to close schools; and the use of student test scores in teacher and principal evaluations, a practice which has been repeatedly rejected by researchers. We support enabling parents to opt their children out of standardized tests without penalty for either the student or their school.\nDemocrats recognize and honor all the professionals who work in public schools to support students' education—teachers, education support professionals, and specialized staff. We know that good teachers are essential to improving student learning and helping all students to meet high academic standards. Democrats will launch a national campaign to recruit and retain high-quality teachers. We will ensure that teachers receive the tools and ongoing professional development they need to succeed in the classroom and provide our children with a world-class education. We also must lift up and trust our educators, continually build their capacity, and ensure that our schools are safe, welcoming, collaborative, and well-resourced places for our students, educators, and communities.\nWe will invest in high-quality STEAM classes, community schools, computer science education, arts education, and expand link learning models and career pathways. We will end the school-to-prison pipeline by opposing discipline policies which disproportionately affect African Americans and Latinos, Native Americans and Alaska Natives, students with disabilities, and youth who identify as LGBT. We will support the use of restorative justice practices that help students and staff resolve conflicts peacefully and respectfully while helping to improve the teaching and learning environment. And we will work to improve school culture and combat bullying of all kinds.\nThe Democratic Party is committed to eliminating opportunity gaps—particularly those that lead to students from low-income communities arriving on day one of kindergarten several years behind their peers. This means advocating for labor and public assistance laws that ensure poor parents can spend time with their children. This means raising household incomes in poor communities. It means ensuring children have health care, stable housing free of contaminants, and a community free of violence in order to minimize the likelihood of cognitive delays. It means enriching early childhood programming to prepare children in areas such as literacy, numeracy, civic engagement, and emotional intelligence. It means supporting equitable and adequate state funding for public education, and expanding Title I funding for schools that serve a large number or high concentration of children in poverty. It means ending curriculum gaps that maintain and exacerbate achievement gaps.\nWe support policies that motivate rather than demoralize our educators. We are committed to ensuring that schools that educate children in poverty are not treated unfairly, which is why we will end the test-and-punish version of accountability that does no more than reveal the many opportunity gaps facing students from low-income communities.\nDemocrats are committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support democratically governed, great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-profit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources. We believe that high-quality public charter schools should provide options for parents, but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools. Charter schools must reflect their communities, and thus must accept and retain proportionate numbers of students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners in relation to their neighborhood public schools. We support increased transparency and accountability for all charter schools.\nEnsure the Health and Safety of All Americans\nDemocrats have been fighting to secure universal health care for the American people for generations, and we are proud to be the party that passed Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Being stronger together means finally achieving that goal. We are going to fight to make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. We will tackle the problems that remain in our health care system, including cracking down on runaway prescription drug prices and addressing mental health with the same seriousness that we treat physical health. We will fight Republican efforts to roll back the clock on women's health and reproductive rights, and stand up for Planned Parenthood. And we will tackle the epidemics of substance abuse and gun violence, which each claim tens of thousands of lives every year.\nSecuring Universal Health Care\nDemocrats believe that health care is a right, not a privilege, and our health care system should put people before profits. Thanks to the hard work of President Obama and Democrats in Congress, we took a critically important step toward the goal of universal health care by passing the Affordable Care Act, which has covered 20 million more Americans and ensured millions more will never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Democrats will never falter in our generations-long fight to guarantee health care as a fundamental right for every American. As part of that guarantee, Americans should be able to access public coverage through a public option, and those over 55 should be able to opt in to Medicare. Democrats will empower the states, which are the true laboratories of democracy, to use innovation waivers under the ACA to develop unique locally tailored approaches to health coverage. This will include removing barriers to states which seek to experiment with plans to ensure universal health care to every person in their state. By contrast, Donald Trump wants to repeal the ACA, leaving tens of millions of Americans without coverage.\nFor too many of us, health care costs are still too high, even for those with insurance. And medical debt is a problem for far too many working families, with one-quarter of Americans reporting that they or someone in their household had problems or an inability to pay medical bills in the past year. Democrats will also work to end surprise billing and other practices that lead to out-of-control medical debt that place an unconscionable economic strain on American households. We will repeal the excise tax on high-cost health insurance and find revenue to offset it because we need to contain the long-term growth of health care costs, but should not risk passing on too much of the burden to workers. Democrats will keep costs down by making premiums more affordable, reducing out-of-pocket expenses, and capping prescription drug costs. And we will fight against insurers trying to impose excessive premium increases.\nDemocrats will fight any attempts by Republicans in Congress to privatize, voucherize, or \"phase out\" Medicare as we know it. And we will oppose Republican plans to slash funding and block grant Medicaid and SNAP, which would harm millions of Americans.\nWe will keep fighting until the ACA's Medicaid expansion has been adopted in every state. Nineteen states have not yet expanded Medicaid. This means that millions of low-income Americans still lack health insurance and are not getting the care they need. Additionally, health care providers, clinics, hospitals, and taxpayers are footing a higher bill when people without insurance visit expensive emergency rooms.\nDemocrats believe your zip code or census tract should not be a predictor of your health, which is why we will make health equity a central part of our commitment to revitalizing communities left behind. Democrats believe that all health care services should be culturally and linguistically appropriate, and that neither fear nor immigration status should be barriers that impede health care access.\nSupporting Community Health Centers\nWe must renew and expand our commitment to Community Health Centers, as well as community mental health centers and family planning centers. These health centers provide critically important, community-based prevention and treatment in underserved communities, prevent unnecessary and expensive trips to emergency rooms, and are essential to the successful implementation of the ACA. We will fight for a comprehensive system of primary health care, including dental, mental health care, and low-cost prescription drugs by doubling of funding for federally qualified community health centers over the next decade, which currently serve 25 million people.\nDemocrats also know that one of the key ingredients to the success of these health centers is a well-supported and qualified workforce in community-based settings. We will fight to train and support this workforce, encourage providers to work with underserved populations through the National Health Service Corps, and create a comprehensive strategy to increase the pool of primary health care professionals.\nReducing Prescription Drug Costs\nIt is unacceptable that the United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and that too many Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. A lifesaving drug is no good if it is unaffordable to the very people who need it most. And many drug companies are spending more on advertising than on research. The largest pharmaceutical companies are making billions of dollars per year in profits at higher margins compared to other industries while many stash their profits in offshore tax havens.\nMeanwhile, they charge Americans thousands of dollars for new drugs—often at much higher costs than in other developed nations. Democrats are committed to investing in the research, development, and innovation that creates lifesaving drugs and lowers overall health costs, but the profiteering of pharmaceutical companies is simply unacceptable.\nWe will crack down on price gouging by drug companies and cap the amount Americans have to pay out-of-pocket every month on prescription drugs. We will prohibit anti-competitive \"pay for delay\" deals that keep generic drugs off the market, and we will allow individuals, pharmacists, and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies in Canada and other countries with appropriate safety protections. Democrats will also fight to make sure that Medicare will negotiate lower prices with drug manufacturers.\nEnabling Cutting-Edge Medical Research\nDemocrats believe we must accelerate the pace of medical progress, ensuring that we invest more in our scientists and give them the resources they need to invigorate our fundamental studies in the life sciences in a growing, stable, and predictable way. We must make progress against the full range of diseases, including Alzheimer's, HIV and AIDS, cancer, and other diseases, especially chronic ones. We recognize the critical importance of a fully-funded National Institutes of Health to accelerate the pace of medical progress.\nCombating Drug and Alcohol Addiction\nWe must confront the epidemic of drug and alcohol addiction, specifically the opioid crisis and other drugs plaguing our communities, by vastly expanding access to prevention and treatment, supporting recovery, helping community organizations, and promoting better practices by prescribers. The Democratic Party is committed to assisting the estimated 20 million people struggling with addiction in this country to find and sustain healthy lives by encouraging full recovery and integration into society and working to remove common barriers to gainful employment, housing, and education. We will continue to fight to expand access to care for addiction services, and ensure that insurance coverage is equal to that for any other health conditions. We think it is time for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, and state regulatory agencies to fully implement the protections of the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act of 2008—which means that American medical insurers, including the federal government, will need to disclose how they make their medical management decisions.\nWe should also do more to educate our youth, as well as their families, teachers, coaches, mentors, and friends, to intervene early to prevent drug and alcohol abuse and addiction. We should help state and local leaders establish evidence-based, age-appropriate, and locally-tailored prevention programs. These programs include school-based drug education programs that have been shown to have meaningful effects on risky behavior; community-based peer mentorship and leadership programs; and after-school activities that deter drug use and encourage life skills.\nTreating Mental Health\nWe must treat mental health issues with the same care and seriousness that we treat issues of physical health, support a robust mental health workforce, and promote better integration of the behavioral and general health care systems. Recognizing that maintaining good mental health is critical to all people, including young people's health and development, we will work with health professionals to ensure that all children have access to mental health care. We must also expand community-based treatment for substance abuse disorders and mental health conditions and fully enforce our parity law. And we should create a national initiative around suicide prevention across the lifespan—to move toward the HHS-promoted Zero Suicide commitment.\nSupporting Those Living with Autism and their Families\nDemocrats believe that our country must make supporting the millions of individuals with autism and those diagnosed in the future and their families a priority. We will conduct a nationwide early screening outreach campaign to ensure that all children, and in particular children from underserved backgrounds, can get screened for autism. We will expand services and support for adults and individuals transitioning into adulthood, including employment and housing assistance. And we will push states to require health insurance coverage for autism services in private insurance plans as well as state marketplaces so that people with autism are not denied care.\nSecuring Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice\nDemocrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to women's, men's, and young people's health and wellbeing. We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman's access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment. We condemn and will combat any acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of reproductive health providers, patients, and staff. We will defend the ACA, which extends affordable preventive health care to women, including no-cost contraception, and prohibits discrimination in health care based on gender.\nWe will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on gender, sexuality, race, income, disability, and other factors. We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions.\nAnd we strongly and unequivocally support a woman's decision to have a child, including by ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and by providing services during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including adoption and social support services, as well as protections for women against pregnancy discrimination. We are committed to creating a society where children are safe and can thrive physically, emotionally, educationally, and spiritually. We recognize and support the importance of civil structures that are essential to creating this for every child.\nEnsuring Long-Term Care, Services, and Supports\nOur country faces a long-term care crisis that prevents too many seniors and people with disabilities from being able to live with dignity at home or in their communities. The vast majority of people who are aging or living with a disability want to do so at home, but face challenges finding and affording the support they need to do so. Programs that emphasize independence rather than institutionalization must be better structured to support them. Democrats will take steps to strengthen and expand the home care workforce, give seniors and people with disabilities access to quality, affordable long-term care, services, and supports, and ensure that all of these resources are readily available at home or in the community.\nProtecting and Promoting Public Health\nInvestment in our nation's crumbling public health infrastructure is critical to ensuring preparedness for emerging threats; for preventing disease, illness, and injury in communities; and for promoting good health and wellbeing. Inadequate access to public health services has a disparate impact on poor, rural, and minority communities where public health services are a significant source of health care. Democrats will fight for increased investments in public health to better address emerging threats and the needs across our country. To further that end, the Democratic Party will continue to oppose Republican attempts to cut public health services and funding. We will ensure adequate funding of public health education at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels as well as adequate funding of residency training programs in public health, preventive medicine, and its subspecialties.\nWe must take a number of proactive steps so that all Americans—regardless of location, income or history—have the opportunity to live full, healthy lives. Democrats will fight for increased investments and coordination in public health to better address emerging threats as well as persistent needs across our country. Health equity among Americans remains elusive—higher income is strongly associated with longer life expectancy and the gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest Americans is increasing. We continue to see unacceptable differences in health outcomes by race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. A growing body of research demonstrates the link between social factors—such as poverty, unemployment, experience of discrimination, and housing instability—and poor health. Democrats will continue to pursue policies addressing these social factors and empowering communities to respond to their most pressing health needs.\nEnding Violence Against Women\nDemocrats are committed to ending the scourge of violence against women wherever it occurs —whether in our homes, streets, schools, military, or elsewhere. We will continue to support the Violence Against Women Act to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to combat this problem. We will support comprehensive services for survivors of violence and increase prevention efforts in our communities and on our campuses. Democrats will fight to bring an end to sexual assault—wherever it occurs, including on campuses— because everyone deserves a safe environment where they can learn and thrive, not live in fear. We will provide comprehensive support to survivors, and ensure a fair process for all on-campus disciplinary proceedings and in the criminal justice system. We will increase sexual violence prevention education programs that cover issues like consent and bystander intervention, not only in college, but also in secondary school.\nPreventing Gun Violence\nWith 33,000 Americans dying every year, Democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence. While responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in America have suffered from gun violence. We can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. To build on the success of the lifesaving Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy; and keep weapons of war—such as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines (LCAM's)—off our streets. We will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. There is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue.\nPrincipled Leadership\nDemocrats believe that America must lead in the world to grow our economy, protect our interests and values, and make our country safer and more prosperous. We cannot walk away from our position of global leadership and allow other countries to make decisions about our lives, jobs, and safety.\nDemocrats further believe that when America leads, it must be as a principled force for peace and prosperity in the world. We believe all people deserve to live in dignity and have their rights respected. We believe protecting rights and opportunities for women and girls is essential for security and economic growth. We believe providing access to education and employment for young people and safeguarding the rights of minorities is important to ensuring stability. We believe the smart use of diplomacy, development, and economic statecraft can prevent crises, foster stability, and make us safer. And we believe that we are stronger when we work with our partners and allies, rather than try to go it alone. Our global network of alliances is not a burden—it is a source of tremendous strategic advantage.\nWe believe that while our military must be the strongest in the world, it should only be sent into combat when the terms of engagement are clearly presented to the American people and our troops have what they need to fulfill their mission. We believe that war must always be the last resort, never the first choice.\nThese principles have underpinned important progress in the last eight years. When President Obama and Vice President Biden assumed office, the world economy was in the worst crisis since the Great Depression, our alliances were strained, Osama bin Laden remained at large, Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon, and we were mired in two costly wars. We brought bin Laden to justice, crippled al Qaeda's core leadership, saved America from a second Great Depression, repaired our alliances, reestablished relations with Cuba while pressing for reforms, and—without firing a shot, dropping a bomb, or putting a single American soldier in harm's way—blocked Iran's ability to pursue a nuclear weapon. America is stronger abroad and safer at home because of this principled leadership.\nBut there is much more to do to keep our country prosperous and safe. From defeating terrorism and combating climate change to managing China's rise and strengthening our nation's cybersecurity, the next Democratic administration will confront the complex challenges that lie ahead by staying true to our principles and core values.\nDonald Trump has a different approach. There has never been a major party candidate less qualified or less fit for the office of President of the United States or to be Commander-in-Chief than Donald Trump. He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He thinks our military should engage in war crimes. He wants to build walls and keep people—including Americans—from entering the country based on their race, religion, ethnicity, and national origin. He has no strategy for dealing with key threats facing our country, including climate change and ISIS. He wants to abandon our allies and empower our adversaries. His dangerous, incoherent policies would undo the progress we have made.\nDonald Trump believes America is weak and an embarrassment. We believe America is unlike any other nation on earth. Our ingenuity is unparalleled, our military unrivaled, our economy the largest, most dynamic, and innovative, and our values an enduring source of strength and inspiration the world over. We are not a country that cowers behind walls. We lead with purpose. With American leadership, guided by our principles and in concert with our allies and partners, the coming years can be the most stable, secure, and prosperous time we and the world have ever known.\nSupport Our Troops and Keep Faith with Our Veterans\nDemocrats believe America must continue to have the strongest military in the world. Donald Trump has called our military \"a disaster.\" We reject that view of our brave men and women in serving in the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. They perform admirably while sacrificing immeasurably.\nDefense Spending\nWe support a smart, predictable defense budget that meets the strategic challenges we face, not the arbitrary cuts that the Republican Congress enacted as part of sequestration. We must prioritize military readiness by making sure our Active, Reserve, and National Guard components remain the best trained and equipped in the world. We will seek a more agile and flexible force and rid the military of outdated Cold War-era systems.\nWe must end waste in the defense budget. We will audit the Pentagon, launch a high-level commission to review the role of defense contractors, and take greater action against those who have been involved in fraud. And we will ensure that the Department of Defense invests its budget wisely.\nVeterans and Service Members\nOur country has a sacred, moral responsibility to keep faith with all our veterans and wounded warriors. We must take care of those who have put their lives on the line to defend us. That is why we will push for more educational benefits and job training, end chronic homelessness and combat suicide, and protect and preserve the post-9/11 GI Bill for future generations. We will also ensure that reservists and Guard members are treated fairly when it comes to employment, health, education benefits, deployment, and reintegration.\nWe are outraged by the systemic problems plaguing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We will fight for every veteran to have timely access to high-quality health care and timely processing of claims and appeals. We must also look for more ways to make certain the VA provides veteran-centric care, such as providing women with full and equal treatment, including reproductive health services; expanding mental health programs; continuing efforts to identify and treat invisible, latent, and toxic wounds of war; treating post-traumatic stress; and expanding the post-9/11 veteran's caregiver program to include all veterans. We reject attempts by Republicans to sell out the needs of veterans by privatizing the VA. We believe that the VA must be fully resourced so that every veteran gets the care that he or she has earned and deserves, including those suffering from sexual assault, mental illness and other injuries or ailments.\nMilitary Families\nDemocrats honor the sacrifice of military families who serve alongside our service members. We recognize the unique concerns and challenges they face, especially after 15 years of continuous deployments. We will support military families with jobs, education, childcare, and health care. We will promote family-friendly policies and champion efforts to care for our military family members, especially for the spouses and children who have to rebuild their lives after the loss of a loved one or life-altering injury or disability.\nA Strong Military\nDemocrats welcome and honor all Americans who want to serve and will continue to fight for their equal rights and recognition. We are proud of the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and we commit ourselves to insuring fair treatment for LGBT veterans, including by proactively reviewing and upgrading discharge records for veterans who were discharged because of their sexual orientation. We are also proud of the opening of combat positions to women. Our military is strongest when people of all races, religions, sexual orientations, and gender identities are honored for their service to our country.\nDemocrats are committed to addressing the scourge of military sexual assault. We must increase efforts to prevent sexual assault and rape, and aggressively investigate and prosecute allegations. And we must make sure victims receive timely, appropriate and comprehensive treatment for physical, emotional, and psychological trauma resulting from sexual assault.\nConfront Global Threats\nDemocrats will protect our country. We will strengthen our homeland security, deal wisely and firmly with those who seek to imperil America or our partners, deter aggression, and promote peace. We will use all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to confront global threats and ensure war is the last resort.\nTerrorism\nWe must defeat ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates, and prevent other groups from emerging in their place. Democrats will continue to lead a broad coalition of allies and partners to destroy ISIS' stronghold in Iraq and Syria. We will press those in the region, especially the Gulf countries and local forces on the ground, to carry their weight in prosecuting this fight. We will dismantle the global network of terror, which supplies terrorists with money, arms, and fighters, and stop them from recruiting and inspiring potential radicals. We will improve our intelligence capabilities, with appropriate safeguards here at home, and ensure that the intelligence community and law enforcement is prepared to deal effectively with the threats we face. We will harden our defenses as well as those of our partners against external and homegrown threats. We will secure the homeland, investing more resources to improve mass transit, aviation, infrastructure, and port security. And we will remain a resilient nation, always coming together to stand up to terror.\nDemocrats will seek an updated Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that is more precise about our efforts to defeat ISIS and that does not involve large-scale combat deployment of American troops.\nAs we prosecute the fight against terrorism, Democrats will repudiate vile tactics that would do us harm. We reject Donald Trump's vilification of Muslims. It violates the religious freedom that is the bedrock of our country and feeds into ISIS' nefarious narrative. It also alienates people and countries who are crucial to defeating terrorism; the vast majority of Muslims believe in a future of peace and tolerance. We reject Donald Trump's suggestion that our military should engage in war crimes, like torturing prisoners or murdering civilian family members of suspected terrorists. These tactics run counter to American principles, undermine our moral standing, cost innocent lives, and endanger Americans. We also firmly reject Donald Trump's willingness to mire tens of thousands of our combat troops in another misguided ground war in the Middle East, which would only further embolden ISIS. There is nothing smart or strong about such an approach.\nSyria\nThe Syrian crisis is heartbreaking and dangerous, and its impact is threatening the region, Europe, and beyond. Donald Trump would inflame the conflict by alienating our allies, inexplicably allowing ISIS to expand in Syria, and potentially starting a wider war. This is a reckless approach. Democrats will instead root out ISIS and other terrorist groups and bring together the moderate Syrian opposition, international community, and our regional allies to reach a negotiated political transition that ends Assad's rule. Given the immense scale of human suffering in Syria, it is also imperative that we lead the international community in providing greater humanitarian assistance to the civilian victims of war in Syria and Iraq, especially displaced refugees.\nAfghanistan\nIn Afghanistan, we will work with the NATO-led coalition of partners to bolster the democratically-elected government as it assumes a primary role in tackling terrorism, forges a more secure future for the country, and safeguards advances, like securing women's rights. Democrats will continue to push for an Afghan-led peace process and press both Afghanistan and Pakistan to deny terrorists sanctuary on either side of the border. We support President Obama's decision to maintain a limited troop presence in Afghanistan into 2017 and ensure that Afghanistan never again serves as a haven for terrorists to plan and launch attacks on our homeland.\nIran\nWe support the nuclear agreement with Iran because, as it is vigorously enforced and implemented, it verifiably cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a bomb without resorting to war. We reject Donald Trump's view that we should have walked away from a deal that peacefully dismantles Iran's nuclear program. We will continue the work of this administration to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon and will not hesitate to take military action if Iran races towards one.\nDemocrats will also address the detrimental role Iran plays in the region and will robustly enforce and, if necessary, strengthen non-nuclear sanctions. Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism. It violates the human rights of its population, denies the Holocaust, vows to eliminate Israel, and has its fingerprints on almost every conflict in the Middle East. Democrats will push back against Iran's destabilizing activities including its support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, counter Iran's ballistic missile program, bolster the capabilities of our Gulf partners, and ensure that Israel always has the ability to defend itself. Finally, Democrats recognize that the Iranian people seek a brighter future for their country and greater engagement with the international community. We will embrace opportunities for cultural, academic and other exchanges with the Iranian people.\nNorth Korea\nNorth Korea is perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator. It has conducted several nuclear tests and is attempting to develop the capability to put a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile that could directly threaten the United States. The regime is also responsible for grave human rights abuses against the North Korean people. Yet Donald Trump praises North Korea's dictator; threatens to abandon our treaty allies, Japan and South Korea; and encourages the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. This approach is incoherent and rather than solving a global crisis, would create a new one. Democrats will protect America and our allies, press China to restrain North Korea, and sharpen the choices for Pyongyang to compel it to abandon its illegal nuclear and missile programs.\nRussia\nRussia is engaging in destabilizing actions along its borders, violating Ukraine's sovereignty and attempting to recreate spheres of influence that undermine American interests. It is also propping up the Assad regime in Syria, which is brutally attacking its own citizens. Donald Trump would overturn more than 50 years of American foreign policy by abandoning NATO partners—countries who help us fight terrorism every day—and embracing Russian President Vladimir Putin instead. We believe in strong alliances and will deter Russian aggression, build European resilience, and protect our NATO allies. We will make it clear to Putin that we are prepared to cooperate with him when it is in our interest—as we did on reducing nuclear stockpiles, ensuring Iran could not obtain a nuclear weapon, sanctioning North Korea, and resupplying our troops in Afghanistan—but we will not hesitate to stand up to Russian aggression. We will also continue to stand by the Russian people and push the government to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens.\nCybersecurity and Online Privacy\nDemocrats will protect our industry, infrastructure, and government from cyberattacks. We will strengthen our cybersecurity, seek to establish global norms in cyberspace, and impose consequences on those who violate the rules. We will do this while protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the American people. We will also ensure a coherent strategy across federal agencies by building on the Obama Administration's Cybersecurity National Action Plan, especially the empowerment of a federal Chief Information Security Officer, the modernization of federal information technology, and upgrades to government-wide cybersecurity.\nDemocrats reject the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe. We need liberty and security, and each makes the other possible. We will protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people—standing firm against the type of warrantless surveillance of American citizens that flourished during the Bush Administration. We support recent reforms to government bulk data collection programs so the government is not collecting and holding millions of files on innocent Americans.\nWe will support a national commission on digital security and encryption to bring together technology and public safety communities to address the needs of law enforcement, protect the privacy of Americans, assess how innovation might point to new policy approaches, and advance our larger national security and global competitiveness interests.\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Weapons\nDemocrats are committed to preventing the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and to eventually ridding the planet of these catastrophic weapons. We believe America will be safer in a world with fewer weapons of mass destruction. Donald Trump encourages the spread of nuclear weapons across Asia and the Middle East, which would weaken the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and he is unwilling to rule out using a nuclear weapon against ISIS.\nDemocrats want to reduce the number of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons around the world, as well as their means of delivery, while retaining a strong deterrent as long as others maintain nuclear strike capabilities. We will strengthen the NPT, push for the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and stop the spread of loose nuclear material. Democrats will be informed by a new Nuclear Posture Review in determining continued ways to appropriately shape our nuclear deterrent, with the aim of reducing our reliance on nuclear weapons while meeting our national security obligations. Democrats will also seek new opportunities for further arms control and avoid taking steps that create incentives for the expansion of existing nuclear weapons programs. To this end, we will work to reduce excessive spending on nuclear weapons-related programs that are projected to cost $1 trillion over the next 30 years.\nGlobal Climate Leadership\nClimate change poses an urgent and severe threat to our national security, and Democrats believe it would be a grave mistake for the United States to wait for another nation to take the lead in combating the global climate emergency. According to the military, climate change is a threat multiplier that is already contributing to new conflicts over resources, catastrophic natural disasters, and the degradation of vital ecosystems across the globe. While Donald Trump says that climate change is a \"hoax\" created by and for the Chinese, Democrats recognize the catastrophic consequences facing our country, our planet, and civilization.\nWe believe the United States must lead in forging a robust global solution to the climate crisis. We are committed to a national mobilization, and to leading a global effort to mobilize nations to address this threat on a scale not seen since World War II. In the first 100 days of the next administration, the President will convene a summit of the world's best engineers, climate scientists, policy experts, activists, and indigenous communities to chart a course to solve the climate crisis. Our generation must lead the fight against climate change and we applaud President Obama's leadership in forging the historic Paris climate change agreement. We will not only meet the goals we set in Paris, we will seek to exceed them and push other countries to do the same by slashing carbon pollution and rapidly driving down emissions of potent greenhouse gases like hydrofluorocarbons. We will support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases, deploy more clean energy, and invest in climate resilience and adaptation.\nAs a proud Arctic nation, we are against putting the region at risk through drilling in the Arctic Ocean or the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Instead, while protecting our strategic interests, we will seek collaborative, science-based approaches to be good stewards of the rapidly changing Arctic region.\nProtect Our Values\nOur values of inclusion and tolerance inspire hope around the world and make us safer at home. The world will be more secure, stable, and peaceful when all people are able to reach their God-given potential and live in freedom and dignity. We strive to ensure that the values upon which our country was built, including our belief that all people are created equal, are reflected in everything our nation does. That is why we will promote peacebuilding, protect democracy, and champion human rights defenders. And we will seek to safeguard vulnerable minorities, including LGBT people and people with disabilities.\nWomen and Girls\nWe believe the United States must continue to be a strong advocate for the rights and opportunities of women and girls around the world. Elevating their status is not just the right thing to do—it is also a strategic imperative that advances American interests in prosperity and stability. When women and girls are healthy, educated, and able to participate economically, their families and communities prosper, poverty decreases, and economies grow. And when women participate in conflict resolution and post-conflict processes, it improves the likelihood of securing sustainable peace. Democrats are committed to advancing the rights and opportunities of women and girls as a central focus of American diplomacy, development, and defense efforts and will continue to support the United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. We will work to end the epidemic of gender-based violence around the world. We will urge ratification of the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\nWe will support sexual and reproductive health and rights around the globe. In addition to expanding the availability of affordable family planning information and contraceptive supplies, we believe that safe abortion must be part of comprehensive maternal and women's health care and included as part of America's global health programming. Therefore, we support the repeal of harmful restrictions that obstruct women's access to health care information and services, including the \"global gag rule\" and the Helms Amendment that bars American assistance to provide safe, legal abortion throughout the developing world.\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People\nDemocrats believe that LGBT rights are human rights and that American foreign policy should advance the ability of all persons to live with dignity, security, and respect, regardless of who they are or who they love. We applaud President Obama's historic Presidential Memorandum on International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Persons, which combats criminalization, protects refugees, and provides foreign assistance. We will continue to stand with LGBT people around the world, including fighting efforts by any nation to infringe on LGBT rights or ignore abuse.\nTrafficking and Modern Slavery\nWe will stop the scourge of human trafficking and modern slavery of men, women, boys, and girls. We will use the full force of the law against those who engage in modern-day forms of slavery, including the commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor of men, women, and children. Building on the accomplishments of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, we call for increased diplomatic efforts with foreign governments to root out complicit public officials who facilitate or perpetrate this evil. We will also work to increase the provision of services and protections for trafficking survivors.\nYoung People\nThe majority of the developing world is under the age of 30. These countries will be more prosperous and stable if young people have access to education and employment opportunities. Democrats will promote the rights of young people and nurture young leaders. We will work with people around the world who seek greater opportunities, including by promoting job creation, expanding education and health care, and fostering partnerships between peoples.\nReligious Minorities\nWe are horrified by ISIS' genocide and sexual enslavement of Christians and Yezidis and crimes against humanity against Muslims and others in the Middle East. We will do everything we can to protect religious minorities and the fundamental right of freedom of religion.\nRefugees\nThe world is experiencing a major refugee crisis with more than 60 million people displaced as a result of conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. We support President Obama's call for an international summit to address this crisis so that every country assumes its responsibility to meet this humanitarian challenge. While Donald Trump proposes banning Muslim refugees, we will look for ways to help innocent people who are fleeing persecution while ensuring rigorous screening and vetting.\nCivil Society\nDemocrats support progress toward more accountable governance and universal rights. As autocrats and strongmen around the world crack down on civil society and imprison those who speak out to demand greater freedom, we will continue to bolster groups and individuals who fight for fundamental human rights, democracy, and rule of law. We will support strong legislatures, independent judiciaries, free press, vibrant civil society, honest police forces, religious freedom, and equality for women and minorities. We will bolster the development of civil society and representative institutions that can protect fundamental human rights and improve the quality of life for all citizens, including independent and democratic unions. In non-democratic countries, we will work with international partners to assist the efforts of those struggling to promote peaceful political reforms.\nDemocrats will protect Americans citizens abroad. We condemn the practice of unlawful detentions or imprisonment, especially of journalists and civil rights activists.\nAnti-Corruption\nDemocrats believe that we need to end corruption worldwide and increase transparency. We will fight corruption, promote good governance, and support the rule of law. We will also seek to close offshore tax havens, which corrupt rulers, individuals, and corporations exploit to shelter ill-gotten gains or avoid paying taxes at home.\nTorture\nWe will always seek to uphold our values at home and abroad, not just when it is easy, but when it is hard. That is why President Obama banned torture without exception in his first week in office and why Democrats condemn Donald Trump's statements that he would engage in torture and other war crimes. We agree with military and national security experts who acknowledge that torture is not an effective interrogation technique.\nClosing Guantánamo Bay\nThe Democratic Party remains committed to closing the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay and ending indefinite detention without trial or conviction. Keeping the facility open is a blemish on our record, serves as a recruiting tool for extremists, and undermines our standing in the world.\nDevelopment Assistance\nWe believe that development assistance is an essential instrument of American power. It can prevent threats, enhance stability, and reduce the need for military force. With less than one percent of the federal budget, our development assistance has helped cut extreme poverty in half, drastically decreased maternal and child mortality, reduced global hunger, provided food security, countered deadly pandemics, promoted education, and put an AIDS-free generation within reach. This investment reflects the best of America and makes us safer. We need to continue this work and make more progress on important global goals like ending extreme poverty and hunger.\nWe will support local development efforts, recognizing the self-determination of the peoples and countries we assist to direct their own futures. We will also learn from recent conflicts to improve civilian capacity for conflict prevention and stabilization.\nGlobal Health\nAmerica has made critical investments in global health, including in the areas of maternal and child health, HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. It is vital that we continue this work— which has saved millions of lives around the world and is essential to our nation's health security. While the Republican Party refuses to fund important measures that could contain and address the Zika pandemic, Democrats are ready to limit the reach of Zika—just as we did with Ebola—and support funding for diagnostic tests for the virus, vaccine, and treatment. We will also prepare for potential pandemics, like avian influenza and H1N1, by working with first responders and health officials to reduce the risks associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious diseases.\nHIV and AIDS\nDemocrats believe an AIDS-free generation is within our grasp. But today far too many Americans living with HIV are without access to quality care and too many new infections occur each year. That is why we will implement the National HIV and AIDS Strategy; increase research funding for the National Institutes of Health; cap pharmaceutical expenses for people living with HIV and AIDS; reform HIV criminalization laws; and expand access for harm reduction programs and HIV prevention medications, particularly for the populations most at risk of infection. Abroad, we will continue our commitment to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and increase global funding for HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment. Democrats will always protect those living with HIV and AIDS from stigma and discrimination.\nInternational Labor\nDemocrats believe that a key element of American leadership is growing our economy and protecting American jobs. We also believe that the world will be safer when there is greater prosperity. That is why we will prioritize and strongly enforce provisions on decent work and worker's rights in all American diplomatic, trade, and programmatic efforts. We think it is wrong for workers in the United States to have to compete against poverty-wage, child, or slave labor.\nDemocrats will fight to end child labor. We will promote broad-based economic growth across the world, pursuing a global economic agenda that promotes rising wages and invests in quality public services, workers' rights, and environmental protections. We believe that we need to coordinate our economic actions with other countries to address economic insecurity, specifically youth un- and underemployment, gender inequality, the digital transformation, and the transition towards green jobs.\nA Leader in the World\nAmerican leadership is essential to keeping us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. It would be a dangerous mistake for America to abandon our responsibilities. We cannot, as Donald Trump suggests, cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to others who will not have our best interests in mind.\nAsia-Pacific\nFrom the Asia Pacific to the Indian Ocean, we will deepen our relationships in the region with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. We will honor our historic commitment to Japan. We will continue to invest in a long-term strategic partnership with India—the world's largest democracy, a nation of great diversity, and an important Pacific power. We will build on the historic opening with Burma and advocate for greater human rights protections and national reconciliation among Burma's many different ethnic groups. We will help Pakistan stabilize its polity and build an effective relationship with the predominantly young population of this strategically located, nuclear-armed country. We will also work with our allies and partners to fortify regional institutions and norms as well as protect freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.\nDemocrats will push back against North Korean aggression and press China to play by the rules. We will stand up to Beijing on unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, censorship of the internet, piracy, and cyberattacks. And we will look for areas of cooperation, including on combatting climate change and nuclear proliferation. We will promote greater respect for human rights, including the rights of Tibetans. We are committed to a \"One China\" policy and the Taiwan Relations Act and will continue to support a peaceful resolution of Cross-Strait issues that is consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan.\nMiddle East\nIn the Middle East, Democrats will push for more inclusive governance in Iraq and Syria that respects the equal rights of all citizens; provide support and security for Lebanon and Jordan, two countries that are hosting a disproportionate number of refugees; maintain our robust security cooperation with Gulf countries; and stand by the people of the region as they seek greater economic opportunity and freedom. A strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States because we share overarching strategic interests and the common values of democracy, equality, tolerance, and pluralism. That is why we will always support Israel's right to defend itself, including by retaining its qualitative military edge, and oppose any effort to delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations or through the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement.\nWe will continue to work toward a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict negotiated directly by the parties that guarantees Israel's future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity. While Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. Israelis deserve security, recognition, and a normal life free from terror and incitement. Palestinians should be free to govern themselves in their own viable state, in peace and dignity.\nEurope\nEurope remains America's indispensable partner and a cornerstone of global security. Democrats will stand with our European allies and partners to deter Russian aggression, address security challenges to Europe's south, and deal with unprecedented economic and social challenges. We will maintain our steadfast commitment to the special relationship with United Kingdom and the transatlantic partnership with the European Union. We will seek to strengthen our strategic partnership with Turkey while pushing for reforms, end the division of Cyprus, and continue to support a close relationship with states that seek to strengthen their ties to NATO and Europe, such as Georgia and Ukraine.\nWe reject Donald Trump's threats to abandon our European and NATO allies, all while he praises Putin. When the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001, our NATO allies invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, stating that an attack against one is an attack against all—for the first and only time in its history. Our NATO allies fought alongside us in Afghanistan and are still there today. We will maintain our Article 5 collective security commitments to NATO because we are stronger when we have our allies at our side. And we will continue to push NATO members to contribute their fair share.\nAmericas\nThe Americas are a region of singular strategic, economic, and cultural importance and opportunity for the United States. Democrats reject Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall on our southern border and alienate Mexico, a valuable partner. We will instead embrace our neighbors and pursue strong, fruitful partnerships across the region, from Canada to Latin America and the Caribbean. We will bolster democratic institutions, promote economic opportunity and prosperity, and tackle the rise of drugs, transnational crime, and corruption. We will strengthen the U.S.- Caribbean regional relationship through economic development and comprehensive immigration reform. And we will build on our long-term commitment to Colombia and work with Central American countries to stabilize the Northern Triangle.\nIn Cuba, we will build on President Obama's historic opening and end the travel ban and embargo. We will also stand by the Cuban people and support their ability to decide their own future and to enjoy the same human rights and freedoms that people everywhere deserve. In Venezuela, we will push the government to respect human rights and respond to the will of its people. And in Haiti, we will support local and international efforts to bolster the country's democratic institutions and economic development. We will also help more Haitians take advantage of Temporary Protected Status. Finally, we will close the School of the Americas, now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, because we believe that military and police forces should support democracy, not subvert it.\nAfrica\nAfrica is home to many of the fastest growing economies in the world. Democrats will strengthen our partnership and collaboration with the African Union, emphasizing trade while increasing development assistance to bolster the continent's domestic economies. We will engage our African partners on the full range of global challenges and opportunities, and we will continue to strengthen democratic institutions and human rights, fair trade and investment, development, and global health. We will help our African partners improve their capacity to respond to crises and protect citizens, especially women and girls. And we will work to end the reign of terror promulgated by Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, AQIM, and ISIS.\nDemocrats applaud President Obama's National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, and his commitment to preserving the earth's natural beauty for future generations. Democrats support science-based management of iconic wildlife in Africa, including stronger regulations banning the importation into the United States of hunting trophies that are not supported by current science-based evidence and are related to or funded by non-scientific special interests.\nGlobal Economy and Institutions\nDemocrats will protect and grow the global economy. While Donald Trump wants to default on our debt, which would lead to a disastrous global economic crisis, we believe we must be responsible stewards and work with our partners to prevent another worldwide financial crisis.\nDemocrats believe that global institutions—most prominently the United Nations—and multilateral organizations have a powerful role to play and are an important amplifier of American strength and influence. Many of these organizations need reform and updating, but it would be reckless to follow Donald Trump and turn our back on the international system that our country built. It has provided decades of stability and economic growth for the world and for America.", "timestamp": "2016-07-21", "title": "2016 Democratic Party Platform"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117935", "text": "Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\nI have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end.\nBeginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\nThese are the facts:\nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.\nHomicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.\nIn the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\nI've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?\nAgain, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.\nThe budget is no better.\nPresident Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.\nThis was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.\nIn Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.\nLet's defeat her in November, OK.\nI am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.\nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.\nAfter four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve.\nThe American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\nThat is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\nI have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\nI am your voice!\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.\n[disruption in the audience]\nHow great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\nWhen innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was \"extremely careless\" and \"negligent,\" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.\nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me.\nI will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.\nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.\nThis Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.\nWhen I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.\nTo make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.\nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and we're going to stop it.\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me.\nAnd as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\nWe must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\nRecently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.\nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.\nOn January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.\nBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.\nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.\nNever, ever again.\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.\nShe supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.\nNo longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.\nThis includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.\nWe are going to start building and making things again.\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\nThis new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!\nThank you. Thank you.\nWe are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.\nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.\nWe will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.\nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.\nWe are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\nThe replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.\nIt's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\nThen there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.\nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\nRemember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\nHistory is watching us now.\nIt's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her\". I choose to recite a different pledge.\nMy pledge reads: \"I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\"\nI am your voice.\nSo to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTo all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nGod bless you, and good night! I love you!", "timestamp": "2016-07-21", "title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118033", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n10:22 A.M. EDT\nQ: Let's see the socks.\nMR. EARNEST: Want to see the socks?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: All right. Got the socks on, man. (Laughter.) All right, now that we've got the socks out of the way -- (laughter) -- good morning, everybody. Knowing of your intense interest in covering the visit of the World Series Champion Kansas City Royals -- (applause) --\nQ: Our intense interest? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: -- we thought we would get the briefing out of the way so that then you could focus on what I'm sure is the big news story at the White House today.\nQ: Clarify news interest today. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Exactly. Exactly.\nListen, before we get started with questions I'll just do one other thing. There's another reason, another significant thing about today that warrants mentioning. Today marks the sixth anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This is a piece of legislation that the President strongly supported, and it's primarily because of the President's belief that never again should taxpayers be on the hook for bailing out the economy because of bad debts that are made by Wall Street bankers.\nThat is why you've seen the President vigorously defend Wall Street reform from attempts by Republicans in Congress to roll back these critical financial and consumer protections. And six years later, we've seen significant progress on behalf of taxpayers in terms of making our financial system stronger and more accountable.\nLet me just give you a couple of statistics. Over the last seven years, banks have added more than $700 billion of additional capital and can now withstand severe losses while still supporting the real economy. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created as a part of this bill, has put $11.7 billion in the pockets of more than 27 million consumers who've been harmed. That's $6.4 million for every single day that that agency has been in existence. The $600 trillion derivatives market has been brought out of the shadows with additional requirements that ensure transparency in the market.\nAnd contrary to the predictions of the critics of Wall Street reform, we have succeeded both in strengthening the U.S. financial system and presiding over the recovery and expansion of the U.S. economy. Businesses in this time have created nearly 15 million new jobs. A family's wealth has grown by $30 trillion, exceeding pre-crisis levels. Average hourly earnings for private employees have increased 2.6 percent over the last 12 months. Foreclosure rates have dropped all the way back to pre-crisis levels, and business lending has climbed over 60 percent.\nIn other words, we have succeeded both in making the financial system more stable, even as our economy has essentially become the envy of the world. And there was a lot of skepticism that these kinds of tough reforms would have a negative impact on the economy. And the President, and the strategy that we have pursued with the strong support of Democrats, has actually proved those critics wrong. We've been able to do both. And it's American taxpayers and American workers who benefit the most.\nSo this is certainly -- when we talk about the President's legacy, this is not the first thing that comes to mind, but the successful implementation of Wall Street reform, particularly in the aftermath of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, is certainly an important part of I think what historians will assess about the Obama presidency.\nSo with that, Darlene, let's go to your questions.\nMR. YOST: Excuse me.\nMR. EARNEST: Uh-oh, you guys. Look out. (Kansas City Royals manager and ballplayers come out.)\nMR. YOST: We had real fears that Josh would get in trouble by hijacking the President's jersey, so we made a special one for him. (Laughter.)\nQ: Oooh --\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, wow! Look at that! Thank you, Ned. I really appreciate it. Look at this! Hey, Salvy how are you? Very nice to see you. Thank you.\nMR. HOSMER: Here's a mug for you.\nMR. EARNEST: That is a big mug. (Laughter.) I don't think it will fit underneath the desk. Thank you, guys. Welcome to the White House.\nMR. YOST: Thank you. We're excited to be here.\nMR. EARNEST: So glad that you're here. I know the President is looking forward to it, too.\nMR. YOST: So are we.\nMR. EARNEST: And this is a celebration worthy of a World Championship.\nMR. YOST: Sorry we interrupted. We know you have to work.\nMR. EARNEST: That's all right. You're welcome here any time. Nice to see you guys. Hopefully we'll see you later.\nThank you, Salvy. Nice to see you.\nMR. PEREZ: Nice to see you, Josh. Back to work.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if this is going to fit underneath the podium here. (Laughter.)\nQ: Are you going to put it on?\nMR. EARNEST: Course I am. Look at this! That's pretty cool right there. That's pretty good. All right.\nQ: Is that your first one?\nMR. EARNEST: This is my first one, right here. I'm going to have to wear that this afternoon. (Laughter.) All right.\nQ: How do you top that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I have no idea. (Laughter.) Back to Dodd-Frank. Yes. Yes. Where were we?\nQ: I wanted to ask what is the reaction from the White House to Donald Trump when he says that the U.S. may not come to the aid of the Baltic States if they're attacked by Russia unless they fulfill their obligations to both the U.S. and NATO?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, there's obviously been a lot of discussion and debate and churn about the agenda being put forward and the rhetoric being used by the Republican nominee. I'll let other people weigh in on that. Let me just be really clear about the policy that this President has pursued, which is a steadfast commitment to our NATO alliance. The cornerstone of that alliance is a pledge that all of the allies have made to mutual self-defense. The U.S. commitment to that pledge is ironclad. The President renewed that commitment just two weeks ago today, when he traveled to Warsaw, Poland, to attend the NATO Summit.\nOver the course of this presidency, one of the President's priorities has been solidifying the transatlantic alliance and strengthening the transatlantic alliance, in some cases, even expanding it. And NATO welcomed a new member, Montenegro, at this most recent summit.\nIt's also important I think to recognize that the recognition that NATO is the cornerstone of American national security is a policy that the United States has pursued under every post-World War II President, Democrat and Republican. So this is a longstanding commitment that has been strengthened under the leadership of President Obama. And there should be no mistake or miscalculation made about this country's commitment to our transatlantic alliance.\nQ: Secondly, I wanted to ask about Turkey. They are moving there toward imposing a three-month state of emergency after the coup. There have been a lot of mass arrests, school closures. The deputy prime minister there says his country is also moving to suspend the European Human Rights Convention. How alarmed is the White House by some of what's going on in Turkey? And also, the Germans today said -- seemed to suggest that a three-month state of emergency was not necessary, that it could be shorter than that. Does the White House think three months is too much time? Or do you have an opinion on the length of the state of emergency?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific reaction to the length of time that's been announced by the Turkish government. What the President made clear in his telephone call with President Erdogan is that Turkey succeeded in fighting off the military coup because of the strength of that country and those citizens to democracy. Turkey has a long tradition of democracy. These are principles that are enshrined in their constitution. And even in this time of turmoil, it's important for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey to protect them.\nNow, at the same time, less than a week ago, some elements of the Turkish military launched attacks against those democratic institutions that resulted in significant loss of life. So it's certainly understandable that President Erdogan and other government officials are going to take steps to get to the bottom of what happened. The Turkish people have an interest in accountability, particular for those individuals who conspired to attack the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.\nBut it's important, moving forward, that the democratic institutions that were critical to the success in repelling the coup emerge stronger than ever.\nAnd the President made that clear in his telephone call to President Erdogan even as the Turkish government pursued an investigation into what happened. The United States stands ready to assist them and we remain committed to the stability and success of our NATO allies.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, following up on Turkey. The Turkish government has also said there will not be a return to the deep repression of the past, despite this three-month state of emergency. Is the United States confident that that is, in fact, the case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the President indicated that we're going to continue to monitor this situation closely. And U.S. officials will continue to be in close touch with their Turkish counterparts to signal our support for their efforts to investigate this coup, and to bring full accountability to those individuals who may have been involved in trying to overthrow this civilian democratic government.\nBut at the same time, we're going to continue to urge them to protect the kinds of democratic traditions and institutions that helped them repel the coup in the first place and are critical to Turkey's success in the future. These are institutions that have strong support among the Turkish people. I think the best evidence I have for that is something I mentioned yesterday, which is that as the coup -- the attempted coup was starting, there were strong statements from all of the political parties represented in the Turkish parliament condemning the coup. Those statements included an unambiguous message from the political parties that have vigorous political disagreements with President Erdogan and his government.\nSo there is a commitment to the democratic process in Turkey. And that is a tradition and a set of rights and a process that's worth investing in and worth protecting.\nQ: In order to start talks to join the European Union, Turkey had to abolish the death penalty. Now that -- the Turkish government has said it's considering bringing that back to deal with plotters of the coup. The United States obviously has the death penalty, which makes it a little tougher perhaps to comment on this, but does the White House have any concerns about the consideration of bringing back that penalty in response to this crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States is not going to micromanage the situation in Turkey, but I think we are going to send a clear, unmistakable signal of support for the democratic institutions of Turkey, support for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey, and continue to encourage that democratic government to rely on due process, democratic institutions, and rights that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution.\nQ: So what's your thought about them bringing back the death penalty?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific reaction to that. Obviously, the Turkish government and President Erdogan are going to have some decisions to make about how to proceed, and as they do, the international community will be closely watching. And their desire for accountability as it relates to the failed coup is certainly understandable. And at the same time, I think it's arguably been as important as it's ever been for the Turkish government to demonstrate their continued, clear commitment to a set of democratic traditions and principles that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution.\nQ: Lastly, Josh, on another subject. The President has established strong ties with Malaysia and its Prime Minister during his time in office. Is the White House concerned that these lawsuits to recuperate $1 billion stolen from the development fund might affect the diplomatic relationship between our two countries?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, what you're referring to is a Department of Justice action and an enforcement action that was taken independent of influence from anywhere else in the executive branch. This certainly is something that was conducted pursuant to U.S. law, again, without any influence from the White House. So as it relates to that action and any sort of ongoing investigation, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.\nMore generally, the President discussed this broader situation -- not the specific Department of Justice investigation -- but addressed the reports with the public and with Prime Minister Najib when he was in Malaysia last fall. And the President reiterated how important it is, particularly for a fast-growing country like Malaysia, to be transparent, to demonstrate a commitment to fair play and good government and a business climate that will allow that country's economy to continue to succeed. And for business interests who are considering doing business in Malaysia, they're going to be looking for signs that there's a good business climate in Malaysia.\nAnd the government should be conspicuous about making clear that they're committed to transparency and good governance and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in Malaysia's fast-growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly. But ultimately it will be the responsibility of the Malaysian government to address the concerns that have been raised, and that's something that the President has been saying, dating back to his visit to Malaysia last year.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple days ago, you mentioned that the Turkish government had transmitted some information to the U.S. government in relation to the cleric in Pennsylvania who they believe has been sort of responsible for this coup attempt. I'm wondering if, having looked over that information, you believe that that is an extradition request and if you've seen any evidence to back up what the Turkish government has said so far.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, as I indicated earlier this week, the United States Department of Justice and the State Department intend to be responsive to requests from their Turkish counterparts. That includes reviewing relevant materials that are provided by the Turkish government and doing so consistent with the terms of the longstanding extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey, and consistent with the principles enshrined in U.S. law.\nI'm not going to be able to provide a daily update on the progress of those interactions between U.S. Justice officials and their Turkish counterparts. But I can assure you that that interaction and that engagement is ongoing. And all of the decisions that are made as a part of the process will not be dictated by the President because this is not a presidential decision. The outcomes will be dictated by the terms of the extradition treaty between our two countries and due process that individuals who live in the United States are allowed to -- that are protected by.\nQ: With relation to the three-month state of emergency, are you saying that the U.S. has no concerns that the state of emergency -- which will allow for crackdowns on freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, sort of doing an end run around the parliament there -- do you think there are no concerns that this could undermine the democratic institutions of Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm saying, Toluse, is that the United States government will be closely monitoring the situation in Turkey, and we're going to continue to urge the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey to abide by the democratic traditions that the people of that country cherish. The Turkish government has democratic institutions that are worth protecting. The rights that are enshrined in the Turkish constitution are worth protecting. And we'll continue to make that clear to the Turkish government, even as they conduct an investigation to determine who was behind the military plot to overthrow the democratic government of Turkey.\nQ: And if they decide that after you've made it clear -- and you've been making it clear for several months that every time the President talks to President Erdogan he does bring these things up -- so if they decide that they were going to go forward with these crackdowns anyway, is there anything that the U.S. plans to do differently?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. Obviously our views on this topic have been made clear both publicly and privately, including at the highest levels. And so we're going to continue to monitor the situation in Turkey moving forward. U.S. officials, particularly at the Department of Justice and the Department of State, will continue to engage with their Turkish counterparts. And the United States is going to be continue to be unequivocal about our strong support for Turkey's democratic institutions, for Turkey's democratic traditions, and for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.\nQ: And then one more. In the interview with The New York Times, Donald Trump said that the U.S. doesn't have a right to sort of lecture other countries because we need to fix our own mess when it comes to things like police shootings or what's happened in Dallas or Baton Rouge. How do respond to that idea, that the U.S. -- in a sort of criticism that other countries have made as well -- that the U.S. shouldn't tell other countries how to manage their internal issues because we have our own problems to deal with as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, this is not a controversial notion. The President of the United States has a responsibility to advocate around the world for America's interests and for our values. And that's certainly what President Obama has done. And the President makes that case not because the United States is perfect, but because the United States continually strives to be perfect. Our goal is to form a more perfect union. And even when there are instances where we fall short, the American people and the U.S. government are committed to righting those wrongs, to addressing those shortcomings, and living up to the high standard that we've set for ourselves. That is what gives the President of the United States the moral authority to go and make our case to countries around the world that they should try to do the same thing.\nSo the President has made this case on many occasions, including even before the United Nations General Assembly, on more than one occasion. So the President has certainly spoken to this. The irony is, is that occasionally there have been Republicans who have suggested that when the President makes this point, that he's somehow engaged in a global apology tour. That is a notion that has been thoroughly debunked. But I guess it makes it a little ironic that -- I guess it means that there's some ironies associated with the case that's being made by the Republican nominee at this point.\nBut the case that the President has made is one that is rooted in the exceptional nature of the country that he leads. And the exceptional nature of this country is that we have set a very high standard when it comes to our values and our commitment to a set of universal human rights, and we never stop and we never tire of striving to live up to that high standard. And that certainly is what we encourage other countries around the world to do.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you give me sort of a readout on what we should expect from the President's conversations with the Mexican leadership tomorrow? And specifically, is the President satisfied in the job that they've done in terms of human trafficking and drug trafficking interdiction at all along the U.S.-Mexican border?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, you'll have an opportunity to hear from the two Presidents tomorrow after their meeting, so you'll be able to get a detailed assessment of their conversation. But let me give you a sense of what's on the President's mind as he prepares to meet with his Mexican counterpart tomorrow.\nI would anticipate that the two leaders will spend some time talking about the trade relationship between our two countries. Both the United States and Mexico are signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The President is quite enthusiastic about this deal because it would represent an upgrade on NAFTA. For the first time, it would make enforceable higher labor and environmental standards that will create a more level playing field for American workers and American businesses that has the potential to expand economic opportunity here in the United States and give more U.S. companies an opportunity to grow not just here in the United States, but around the world, including with neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico that are signatories to the agreement.\nIn addition to that, the United States has found Mexico to be an effective partner on fighting climate change. And I would anticipate that they will continue to discuss additional efforts that both our countries can take in that effort. Obviously there was a significant announcement that was made at the North American Leaders Summit in Canada last month, and there will be a continued discussion of those commitments.\nAnd there certainly will be a discussion about border security, and fighting narco-trafficking. We have made progress in that effort over the last couple of years, in part because our cooperation with the Mexican government has improved. And it will require effective cooperation between the United States and Mexico to crack down on criminal elements -- transnational criminal elements, including those that are focused on narco-trafficking or human trafficking. Our effective cooperation will allow us to bring an end to those organizations that create so much criminal activity and have such a negative impact on communities on both sides of the border.\nI should note, under President Obama's leadership, the United States government has made a historic investment in border security along the U.S.-Mexico border. In terms of technology, in terms of infrastructure and in terms of staffing, there's never been a great commitment to border security. And that's reflected in the numbers that we see of individuals who are apprehended attempting to cross the border. Those numbers are lower than they've been in a generation. And that's a testament to the efforts that we have made under President Obama to strengthen our border security.\nPart of that strategy includes effective coordination with the Mexican government. We certainly have enjoyed that effective cooperation with President Peсa Nieto, and their conversations tomorrow will include a discussion about how to deepen that cooperation.\nQ: Are remittances on the agenda, do you imagine, Josh, in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if that will come up in their meeting tomorrow, but once that conversation has occurred, we'll try to give you a more detailed readout.\nQ: Okay, good. Merrick Garland -- what's the very latest on the Chief Judge? And what, if anything, will be happening in the weeks during the break?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've reached an unfortunate milestone, as I noted earlier this week, that Chief Judge Garland has now gone longer without a hearing than any other Supreme Court nominee in history that wasn't later withdrawn. And that's rather unfortunate when you consider that Chief Judge Garland has another distinction, which is that he is arguably the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history. He has served more years on the federal bench than any other individual who's ever been nominated for the Supreme Court.\nWhen you couple that with the highest possible rating that he received from the nonpartisan ABA and from the clear assessment of Republican senators, including Orrin Hatch, who described him as a unanimous -- or a consensus nominee, I think that's an indication that he's not being treated fairly by Republicans. I think it's a clear indication that Republicans are not doing their job. And that's unfortunate.\nBut the President is committed to his pick, and we're going to make a strong case both in public and in private that the senators should do their job and that they should confirm Chief Judge Garland to an appointment on the Supreme Court. Because the President is confident that he will serve this country with honor and distinction in that role.\nQ: So, no change or no plans that the President would have of withdrawing that nomination? And has Chief Judge Garland made any comments about the process to the President or the White House about wanting to maybe step away?\nMR. EARNEST: No, there is no chance that President Obama will withdraw his nominee to the Supreme Court, Chief Judge Merrick Garland. And the President and his team, including Chief Judge Garland, remain 100 percent committed to seeing through his nomination and seeing it result in his appointment to the Supreme Court.\nQ: Last one for me. An interesting dustup on Twitter over the last several days finds a famed blogger who's now been banned from Twitter for inciting -- it has been alleged -- inciting hate speech. What does the White House think about the balance of free speech versus, for lack of a better description, inciteful speech? And is that a good idea that services like Twitter remove people from their service because of it? And I ask that question also because we've had the conversation previously, you and I, about these hate groups overseas, or these ISIS-sympathetic groups in particular.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, all of these kinds of questions raise important First Amendment considerations. And the United States government and President Obama and the Obama administration are I think quite obviously strongly committed to First Amendment protections.\nAt the same time, social media companies like Twitter have to make their own decisions and set their own policies for the use of their technology. And obviously the U.S. government has been able to work effectively with these social media companies in many instances to combat individuals who might try to capitalize on this technology to propagate a hateful ideology and inspire people to carry out acts of violence.\nI think what's also true with Twitter is they recognize that having some rules of the roads, some terms of use, allows for a more effective tool. People are more likely to use this social medial tool to connect with their friends or other people around the world if they know they're not going to be subjected to a stream of hate every time they log on.\nSo the considerations that Twitter and other social media companies have to make are different than the kind of considerations that the U.S. government has to make. We've got a commitment to protecting people's First Amendment rights. Twitter has a commitment to their users and to their customers in fostering an environment that makes people feel comfortable enough to use it.\nSo I'm certainly not going to second-guess any of the steps that Twitter or any other social media company has to make in this regard. But obviously these are the kinds of challenging questions that have significant consequences that innovators have to make, and certainly Twitter is among them.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, on the timing of the Mexican President's visit, can you comment on whether there was an eye towards politics on that, given that he will be visiting and speaking to the press a day after we hear the Republican nominee, whose prime foreign policy platform is about building a wall with this country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think all of you have made conclusions about the starkly different approach that President Obama has taken to a wide range of issues than the agenda that's being put forward by the Republican nominee. So I think it's fair to say that almost anything that President Obama did on Friday would be viewed as a sharp contrast to the agenda that's being put forward by the other side.\nBut in this case, it's been a while since the President has hosted the President of Mexico here at White House. And they had an opportunity to discuss a range of issues in Canada last month. The President felt it was an important opportunity to continue those conversations here at the White House later this week, and the President is certainly looking forward to that visit and he's looking forward to a constructive conversation with our friends in Mexico.\nQ: And, I'm sure, looking forward to the chance to speak about something -- you're also giving the Mexican President a platform to speak for himself in the wake of what we can only anticipate are disparaging comments about the issue of illegal immigration to this country from his. Is that not part of your consideration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, it is not at all uncommon, as you know, for the President to host a news conference when the head of a state of a significant U.S. ally is at the White House. This is not an unusual occurrence. And I don't know exactly how President Peсa Nieto plans to address the question about the Republican nominee. But presumably, one of you will ask him and give him the opportunity to do so. We'll see what he says.\nQ: The Republican nominee made some comments about also withdrawing from NAFTA very, very quickly. You we're talking up TPP as really being an upgrade to that trade deal.\nMR. EARNEST: It is.\nQ: In calling it an upgrade, are you saying that there is a need for some improvement on the terms of NAFTA?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let the Republican nominee speak for himself. President Obama, when he was campaigning for this job back in 2008, included a promise to renegotiate NAFTA. And the President made good on that promise. And what he had in mind was raising the standards that were included in the agreement. And what we've been able to do in the context of the TPP agreement that's quite significant is to not just raise those standards but to make them enforceable inside the context of the agreement.\nAnd that should give American workers and American businesses confidence that this agreement will actually succeed in leveling that playing field in a way that will have important benefits for American workers and American businesses. The President continues to be confident that if American companies and American workers are given a fair chance to succeed and compete in the 21st century global economy that they're going to win more often than not. And that's among the reasons the President has made the Trans-Pacific Partnership a genuine priority.\nQ: On NATO, when we were in Warsaw with the President, he made a point of saying only five countries pay their fair share -- that includes the U.S. -- of their dues to NATO. Does the President think he has been forceful enough in urging allies -- very close ones, Canada among them -- to pay up when they're not? That is at the heart of what the criticism is from the Republican nominee that perhaps there hasn't been enough pressure put on NATO members to pay up. And the President himself has said he's irritated by that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has made clear that it's important for our allies to pay their fair share, and they need to make that a priority. The President also is aware that he is making that argument in the context of a European economy that is not as strong as we'd like. So the President is understanding of the cross-pressures here, but it's important not to take the NATO alliance for granted.\nAnd one significant achievement of the NATO summit that was convened in Wales two years ago -- and this is an initiative that was not just prioritized by the British government that was hosts of the summit, but also prioritized by the U.S. government -- was to secure a commitment from all of the NATO allies that they would work toward sufficient defense funding over the 10-year budget window.\nAnd there was a commitment on the part of all the allies to work toward ensuring that by 2024, 10 years after signing the agreement, that all of the NATO allies would be committing 2 percent of their GDP to defense spending. And that would make sure that all of the allies were doing their fair share and prepared to contribute to meeting the defense commitments that are enshrined in the NATO alliance.\nSo the President has been forceful in making this argument and we have secured specific commitments as a result of the President making that argument in a way that will enhance not just the strength of NATO but also the national security of the United States.\nHans.\nQ: Josh, you've noted the irony of the President being accused of something that the Republicans accused him of a global apology tour, and what Trump is sort of advocating -- does the President share your sense of irony?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the President speak for himself in terms of his observations about that --\nQ: We wanted to get on TV today. Does he share a sense of irony now? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there's plenty of footage that you have of the President talking about the presidential race. But I don't have any desire to be on television today to talk about the presidential race.\nPam.\nQ: On the financial reform issue, Josh, you've said in the past that the penalties for the banks that created the whole mess in the first place were really being the punishment rather than people actually going to jail. Have there been enough reforms to set up laws that in the future if something like this happened again people could actually be criminally prosecuted? Because that's one of the complaints, that few, if any, big bank people went to jail.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there have been some complaints. And the observation made by some is that while the highly irresponsible activity on Wall Street that contributed to the Great Recession were actions that were irresponsible but not necessarily illegal. And I think some have made the observation that that's what's made many of those actions very difficult to prosecute.\nAnd there has been some improvement in the clarification and strengthening of some of those laws to make clear and to better align the incentives in a way that's consistent with the broader interest of the economy and the American people. So we've made some progress on that front. I think it's notable -- and we can provide some additional statistics for you about this -- that there are a number of settlements that have been reached by the Department of Justice that did allow taxpayers and homeowners and others who were treated unfairly in this process to recoup some of the money that they lost.\nSo there has been some important work that's been done both by the Treasury Department, by the Department of Justice and other agencies that have jurisdiction. But there certainly is progress included in the Wall Street reform legislation that the President signed six years ago today that will toughen enforcement of these kinds of rules and regulations.\nQ: Some people think that there are still banks that are too big to fail and that they're a risk to the economy. Do you think that that risk is still there despite the reforms?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is confident that because of the way that we have succeeded in implementing Wall Street reform regulations, that we have addressed the problem that was raised in the context of the financial crisis about taxpayers being on the hook for bailing out big banks that make risky bets that go bad. The good news is that there now is a mechanism for regularly reviewing large financial institutions to assess their health and to assess their ability to weather a difficult financial environment, even a financial crisis.\nSo regulatory agencies, not just in the executive branch or not just that are part of the Obama administration, but even independent regulator institutions, now have more authority and greater transparency into the inner workings of these financial institutions and a regular schedule for reviewing them. All of that should be helpful in preventing the kind of crisis that we saw back in 2008.\nQ: And just one quick one on Merrick Garland. When the President announced the nomination, he suggested if the Senate would not give him a hearing that there could be a tit-for-tat kind of situation with Democrats. Given the fact that Garland has waited so long now for a hearing, do you think that possibility is increasing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is clearly true is Republicans have, in unprecedented fashion, politicized the process of confirming a Supreme Court nominee. There's no denying that. Some Republicans have even acknowledged that. Senator Graham acknowledged that what Republicans were doing is unprecedented. And the President is concerned about the impact that has on our system of justice and on the Supreme Court as an institution.\nThat's why he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, basically suggesting that Democrats and Republicans should come together around an idea that was originally put forward by President George W. Bush to establish a timeline for the consideration of obviously qualified Supreme Court nominees. That would at least do a little something to try to walk the Senate back from the brinksmanship that Republicans have engaged in over the last several months. And the President believes that would improve the health of our justice system and give people more confidence that people will be treated in our justice system without regard to their political views or their political affiliation.\nMeghan.\nQ: A couple questions, Josh, on Zika. One, any updates on the situation in Florida? And then, two, one of the comments you made yesterday is that Republicans have the seven weeks of recess to think about the consequences of their failure to deal with the situation. What can you tell us specifically are the consequences at this point? Has the research been slowed? Is there less vector control than there would have been had that $1.9 billion been passed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying as it relates to the situation in Florida, this is obviously something that our public health professionals at the CDC are closely monitoring. Public health professionals in Florida have the responsibility for responding to this particular situation. President Obama called Governor Scott yesterday to assure him that the U.S. government stands ready to offer as much assistance as we possibly can to the state of Florida as they deal with not just this one particular outbreak of the virus but to ensure that we've got the resources -- that we can mobilize resources to help them respond if there are other outbreaks detected.\nBut what's clear is that the U.S. government does not have all the resources available that we would like to use to assist state and local authorities because Congress hasn't acted on a request that President Obama put forward five months ago now. This was a request that was essentially written by our public health professionals that outlined all of the things that they need to do everything possible to protect the country from the Zika virus.\nQ: So are you saying that that $5.6 million that the President guaranteed to Florida yesterday would have been more if the $1.9 billion would have been passed? Or is it ultimately bolstering Republicans' argument that money will be allocated anyway?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly are resources that could be used to help Florida that may not be available right now because the funding isn't there. There are also aspects of the response that are being led by public health professionals that are not operating at full capacity because of the lack of congressional response.\nSo things like lab capacity that would allow diagnostic tests to be processed more quickly and allow diagnostic tests to be more widely available is not at the level that we would like it to be because Congress hasn't appropriated the funding. So that's not something that's just relevant to Florida, that's relevant to states all across the country. Florida is certainly affected by that, but other states are, too.\nThere are additional resources that we would like to be able to make available to states to help them do vector control to fight mosquitoes. So certainly some of the money that the President discussed in his call with Governor Scott could be dedicated to that effort, but presumably Governor Scott or other governors would say, boy, there's more help that we would like to have in terms of hiring more people and getting more equipment to help us fight mosquitoes. But the federal government can't do as much as we would like to do to help those states, again, because Congress hasn't acted.\nQ: And did the President have a chance to watch the First Lady's appearance on \"Carpool Karaoke?\" Any reaction there?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that the President heard about her appearance that was taped a few weeks ago. I don't know if he saw the product that aired last night. I actually have not seen what aired last night. I saw the teaser that they released yesterday, I believe. But it sounds like it must have been interesting.\nQ: It was fun.\nMichelle.\nQ: Josh, for days we've been talking about urging Turkey to exercise restraint. But when you look at the numbers since the coup -- and this is days ago -- there have been more than 9,000 people detained or arrested, 21,000 teachers' licenses suspended, more than 9,000 Ministry of Interior people suspended, 1,500 university deans asked to resign, 2,300 ministry of youth and sports people suspended, 21,000 Ministry of Education people suspended, and then 24 radio and TV licenses revoked. How does that look like restraint in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, the numbers that you've presented are compelling. But what's also compelling are the images that we saw on television of troops being mobilized in tanks rolling through the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, cutting off bridges -- in some cases, even firing shots at the parliament building and other law enforcement institutions. We've got reports that the safety and security of the President of Turkey was threatened based on some actions that were taken by the Turkish military.\nSo the situation in Turkey is serious. And it's understandable that people are feeling on edge. It's also understandable that both the Turkish government and the Turkish people are keenly interested in getting to the bottom of what exactly happened, determining who was responsible, and holding them accountable for attempting to overthrown the democratically elected government of Turkey by force.\nSo given that context, and given the fact that that occurred six days ago, it's understandable that people are on edge. And even as they're on edge, it's important for everybody to understand, including the President of Turkey, that that coup was repelled because of the country's commitment to democracy. And even in these times of turmoil, and even in these times when people are on edge, the democratically elected government of Turkey has a responsibility to protect those democratic institutions and to protect those democratic traditions, because it will make the country stronger because that reflects the will of the Turkish people.\nAnd that's a message that we're not just delivering publicly in settings like this one, it's also a message that President Obama has delivered privately and personally to President Erdogan.\nQ: I mean, nobody is comparing what's going on now with the government -- arresting and suspending people -- to violence and an overthrow of the government. I mean, there's not really a comparison there. But the question is, this is a leader who's recently been called out for consolidating power, cracking down on the press. The question is, is this now going to be his chance to change things politically in ways that maybe he couldn't so broadly before? So does this not raise flags -- because when you're talking about due process, and we're looking at something that's going on six days after a coup, to arrest or fire 50,000 people in the country -- that doesn't look a lot like due process at this point, does it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what it looks like is a situation where people all across the country are quite on edge, and are quite uneasy. And it's why the United States is going to closely monitor the situation moving forward, in part, Michelle, because you make a credible point -- the concerns that we have raised about the importance of protecting democratic institutions in Turkey is something that President Obama has talked about with President Erdogan many times over the last several years.\nAnd again, I cited the example earlier this week of President Erdogan's visit to the United States earlier this year, where there were reports that his security detail was scuffling with independent professional journalists. That certainly is not the kind of relationship that we would expect a democratic leader to have with journalists who are guaranteed certain rights under their country's constitution.\nSo that's why the United States will be monitoring the situation carefully. That's why it should be clear to everyone that even as the United States continues to strongly support the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey, we're also going to strongly encourage the President of Turkey to protect the rights enshrined in the constitution and the democratic institutions that are so critical to the future success of the country.\nQ: That urging doesn't seem to be working, in the last six days.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think given the tumultuous nature of events in Turkey over the last six days, I think the answer is something that we'll learn in the weeks ahead. And that's why we'll be monitoring the situation so closely.\nQ: Okay. And just quickly, yesterday, when the vice presidential possible pick for Secretary Clinton came up, you, kind of on your own, mentioned and then lauded Tim Kaine, without being asked specifically about him. You felt it important to bring up his name. Why did you want to sort of throw his name out there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly did not intend to signal -- and I don't think many of you saw it this way --\nQ: No.\nMR. EARNEST: -- but I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to clarify. I certainly did not intend to signal that the President secretly favors one potential vice presidential candidate over another. I think what's also true is I think you also understood that I wasn't bringing up Tim Kaine's name out of the blue. His name was prominently featured in the news reports we saw yesterday, alongside the other two individuals that I was asked about.\nSo I think the point that I was trying to make is that Secretary Clinton has any number of highly qualified Democrats with a strong record of service to choose from. And President Obama is certainly proud of the service and relationship that he has with the individuals who are most prominently speculated about.\nYes, sir. In the back.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Do you know if the President is going to -- is lanning to watch the speech by Mr. Trump this evening?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not President Obama will be tuning in tonight. But, again, he'll be doing a news conference tomorrow, so you'll have an opportunity to ask him whether or not he watched.\nQ: Is that typically a solo thing, his convention-watching? Or do White House staff get together for this?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not anticipate -- at least for the Republican convention, I'm not aware that any White House staff have made it a social occasion.\nQ: I was sort of struck by his remarks yesterday in sort of the hard things are hard speech, where -- I think he gave a very historically accurate assessment of how progress gets made in this town, but not necessarily a terribly uplifting version of that in terms of sort of stressing the idea that like things take time to get done in Washington.\nMy question is, maybe over the past eight years -- I think it's two things -- one, has his sort of view of how progress gets done in Washington gotten tempered? And two, is there any frustration on his behalf about the expectations from others outside Washington? Meaning does the President think that maybe Americans would benefit from a greater appreciation of maybe how slow progress gets done, and perhaps their expectations on how things get done in Washington are perhaps unreasonably high?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President has talked about this quite a bit. And his view has been that it's understandable that people are impatient, that the wheels of democracy intentionally move slowly. That's what the Founding Fathers had in mind -- that we want to make sure that when we're making momentous decisions about the country that we're doing so in a way that carefully considers the diversity of views that are represented in a country as big and diverse as ours.\nAnd sometimes that means the process of making the kinds of changes we'd like to see is cumbersome, is messy, and is not as fast and efficient as we would like. It's why the President continues to encourage people to take the longer view. And even over the course of the last eight years, we've made some profound changes in this country. And the President is quite proud of the progress that we've made -- everything from reforming our health care system to important reforms on Wall Street to the significant steps that we've taken to address climate change; certainly all the progress that's been made in terms of -- in pursuit of equality for LGBT Americans.\nThere are a variety of ways to evaluate that progress. And in each of those situations, in some ways, the briefing room is a pretty good measure of that. We get pressing questions about whether or not the President was frustrated that we weren't making as much progress on climate change, or we weren't making as much progress on LGBT rights like \"don't ask, don't tell,\" that we were not going to be able to succeed in getting health care reform done. All of those things took longer than the President would have liked. But because of the approach that President Obama took, we've made important progress that is now engrained in our democracy, and we've built consensus -- or at least built a strong majority. And we've had to compromise along the way. But the progress has been unmistakable.\nAnd it certainly is understandable that people would be frustrated that that progress isn't happening more quickly, but even just looking at the arc of the last eight years, people who voted for \"change we can believe in\" eight years ago made a good bet.\nQ: Lastly, on a much more serious topic, I was struck by an article in The New York Times today in which Saudi Arabia clerics call it \"un-Islamic,\" Russian officials say that consequences would be irreversible if continued unchecked. Does the White House have any advice for Americans enraptured with the Pokйmon Go epidemic? And are there any Pokйmons secretly located throughout this White House? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. Let's just say I take no special delight in being the first White House spokesperson to say \"Pokйmon\" at a White House briefing. (Laughter.) But look, I think there have been, in some instances, legitimate security questions that have been raised about the game. It's not one that I'm playing right now. So those concerns aside, obviously this is -- we encourage people to not suspend common sense, even if they look for -- turn to Pokйmon for a little summer fun.\nYes, ma'am, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. As you know, the United States and South Korea agreed on the THAAD missile deployment in South Korea. And the South Korean people are against the THAAD deploying in South Korea. Do you think the THAAD missile is necessary to (inaudible) in South Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, the U.S. government has been working closely with our allies in South Korea to discuss with them what additional steps the U.S. government can take to protect them from the threat emanating in North Korea. And there has been an agreement recently reached to locate a THAAD battery -- this is a highly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense system -- in South Korea to protect our allies from the missile threat emanating from North Korea.\nSo we're certainly going to work closely with the South Korean government to ensure that those protections are put in place in a way that's consistent with the interests and preferences of the South Korean people. South Korea is a democracy, so we certainly want to do this in a way that's consistent with the interests of the South Korean people. But I think this is a reflection of the strong commitment that the United States has to the safety and security of our allies in South Kora, and we'll continue these conversations moving forward. But our priority is going to be on the safety and security of our South Korean allies.\nQ: Can the United States provide information about the risk of THAAD --\nMR. EARNEST: Any risk associated with that missile? I'm not sure what concerns have been raised. But certainly if there concerns that are raised by the South Korean government, we obviously are interested in working cooperatively with them. After all, the reason that we have agreed to locate this anti-ballistic missile system in South Korea is for the protection of South Korea. And so we obviously want to work jointly and cooperatively with the South Korean government to implement that in a way that will maximize the protection that it provides and minimize the inconvenience that it imposes on the South Korean people.\nThanks, everybody.

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121174", "text": "PRIME MINISTER KEY: Okay, so good morning. Can I start by acknowledging the Vice President? We're delighted to have you in New Zealand, sir. And it's great to have you here.\nThe relationship between New Zealand and the United States continues to strengthen, and your visit further reinforces the long-standing friendship between our two countries. We have just concluded a very useful meeting where we covered a number of international issues of shared interest.\nWe spoke about our commitment to working together to address some of the significant threats to international peace and security that we face today – in particular, the threat of ISIL, its brand of terrorism, and its incitement to violence against innocent civilians is of significant concern.\nThe recent attacks in Nice, Brussels, Baghdad and Florida are just some of the horrific examples of why we need to work together in the global effort to defeat ISIL.\nNew Zealand recently extended our training deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. These compliment the extensive efforts of the United States and others to counter the threat of international terrorism and to assist governments in the Middle East to bring stability to their countries.\nWe discussed the ongoing tragic events in Syria, and I acknowledged the efforts of the United States to bring some stability back to that country. New Zealand is doing all it can in its role on the U.N. Security Council to support the people of Syria.\nThe Asia Pacific region is of particular focus for both countries, and we talked about how we might be able to cooperate further, in particular on security capacity building.\nNew Zealand is looking to increase its efforts in the region on countering violent extremism, preventing the movement of foreign terrorist fighters, and stopping the financing of terrorism.\nI welcome the increased attention the United States is paying to this part of the world. New Zealand's commitment to playing its part in strengthening global security was also reflected in recent discussions and decisions to increase funding for our intelligence and defense capabilities.\nThe Vice President also confirmed that the United States has accepted our invitation to participate in the 75th Anniversary of the Royal New Zealand Navy and intends to send a ship to these celebrations. I'm naturally and obviously pleased that they've accepted.\nThe International Naval Review is an important occasion for us, and we hope to have many of our friends here to celebrate alongside us. Both countries and both governments also remain committed to advancing trade opportunities. We discussed our respective progress towards ratifying TPP, as well as the importance of the agreement and helping to lead economic integration efforts in the region.\nWe were also able to discuss more technical bilateral issues affecting trade, including New Zealand's desire to see an improvement in business visa access to the United States.\nMy recent trip to Europe and the UK and Indonesia also featured including the trade opportunities and challenges as a result of Brexit. And we discussed last week's Arbitration Tribunal decision on the South China Sea. While New Zealand does not take a position on the various territorial claims, we have consistently said that the differing interests in the region should be managed peacefully and in accordance with international law. It is New Zealand's view that it's in all parties' interests to ensure that the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea is respected. And we hope that the tribunal's ruling can provide a platform for resolving these issues.\nNew Zealand and the United States are both committed to supporting efforts to find peaceful solutions to these long-standing and very complex issues.\nFinally, I explained the Vice President why New Zealand believes Helen Clark is the best candidate for the U.N. Secretary General's role. This firmly held view is based on her track record as Prime Minister of New Zealand and her leadership of the UNDP. We believe she would bring strong and pragmatic leadership to the organization and an ability to work constructively with the U.N. membership.\nSo today has been a valuable opportunity to discuss a range of issues of importance to both countries. I'd like to thank the Vice President for taking time to visit New Zealand. The friendship between our two countries reflects our common values and shared interests, and the relationship has never been stronger.\nThank you once again. Mr. Vice President, I offer the opportunity to speak.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. And by the way, I'm not going home. (Laughter.) What a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful country. You have a beautiful setting.\nGood afternoon, everyone. I am so pleased to be here in New Zealand. And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the welcome you extended to me and to my granddaughters who are with me. And I'm also honored to receive a tradition Maori welcome before our meeting. They made me a genuine hero with my granddaughters. And earlier today, I got to meet a few real New Zealand heroes – two of the members of the All Blacks. I am a – 400 years ago I played rugby when I was in law school, and I played college – American football. And I was telling them, the two representatives of the All Blacks that came to see me this morning, Mr. Prime Minister, that my brother was a rugby player, as well. And one day when I was a young senator during a recess period, he said, the All Blacks are playing four matches in Ireland. And so we packed up, and we followed them all through Ireland. There was nothing but carnage left behind. (Laughter.) But I am a real fan.\nAnd I also want to extend my appreciation to all the people of New Zealand for the incredible hospitality our very short visit has generated.\nThe United States and New Zealand, as the Prime Minister pointed out, have made incredible progress in our bilateral relationship during the Obama-Biden administration with you, Mr. Prime Minister. And we signed early on the Wellington Declaration in 2010, and two years later, the Washington delegation – the Washington Declaration to rebuild closer ties between our nations.\nAnd today we take another major step to further our friendships. It's with great pleasure and honor, Mr. Prime Minister, the United States does accept – gladly accepts the invitation to send a ship to the Royal New Zealand Navy's 75th celebration this November. And it will be another expression of our close and cooperative relationship between both of our countries that we've worked together so hard to strengthen.\nMr. Prime Minister, we both discussed, as you point out, a wide range of issues where New Zealand and the United States are working together as we speak; starting with economic cooperation. Our trade and our investment relationship is steadily growing. We're doing more business together, investing more in each other's countries. And together, we have led the way in creating high-standard trading agreements that are necessary to uphold the liberal economic order of this new century; agreements that protect workers' rights, preserve the environment, and significantly safeguard intellectual property.\nAnd the vast economic potential here in the Asia Pacific exists, and this is – my guess is the 21st century will be marked by the progress made in the Asia Pacific region. But unlocking it depends on how well we manage differences that exist in the region peacefully and how we maintain stability that is essential to economic growth.\nThat's why both of our nations have issued statements – urging China and Philippines to abide the Arbitration Tribunal's ruling last week regarding the South China Sea. And both our nations understand that continued peace and prosperity in Asia is incumbent upon our ability to protect the environment. So New Zealand and the United States are working together to put this plan on a more sustainable path, to address climate change, and to also increase our role with the goal you have so significantly set of renewable energy – 81 percent of our energy is now renewable. That far exceeds where we are, but is a goal that we are attempting to achieve, as well.\nOn the security front, the Prime Minister and I reiterated our commitment to work as partners to promote peace and provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief throughout the region. Together, we are strengthening the region's ability to address challenges both through multilateral institutions. New Zealand is an incredibly valuable partner in the U.N. Security Council, a committed contributor to the counter-ISIL coalition. And we stand united against the evil that these terrorists promote around the world.\nAnd I said somewhat humorously to Prime Minister that I wish we had the partisan zeal – nonpartisan zeal that you have. If the potential nominee for – become Secretary General could hear what the opposition had to say, I was impressed. I thought she was his sister. (Laughter.) It was amazing. But all kidding aside we have very high regard for your nominee, and she is one that is being closely considered.\nPRIME MINISTER KEY: Good.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But the most important connection between our nations has always been our people. Americans and Kiwis are cut from the same cloth fiercely independent and tenacious. And if you excuse, as we used to say in the United States Senate, a point of personal privilege, I grew up hearing about the Kiwis from my grandfather Finnegan, who lost one of his sons in New Guinea and another son came back very badly injured. But every time the Kiwis were mentioned, he literally would straighten his shoulders, and the same with the Aussies. The regard that New Zealand is held in in the United States – I doubt whether any of you who've visited the United States have ever, ever received anything other than a warm welcome. There is a real genuine affection for New Zealand in the United States.\nMy only hope is that there's a significant affection for the United States here.\nBut we don't always agree. But what we do is we share the same basic values of promoting freedom, equality, and opportunity.\nAnd it's that kinship of spirit that drives our nations' desire – and capacity – to work together to make the world a better place. And presumptuous of me to say but I think that's exactly what we're doing together.\nFrom scientific research we conduct together in the Antarctic, to our shared efforts to protect the Ross Sea. From our commitment to promoting democracy and good governance around the world, to our shared efforts to end the scourge of violence against women, our nations accomplish more because we're moving together. It matters. The whole is bigger than the sum of the parts when we cooperate, Mr. Prime Minister.\nAnd on this trip I traveled first to Hawaii, and I joined a trilateral meeting with our Japanese and South Korean allies and observed our ongoing Rim of the Pacific exercises; to Australia after that where I discussed everything from security cooperation around the world to our shared fight to end cancer as we know it. And we signed three memorandums of understanding on cancer cooperation and the Moonshot that the President is initiating at home; and to New Zealand where the Prime Minister and I have once reaffirmed our commitment to expanding this relationship between our two nations.\nIt's been from our perspective an outstanding trip. And at every stop I have framed to our closest partners in the region the incredible importance that the United States places in the Asia Pacific. We are a Pacific nation. The United States is a Pacific nation. We are not going anywhere. We are here to stay. And we will continue to work closely with all of our friends throughout the region because there's such overwhelming potential from China to New Zealand, from India to Japan. There's such enormous potential in this region.\nIt's been a productive visit, an important opportunity to celebrate what unites all of our people. And I believe that our nations are only going to grow closer as we continue to work together in the 21st century.\nI said to the Prime Minister and his colleagues as we met, this is the hundredth anniversary of William Butler Yeats' poem Easter Sunday 1916, which commemorates the First Rising in the 20th century in Ireland. And there's a line in Yeats' poem that he used to describe his Ireland at the moment, but I think better describes the world as we greet it today and why it's so important we stand shoulder-to-shoulder.\nHe said, \"All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.\"\nThe world has significantly changed in the last 15 years. We have a chance. And great moments of change, which have only occurred in the last century and a half on three occasions, when it occurs, we have a chance to mold the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years if we're smart, if we work hard, if we, in fact, act with likeminded nations who share the same values of democracy, openness, working together.\nAnd so, Mr. President – excuse me, I just demoted you. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you –\nPRIME MINISTER KEY: You might have promoted me – the country.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you, thank you so much for the hospitality. And may God bless our countries and may Got protect our troops. Thank you so very, very much.\nQ Mr. Vice President, will you take a couple of questions?\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Apparently that's not on the agenda, but why don't you shout something on your way out.\nQ (Inaudible)?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I do. I think in the lame duck session we have a real chance for that happening. The lame duck means after this general election takes place in November and before the Congress adjourns. I'm hopeful. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-07-21", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key Following a Meeting in Auckland, New Zealand"}

Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. Let's give it up for the World Series Champions, the Kansas City Royals! I know many of you've been waiting a long time to hear this, so I'll say it again: the World Series Champion Kansas City Royals!\nAs you can tell, we've got quite a few Royals fans in the house, including some Members of Congress. I see some members of my Cabinet—[laughter]—as well as former Cabinet members. We're also proud to be joined by a true American patriot, a World War II veteran, and one of the finest public servants America has ever known, Senator Bob Dole. There you go.\nI also want to recognize the Kansas City mayors from both sides of the border: Sly James—there he is—and Mark Holland. More importantly, Mark's son, Luke, shortstop on—what's the name of your team?\nLuke Holland, son of Mayor Mark R. Holland of Kansas City, KS. The Braves.\nThe President. The Braves? Not the Atlanta Braves. [Laughter] Just want to be clear. But he's a shortstop. He—Skip, you may want to check out what he's got.\nWe're proud to have Royals owner David Glass and team President Dan Glass here. Give them a big round of applause. We've got General Manager Dayton Moore here. Two of the greatest Royals of all time, George Brett and Frank White. And the winningest manager in Royals history, give it up for Ned Yost!\nNow, I'm not sure if anybody is aware of this, but my Press Secretary happens to be a Royals fan. [Laughter] Where's Josh? Yes, I know. There he is right in the front row. [Laughter] If you asked Josh to choose the best day of his life, I'm pretty sure he'd say his wedding day and the birth of his son. But this is close. [Laughter] It's really close. I notice he has his son here, training him—even though he's more interested right now in sucking his thumb—to be a proper Royals fan.\nAnd let's face it, it's been a long road for Royals fans. There were some dark years, some tough decades. But that started to change when Dayton came to town in 2006. He coupled some of baseball's sharpest analytics minds with Ned's managerial style, which has produced a lot of wins, not to mention his own Twitter hashtag: hashtag #Yosted. [Laughter] All of which has combined to create one of the grittiest, most complete teams we've seen in a long time.\nYou've got an offense led by homegrown guys like Alex \"Gordo\" Gordon and Mike \"Moose\" Moustakas. Eric \"Hoz\" Hosmer. World [Series]* MVP Salvador \"Salvy\" Pérez. These guys are all great players. Can I say, though, the nicknames aren't that creative. [Laughter] You know, it's like, Barack \"Barack\" Obama. [Laughter] You know? I mean, listen to this—Hoz, Moose, Gordo, you know. [Laughter] We're going to have to work on these. [Laughter]\nAlso, lights-out bullpen with relievers like Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera. You've got a speedy, athletic defense led by Alcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain, who couldn't make it today. Audience members. Aww.\nThe President. Aww.\nAt the plate, you've got guys who hardly ever strike out. They've been called basically, the best contact team ever. So fast, once they're on base, they're able to squeeze out extra runs because as—I love this quote—as Jarrod Dyson puts it, \"That's what speed do.\" That's what speed do. That was a good quote. [Laughter] That's what speed do.\nAnd then, somehow, they find the time still to sneak Fetty Wap references into their press conferences. [Laughter] Josh, you haven't done that, have you?\nWhite House Press Secretary Joshua R. Earnest. No, I have not.\nThe President. Good, okay. [Laughter]\nSo you can see why Royals fans love this team so much. And I mean love this team. Eight hundred thousand people at a parade. That's like—[applause]. Last year, fans swamped the All-Star balloting process to the point that it looked like the entire starting lineup was going to be Royals. And as a Chicago guy, I appreciate that. Vote early, vote often. [Laughter] So that was good.\nSo, together, you guys have been on quite a ride. For two seasons, every playoff game seems like it's been a white-knuckle game: wild comeback against the A's 2 years ago; the rally in game 7 against the Giants that came up 90 feet short; last year, coming back from the Astros; down three against the Blue Jays; down in each of their World Series wins against the Mets. In all, they have had eight comeback wins in the playoffs, which is a Major League record.\nAnd that includes game 5 of the World Series, ninth inning comeback capped by Hoz's gutsy dash home on an infield grounder. And then, in the 12th, in his first at bat of last year's postseason, Christian Colón clinched the Series with a pinch-hit, go-ahead single that opened up the floodgates.\nAnd I think Christian's play—somebody who hadn't been used a lot, then suddenly coming up big when the moment arrived for him—that's exactly the \"keep the line moving\" mentality that's defined this team. Guys aren't in it for themselves; they're in it for each other, both on and off the diamond.\nThis spring, the Royals broke ground on their Urban Youth Academy in Kansas City, a place for young people to not only steer clear of drugs and gangs, but to also learn skills that can lead to a better future. And that means not just playing baseball, but learning about advanced stats and broadcasting and sports writing and having access to tutoring and internships, college prep, financial literacy courses. This is in keeping with the kind of efforts that we've been promoting with \"My Brother's Keeper.\" And I just to want recognize Royals ownership as well as players—Gordy, Hoz, Salvy, Moose, Chris Young—who have donated millions of dollars toward supporting Kansas City's young people. They deserve a big round of applause for that. So—[applause].\nAnd what's great is, the Academy is built right next to the Negro League Museum, so you can see the link between Jackie Robinson and Satchel Paige and to Frank White to George Brett, to Salvador Pérez and Alex Gordon and the next generation of Kansas City baseball stars. And you see that continuity and understand how central this game is to America.\nSo I want to thank this group for not only writing the current chapter, but hopefully, writing the next chapter of our national pastime, the great game of baseball. Give it up one last time for the world champ, Kansas City Royals.", "timestamp": "2016-07-21", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2015 World Series Champion Kansas City Royals"}

In his remarks, he referred to Beaverton, OR, resident Aisha Osman; Leesburg, VA, resident Raahima Sadiqqi; and White House Associate Director of Public Engagement Zaki Barzinji. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118035", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. Well, Eid Mubarak.\nAudience members. Eid Mubarak.\nThe President. Can everybody please give Aisha a big round of applause? It was such a kind introduction. I want to thank her for her eloquent letter and speaking out not just for herself, but on behalf of Muslim Americans everywhere. She was a little nervous when she came out, and she did great. So I was nervous the first time I did this—[laughter]—but I have to admit, I've done this a while now.\nI want to thank Raahima for sharing words from the Holy Koran. I want to welcome to the White House everybody who is here.\nFor the past 7 years, we've held our annual iftar dinner. Some of you have joined us on those occasions. This year, for my last year as President, I wanted to do something a little bit different, and I'm very proud to host this Eid celebration at the White House. I want give some particular thanks to our White House liaison to the Muslim American community, Zaki Barzinji, for his great work on our event. And we're joined by so many proud and patriotic Muslim Americans from across the country and from all walks of life.\nThis Ramadan, we said goodbye to somebody who was not only a friend to many here, a great American, of—somebody who I had the great honor to know—the Greatest, the Champ, Muhammad Ali. And as proud of his blackness as he was of his faith, the Champ taught us that the most important thing in life is to be ourselves. And so today we are especially honored to be joined by his wonderful wife Lonnie and six of his children. So please give them a big round of applause.\nSo we're coming together to celebrate Eid and the blessings of another holy month of Ramadan. I know we are a little late this year. [Laughter] The advantage is that you're not as hungry as you were a couple of weeks ago. [Laughter] But our celebration is just as festive; the food is just as good.\nFor Muslims across the United States and around the world, this is a time of spiritual renewal, a time to reaffirm your duty to serve one another, especially the least fortunate among us. And it's a time to reflect on the values that guide you in your faith: gratitude, compassion, and generosity. And it's a reminder that those values of Islam, which comes from the word salaam, meaning peace, are universal. They bind us all, regardless of our race or religion or creed, in a common purpose, and that is in our shared commitment to the dignity of every human being.\nToday is also another reminder that Muslims have always been a part of America. In colonial times, many of the slaves brought over from Africa were Muslim. We insisted on freedom of religion, in Thomas Jefferson's words, \"for the Jew and Gentile, the Christian and the Mahometan.\" [Laughter] For more than two centuries, Muslim Americans of all backgrounds—Arab and Asian, African and Latino, Black and White—have helped build America as farmers and merchants, factory workers, architects, teachers, and community leaders. And Muslim Americans have enriched our lives every single day. You're the doctors we trust with our health, entrepreneurs who create jobs, artists who inspire us, activists for social justice, like the LGBT Muslims who are on the frontlines in the fight for equality. You are the athletes that we cheer for, like American fencing champion Ibtihaj Muhammad. She's going to be proudly wearing her hijab when she represents America at the Rio Olympics. No pressure. [Laughter]\nMuslim Americans help keep us safe. You're our firefighters, our police officers, like Deputy Police Chief Malik Aziz of the Dallas Police Department, who's helping that community that is still grieving heal after the tragic attack against law enforcement in that city. \"There can be no actual progress unless we actually work together,\" Malik has said. \"The police and the community must work together. There is no us versus them.\" So we thank Malik for his outstanding service.\nAnd Muslim Americans serve proudly in our Armed Forces, risking their lives to defend our freedom. Now, we're especially honored to be joined by veterans here today like Sheikh Nazeem Abdul Karriem, who fought in World War II. He said he's 95, but I think he's lying. [Laughter] He looks younger. He says he tells people he's 59. [Laughter] And—but we are so proud of him and what he's done to fight for our freedom. And I'd ask all our proud servicemembers and veterans, if you can, to raise your hands so that we can thank you for your service.\nBy the way, I should mention that Muslim Americans aren't just heroes in real life. One of today's most popular comic book superheroes is a Pakistani American girl named Kamala Khan, also known as Ms. Marvel. And I'm a comic book fan. [Laughter] But it's important that our children see positive, rich portrayals of all people, including Muslims from all walks of life, not just in the national security context, in the news and TV and movies, we—the diversity and depth of the Muslim American experience needs to be portrayed.\nSo let's be clear: Muslim Americans are as patriotic, as integrated, as American as any other members of the American family. And whether your family has been here for generations or you're a new arrival, you're an essential part of the fabric of our country.\nNow, of course, we can't deny that we're in challenging times right now. This is a difficult time for Muslim Americans. Like——\nAudience member. Four more years!\nThe President. Well, that——\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. No, no, no. Nope, nope, nope. Michelle is going to come down and scold you. [Laughter] Don't say that.\nLike all Americans, you worry about the threat of terrorism. But on top of that, you fear that your entire community will be blamed for the violent acts of a few who do not represent your faith.\nAs many of you know, earlier this year I had the chance to visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore, and I met with some outstanding Muslim Americans from across the country. And they told me about the great work they're doing in business and education and medicine and social justice. But they were very honest with me about their anxieties and their fears of being targeted because of their faith. And I get heartbreaking letters like the one from Aisha. She told me, \"There were moments in my life where I would want to just take off my hijab and leave my identity behind so I can fit in with my peers.\" That's a young American, full of promise, full of possibility, fearful because of her faith. And we've seen a spike in Muslim Americans, including children, being attacked, mosques being targeted, especially during the final, holiest days of Ramadan. And that shouldn't be happening in the United States of America.\nSingling out Muslim Americans, moreover, feeds the lie of terrorists like ISIL that the West is somehow at war with a religion that includes over a billion adherents. That's not smart national security. In fact, it is ISIL and Al Qaida and organizations like those that are waging war on Muslim communities even during the holy month. And discriminating against Muslim Americans is also an affront to the very values that already make our Nation great.\nSo on days like this, and on every day, we need to be clear about what we stand for. Muslim Americans and all Americans have to reject hatred. Muslim Americans and all Americans have to reject discrimination. Muslim Americans and all Americans have to answer those who would peddle hate or suggest that somehow their interpretations of their faith justify violence.\nAll of us have those obligations, whether we are Christian or Jew or Hindu or Muslim or of no faith at all. We have to affirm that in this country, it is our obligation to abide by the law, to look out for each other, to be part of a single community, and that we can still appreciate our differences and retain those things that are essential to our identities and still strongly affirm our commitment and our faith in this country.\nWe've got to rededicate ourselves to make sure that no Americans feels isolated or second-class citizens. And I especially want to speak to the young people who are here, to make sure that you know that we see you, that we believe in you. And despite what you may sometime hear, you've got to know that you're a valued part of the American family and there's nothing that you cannot do.\nSo during what was a difficult Ramadan, where we saw hundreds of innocent lives taken in Istanbul and Dhaka and Baghdad and Medina, as well as in Orlando and Nice——\nAudience member. Syria.\nThe President. And Syria—I was getting to Syria, but—well, look, I mean, the brutal images and suffering that are taking place there are heartbreaking. And so that—the message has to be sent that we will stand with our friends and our allies around the world, including Muslim communities: that we will engage with those who want peace, that we will go after those who will harm innocents, that we will encourage dialogue not just between faiths, but oftentimes, within the Muslim faith itself, which has driven violence in some parts of the world.\nAnd in the face of terrorism, we will prevail. But we will prevail by working together, not driving each other apart.\nAnd that's ultimately what we have to do as Americans: to stand together and look out for one another. And we welcome those who believe in the basic promise of our country and that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you're from, how you worship, if you work hard, if you are responsible, if you are law abiding, then you can make it here in America.\nThat's the story of Aref and Aida Saad. Where are they?\nAudience member. Right here. The President. There you are way in the back. [Laughter] You can see their hands. In 1973, Aref and Aida decided to pack up their lives in Lebanon and come to America in search of a better life. The couple settled down in Detroit, Michigan. Aref spotted an opportunity. He started a distribution company that specialized in halal meat to serve the growing Muslim population in Detroit. Forty years later, it's a thriving company. And they're now paying it forward. One of their daughters, Fayrouz, used to work in my administration; she now works with the Detroit Mayor's Office helping to welcome today's immigrants and refugees.\nAnd so the Saads, they set a great example for new arrivals like Heba and Rahaf Alrahawan. Heba and Rahaf, where are you?\nAudience members. Right here.\nThe President. There you are. So back home in Syria, these two sisters watched as the growing violence leveled their neighborhood, demolished their home, destroyed their father's car company. And in 2012, their family fled Syria and spent 4 years in Malaysia as refugees. Four months ago, they were able to come to Brooklyn to start their lives over. In their first week, they signed up for English classes. Heba works in a clothing store on the weekends, studies English during the weekdays, hopes to save enough money to enroll in college to study information technology.\nSo when you look at the life that the Saads have built, you look at Muslim Americans in this room who've made incredible contributions in every possible field, it's not hard to imagine that these two sisters are going to do the same. So, Heba and Rahaf, welcome to America. We're proud to have you here.\nAnd that's what makes this country special. You work hard, you do the right thing, and you can not only make a difference for ourselves and our families, but we can make a difference for the life of the Nation.\nSo today we celebrate this wonderful holiday and honor a great faith, but we also recommit ourselves to building an America where everybody has the opportunity to achieve their dreams. And we reaffirm the values of democracy and freedom of religion and tolerance and community building and understanding and hard work that allows all of us—whatever our faiths—to prosper.\nSo I'm proud of all of you. I hope you enjoy this wonderful reception. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-07-21", "title": "Remarks at an Eid al-Fitr Reception"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118076", "text": "The President hosted President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico on July 22. Mexico is one of the United States' closest and most valued partners. Our countries are economically entwined. Mexico is our third largest trading partner, and on any given day more than $1.5 billion in bilateral trade crosses our border. We are working together to enhance our shared security by combatting drug trafficking and transnational criminal organizations. The United States and Mexico partner regionally and globally, including to address Zika and other vector-borne diseases, provide support for refugees and protect the environment and promote clean energy. Today, the Presidents reaffirmed the close economic ties, took steps to ensure easier, safer facilitation of people and goods across our border, and enhanced our environmental, health, and security cooperation. They proved, in short, that we are stronger together.\nEnhancing Economic Competiveness\nTrans-Pacific Partnership\nThe United States and Mexico recognize the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in strengthening economic growth in the two countries, enhancing our regional and global competitiveness, promoting innovation, supporting job creation, and helping to alleviate poverty. Both countries are actively working to ratify TPP as soon as possible.\nSecuring the Future of our Economic Cooperation\nThe Presidents highlighted the importance of working together to advance our economic priorities as reflected in the Joint Declaration institutionalizing the High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED). They also underscored the HLED's success in promoting projects to increase economic growth, create jobs, enhance competitiveness, and foster innovation. The United States and Mexico recognize that broad public engagement is essential to deepen our economic relationship. We will continue to engage the private sector, including small business, civil society, the Mexican-American diaspora community, and labor organizations on an ongoing basis to advance economic objectives.\nExpanding Education Cooperation\nThe Presidents announced the renewal of our Memorandum of Understanding that provides the framework for educational exchanges and research and innovation between academic institutions in Mexico and the United States. In conjunction with the Let Girls Learn initiative, Mexico will provide scholarships to young mothers to continue their education and will continue to promote enrollment of girls in its Escuelas Mexico program, which provides infrastructure improvements, material, and teacher training in 17 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.\nFacilitating Trade and Travel\nThe United States and Mexico agreed to implement our bilateral Air Transport Agreement. This will benefit U.S. and Mexican airlines, travelers, businesses, airports and communities by increasing opportunities for passenger and cargo airlines to fly between Mexico and the United States.\nThe United States and Mexico are developing a pilot program to share border crossing information such that a traveler's entry into one country will be recorded as an exit from the other. This program will include the future deployment of a shared, radio-frequency identification (RFID)-enabled biographic entry/exit system along the common land border to help improve both countries' immigration records and enhance our shared security. The United States will also support Mexico's efforts to collect entry data on travelers into Mexico via an RFID-enabled system.\nBoth countries will continue to enhance and improve existing pilot programs for cargo pre-inspection at the Laredo Texas International Airport and the Mexican Customs facilities at Mesa de Otay, Baja California. A third pilot program will be launched in San Jeronimo, Chihuahua, by spring 2017. Both countries are also reviewing potential expansion to additional airports in the United States.\nThe United States and Mexico, through the 21st Century Border Executive Steering Committee, commit to each use data-driven processes to prioritize border crossing infrastructure projects. We also plan to each develop reference guides that identify options to finance ports of entry on each side of the border. Together, these efforts will help inform and improve our border infrastructure processes.\nCluster Map\nWe welcome the release of Mexico's national cluster map today. Together with the U.S. map, it will show clusters of interconnected companies, suppliers, and institutions and allow individuals, businesses and local governments to identify investment and trade opportunities and plan economic development strategies.\nAdvancing Climate Change and Energy Cooperation\nBuilding on our strong leadership on climate and energy issues, we pledge to address the challenge of climate change, lead in clean energy development, strengthen our energy security, and align efforts to reduce emissions and promote energy efficiency. Both countries reaffirm their commitment to join the Paris Agreement this year, and call on all nations to support its entry into force in 2016. The U.S. and Mexico reaffirm our commitment to adopt an ambitious and comprehensive Montreal Protocol hydrofluorocarbons phase-down amendment in 2016 and to work together and through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to reduce emissions through a basket of measures, including the adoption at the 2016 ICAO Assembly of a robust market-based measure to enable carbon neutral growth from 2020 onward. To strengthen the economic and commercial ties between our energy industries, we announced the selection of members for the U.S.-Mexico Energy Business Council and that the council's first meeting will take place in autumn 2016. The governments will also host a clean energy investment roundtable or trade mission before February 2017.\nOur two countries hosted a public-private dialogue July 20-21, 2016 to share best practices and develop policy recommendations for financing energy efficiency upgrades in public buildings in Mexico, and intend to continue collaborating to create a new energy services market. Future engagements to advance the goals established by our leaders at the North American Leaders' Summit in Ottawa in June include:\n• Development of a work plan to advance methane emissions reduction efforts, beginning with a workshop this fall on opportunities to reduce oil and gas sector emissions, in support of achieving our emissions reduction goals of 40-45% by 2025 and a technical dialogue on national multisector methane emissions reduction strategies;\n• Implement the three-year North American Renewables Integration Study, which will analyze how system operators and utilities can better manage increasing amounts of renewable energy generation across North America;\n• A September 2016 workshop to advance alignment of 10 appliance and equipment efficiency standards and test procedures by the end of 2019, which will save consumers and businesses over $4 billion annually in 2025;\n• A roadmap, in coordination with Canada, on to develop our mid-century strategies for long-term low greenhouse gas development under the Paris Agreement by the end of 2016;\n• An industry workshop this fall on market opportunities for combined heat and power in Mexico, a technology that will improve efficiency and resiliency for industry and communities;\n• Discussion of strategies and actions that to reduce black carbon emission and other short-lived climate pollutants;\n• A reaffirmation of the ambitious commitments to action on motor vehicles captured in the North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership Action Plan.\n• Release a geothermal market assessment report for Mexico by October 2016;\n• A workplan to alignment of analytical approaches to estimate the benefits of reducing carbon emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its ongoing efforts to address negative externalities, Mexico announced that it will, working with the United States, begin the process to adopt methodologies to estimate the social cost of carbon for use in regulatory impact analysis.\nThe United States and Mexico plan a series of technical dialogues to enhance the sustainability of federal government operations. Agencies managing public buildings in both countries intend to reduce their energy consumption and increase the percentage of electricity they purchase from clean energy sources; each side has identified focal points to advance this work.\nThe United States and Mexico commit to launch formal negotiations on a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation (\"123\" Agreement) with the intent of concluding the agreement this year. A \"123\" Agreement would strengthen our existing legal framework and provide an enhanced basis for the transfer of technology, fuel, and other major nuclear components between the two countries, as well as enhance potential emissions reduction in the power sector. It would also enhance national capacities in the supply chain and nuclear fuel services, and facilitate sharing of experiences and best practices in this sector.\nEnvironmental Cooperation\nThe United States and Mexico have a strong record of cooperation to protect our shared water and environmental resources. To that end, the United States and Mexico intend to complete a long-term agreement on the Colorado River by the end of the year to provide for the most efficient management of the river's waters. Recognizing the risks of climate change on the most arid portions of North America, the two countries will enhance the river's resilience through operational, environmental, and water supply improvements, and to deepen efforts at enhancing Rio Grande cooperation.\nWe plan to add three new partnerships to our existing \"Sister Park\" initiative: between Channel Islands National Park off the coast of California and Isla Guadalupe Biosphere Reserve and Bahia Loreto National Park; Yosemite National Park in California and Cumbres de Monterrey National Park; and Everglades National Park in Florida and Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve. This cooperation helps protect shared natural and cultural heritage, including many species of wildlife that move regularly across park and international boundaries.\nMexico and the United States intend to further the North American invasive alien species strategy and action plan by developing a plan to address the introduction of invasive alien species, identify non-native species of particular concern, and protect vulnerable shared ecosystems.\nBoth Presidents committed to intensify bilateral cooperation to protect the critically endangered vaquita marina porpoise, including through the following actions:\n• Mexico will make permanent a ban on the use of gillnets in all fisheries throughout the range of the vaquita in the upper Gulf of California;\n• Both countries will increase cooperation and enforcement efforts to immediately halt the illegal fishing for and illegal trade in totoaba swim bladders;\n• Both countries will redouble efforts, in collaboration with international experts, to develop alternative fishing gear to gillnets that does not result in the entanglement of vaquita and establish \"vaquita-safe\" fisheries; and\n• Both countries will establish and implement a long-term program to remove and permanently dispose of illegal and derelict fishing gear from vaquita habitat in the upper Gulf of California.\nToday, President Pena Nieto announced Mexico's commitment to continue strengthening its implementation of an improved sea turtle bycatch regime to protect endangered loggerhead sea turtles in the Gulf of Ulloa from harm by fishing interactions to ensure their long term protection. President Obama welcomed this step. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to positively certify Mexico's improved sea turtle bycatch regime in the coming weeks.\nEnhancing Health Cooperation\nThe United States and Mexico are collaborating to address vector-borne diseases, such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Today, Mexico and the United States agreed to advance cooperation around research, sample sharing, outbreak surveillance, vector surveillance, and vector management strategies.\nPromoting Security\nImproving Migration and Refugee Protection Protocols\nThe United States and Mexico intend to develop a training program for Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) to begin in early 2017. This training will enhance INM's capacity to identify and interview vulnerable populations, consistent with international standards. The training will also include repatriation best practices and provision of migrant services. This initiative builds upon recent commitments from the Government of Mexico to expand the number of asylum adjudicators and assistance personnel within the Mexican Commission of Aid to Refugees (COMAR). The training will include repatriation best practices and provision of migrant services.\nHeroin\nPresident Obama and President Peсa Nieto reaffirmed their commitment in the fight against illicit drugs, including the heroin crisis affecting communities and families on both sides of the border. President Obama pledged U.S. support for President Peсa Nieto's commitment to tackle drugs, transnational organized crime, and for Mexico's work to develop a new plan to curb opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico. Mexico's plan will complement the balanced approach the United States is taking to reduce the availability of illicit opioids. The two leaders also announced their intention to launch a bilateral group on drug policy to enhance coordination on drug priorities and produce multifaceted solutions that dismantle criminal networks and safeguard our citizens' health and well-being. The group will be charged with advancing our cooperation to address all relevant drug issues, beginning with the Hemisphere's complex illicit opioid challenge. Taking into account the historic level of effort and resources the United States has dedicated to the reduction of drug use, President Peсa Nieto recognizes the historic level of effort and resources the United States has dedicated to the reduction of drug use and towards resolving this public health crisis.\nSecurity and Justice Cooperation - Merida Initiative\nPresident Obama commended President Peсa Nieto on Mexico's historic transition to an accusatory justice system, which will provide greater transparency and access to justice. The President pledged full U.S. support for Mexico's efforts to consolidate the reforms in the coming years. The two leaders recognized the progress and cooperation under the bilateral Merida Initiative to professionalize Mexican police, and committed to redouble efforts to apply international standards within law enforcement and judicial institutions in Mexico.\nEastern Gap\nThe United States thanked Mexico for hosting delegations from the United States, Cuba, and Mexico in Mexico City for a successful first meeting July 5-7 regarding unresolved maritime boundaries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. These efforts help promote better management and understanding of the maritime space.", "timestamp": "2016-07-22", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States-Mexico Relations"}

Tonight, Donald Trump flatly contradicted him.\nFor decades, the United States has given an ironclad guarantee to our NATO allies: we will come to their defense if they are attacked, just as they came to our defense after 9/11. Donald Trump was asked if he would honor that guarantee. He said… maybe, maybe not.\nRonald Reagan would be ashamed. Harry Truman would be ashamed. Republicans, Democrats and Independents who help build NATO into the most successful military alliance in history would all come to the same conclusion: Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit and fundamentally ill-prepared to be our Commander in Chief.\nThe President is supposed to be the leader of the free world. Donald Trump apparently doesn't even believe in the free world.\nOver the course of this campaign, Trump has displayed a bizarre and occasionally obsequious fascination with Russia's strongman, Vladimir Putin. And he has the policy positions – and advisors – to match. Just this week, we learned that the Trump campaign went to great lengths to remove a plank from the GOP platform about aid to Ukraine that would have offended Putin, bucking a strongly held position within his own party. Previously, he celebrated the Brexit vote, and in turn, casually predicted the disintegration of Europe. And now, he won't even commit to protecting our NATO allies against a Russian invasion. It is fair to assume that Vladimir Putin is rooting for a Trump presidency.\nMore broadly, Trump has apparently decided that America lacks the moral authority to advance our interests and values around the world. He has adopted the logic and positions of China, Russia, and Iran. And there will be plenty of time in the days ahead to address his strategy to strengthen our coalition against ISIS, which apparently can be summed up in one word, 'meetings.'\nThe choice in this election is clear.

Good morning, everybody. Buenos dias. Please have a seat. It is always a great pleasure to welcome my good friend and partner, President Peña Nieto of Mexico, to the White House, and his delegation. Enrique and I just worked together at the North American Leaders' Summit in Ottawa last month. Today we have two of the \"Three Amigos\"—[laughter]—although, the handshake is a little easier when it's just between two people. [Laughter]\nLet me start by saying something that is too often overlooked, but bears repeating, especially given some of the heated rhetoric that we sometimes hear. The United States values tremendously our enduring partnership with Mexico and our extraordinary ties of family and friendship with the Mexican people.\nMexico is our third largest trading partner. We sell more to Mexico than we do to China, India, and Russia combined. Every year, millions of tourists and businesspeople and friends and family cross our border legally. Every day, $1.5 billion in trade and investment crosses our border, and that's trade that supports over a million jobs right here in the United States. On a whole host of issues, from our shared security to climate change, Mexico is a critical partner and is critically important to our own well-being. We're not just strategic and economic partners, we're also neighbors, and we're friends, and we're family, including millions of Americans that are connected to Mexico by ties of culture and of language.\nAnd that's why, as President, I've worked to deepen the partnership between our two nations. And today Enrique and I discussed ways to keep strengthening the U.S.-Mexico partnership.\nFirst, through forums like our high-level economic dialogue, we're going to keep working to boost trade and grow our economies and create more opportunity for our people. With today's air transport agreement, we're expanding the number of airports that businesses and consumers can fly from, which will make travel and trade more affordable and more efficient. Both our countries are working hard to bring into effect the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that our workers can compete on a level playing field across the Asia-Pacific region and can open up doors to new markets.\nI reiterated to President Peña Nieto that although I am disappointed in the Supreme Court's failure to come to a decision on our immigration executive action, it is my firm belief that it will be in the interests of the United States, especially our economic interest, to pursue comprehensive immigration reform.\nSecond, we are deepening our robust partnership on energy and environmental issues. Both of our nations are committed to ensuring that the historic Paris Agreement is fully implemented, and we're going to keep on working towards the goal that we announced last month in Ottawa, generating half the electricity in North America through clean power by 2025.\nWith that goal in mind, we are pursuing an agreement this year on sharing civilian nuclear technology. This fall, our new U.S.-Mexico Energy Business Council will meet for the very first time to strengthen the ties between our energy industries. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your vision and your leadership in reforming Mexico's energy industry. I'm also pleased that our nations will continue working to protect our shared ecosystems and environmental heritage.\nThird, we'll continue to protect the health and safety of our people, especially from the opioid epidemic that is taking so many lives and devastating so many communities. Both of our nations, we agreed, share a responsibility to combat this crisis. Here in the United States, we're working to improve treatment and prevention and reduce the availability of illicit drugs. And I applaud President Peña Nieto's commitment to combating organized crime and for developing a new plan to curb poppy cultivation and heroin production. We continue to deploy 21st-century technologies to secure our shared border. And as Mexico makes important reforms to its judicial system, we are working together to strengthen law enforcement and to strengthen observance of human rights and the rule of law.\nFourth, we're stepping up our efforts to tackle regional and global challenges, from confronting cyber threats to fighting diseases like Zika and Dengue. We'll keep partnering with Central American countries to address the instability and poverty that's prompted so many people to embark on the dangerous journey north. And even as we address migration challenges in our own hemisphere, I am very grateful that Mexico is taking an important step on refugee issues and will be cohosting our refugee summit at the United Nations this September.\nAnd finally, we continue to strengthen the strong ties between our people. We want more American students studying in Mexico. We want more Mexican students studying in the United States. So today we agreed to extend and update our educational cooperation. Through efforts like our 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, we're expanding opportunities for educational exchanges and scientific partnerships and research collaborations. And we're working to help girls learn around the world, including Mexico's commitment to support teachers and schools throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIn closing, since this is most likely to be our final White House meeting, I'm reminded of what President Peña Nieto said when he first came here almost 4 years ago. Enrique, you said that our nations had a great opportunity \"to have a closer link of brotherhood, of sisterhood, of collaboration, and of course, of great accomplishments.\" I am proud of what we've achieved together and proud to stand with you and the Mexican people as our brothers and sisters in progress. And I'm confident that our nations will continue to grow even stronger and more prosperous together in the future.\nMuchas gracias. Thank you very much.\nPresident Peña Nieto. Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank President Barack Obama for this very kind invitation to be holding this official visit here at the White House, perhaps the last one that will be taking place here at the White House during your administration, President Obama.\nAnd I would also like to particularly here say how important this friendship is, the friendship we have always had from President Obama. And he has been, and his administration, they have been very good neighbors. He has been a very good neighbor and a President committed with the less favored of his country and with stability also and harmony in our hemisphere and with a solution of global challenges, as for instance climate change, international migration, and the reduction of nuclear weapons. I would also like to recognize in his administration the decisive support of favoring migrants, including the over 35 million people of Mexican origin who live in the United States, who are part of the generation of wealth and employment in this country.\nI would also like to take advantage of expressing our condolences of the Mexican people, my personal condolences, for the lamentable events in Texas and Louisiana.\nI fully recognize and acknowledge in President Obama a leader committed in our bilateral relationship, which I should say is today going through one of its best moments and stages in the relationship of the history between our two countries.\nIn this visit, we have agreed to work on an agenda since 2013, a multithematic agenda favoring regional competitiveness. We coincided during our meeting this morning on the importance of institutionalizing accomplishments so that they will be lasting throughout time, with a bilateral forum on higher education. This year, over 64,000 Mexican students will be carrying out academic activities here in the United States.\nAnd on the other hand, the high-level economic dialogue, with the participation of officials of both administrations of the highest ranking level, has undoubtedly become a platform for integration, competitiveness, and growth. And we have also agreed, ladies and gentlemen, in this meeting to give it a permanent character so that the benefits that derive from this dialogue will be extended throughout time.\nNow we have joint cargo inspection programs to reduce costs of up to 50 percent—that is half the cost—and waiting times that have also been reduced by 60 percent. We've also implemented this project, this program at the Laredo, Texas, airport, at the Mesa Otay Baja border crossing, and soon this will also be operating in Ciudad Juarez. With projects such as this, we're building a safer, more modern and agile border, a border that undoubtedly generates prosperity for both countries.\nUnder this framework of competitiveness, we are now celebrating going into effect of the bilateral agreement favoring connectivity between both countries so that as of the moment this agreement goes into effect, we are going to have more flights, more flights that will be better connecting Mexico and the United States.\nAnd today we've also formalized the Energy Business Council to support Mexico's transition towards an open and competitive market. And we said that the issues related to security and migration should be analyzed from an internal, comprehensive perspective under the principle of shared responsibility.\nWe coincide in the fact that the consumption and fighting consumption in trafficking in heroin is a priority and that we should find solutions to this challenge. We both raised for this. We have created a high-level task force on drugs focused on heroin and fentanyl.\nAnd we've also decided to increase our cooperation with the governments of Central America, especially Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, so that we can look into migration issues, especially the protection of children that are traveling unaccompanied.\nFinally, let me refer to the electoral process that's taking place here in the United States. And let me say that the closeness between the United States and Mexico is more than just a relationship between two governments. It is a solid, a sound, unbreakable relationship among millions of peoples who live in both nations. And for Mexicans, for Americans, we are all united by 3,000 kilometers of border with neighboring States—10 neighboring States—and a population of over 50 million inhabitants. And their well-being depends on the well-being of their neighbors. And for the Mexican people, for the Mexican Government, the very good relationship with the United States of America is, of course, essential.\nAnd from now on and right here, let me express my absolute will of collaboration to whomever is elected in November as the leader of this great Nation. The next Madam or President of the United States will find in Mexico and its Government a constructive attitude with proposals and good faith to strengthen the relationship between our two nations.\nI am certain, ladies and gentlemen, that the political process in the following months will be characterized by the intensity of the debate and the contrast of ideas and the vitality of the citizens' participation, according to the great democratic tradition that characterizes the United States. The Mexican Government will be observing with great interest the electoral process of this country, but it will not give its opinion. It will not get involved in said process. This is an issue that fully, exclusively corresponds to the people of the United States.\nAnd Mrs. Hillary Clinton and Mr. Donald Trump, I would like to express to both of them my greatest respect, my deepest respect. And from right now, I propose going into a frank, open dialogue with whomever is elected. On the relationship between our two nations, I am sure that with the Government of the United States, it will be possible to take a step ahead so that we can face common challenges and take advantage of our enormous opportunities that we share, of course, and find solutions, solutions for possible differences.\nUndoubtedly, for Mexico, it is very important for the United States to do well and for the United States to have a strong economy. And for the United States, it's also very convenient for the Mexican economy to also do well. And your next Madam President or President will find in Mexico a strategic partner to face economic security issues that we share and all the challenges that we share.\nI would like to reiterate, President Barack Obama, my appreciation for your hospitality, for this fraternal meeting and for everything, because this is tracing the route and the promise that we can continue working together as sister nations and neighbors. And I reiterate my broadest recognition, President Obama, for being invariably a great friend of Mexico.\nThank you very much.\nPresident Obama. We've got time for a few questions, starting with Kevin Corke [Fox News].\nRepublican National Convention/Crime Rates/Immigration/The President's Approval Rating\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Obama. Yes.\nQ. I'm wondering if you had a chance to take in the RNC last night, get your reaction to the comments made by the Republican Presidential nominee. And specifically, how do you counterbalance—as we look ahead to Philadelphia, how do you counterbalance what was clearly an appealing message to many working class Americans?\nAnd I wanted to drill down also on his comments about the wall. He said once again there's a need for a wall. And I ask that question because you and I know that the United States spends tens of millions of dollars on a barrier between our two countries already, so I'm wondering, where does Mr. Trump have it wrong as far as a need for a wall?\nAnd you may also know, sir, that your approval ratings are historically high—congrats on that. And yet your right track, wrong track—about two-thirds of Americans still say we're on a wrong track. Can you sort of square that disconnect? Is it unfair to say that's an indictment of your Presidency? [Laughter]\nAnd, Mr. President, thank you for coming. Two simple questions. One—and you kind of touched on this—Donald Trump very well could be the President in January. How do you work with a person, how do you partner with a person, that you've previously compared to Hitler and Mussolini? And specifically, on antinarcotic interdiction and anti-human trafficking interdiction on the border, are you satisfied with the job that you've done as President? And what should Mexico be doing more of to help stem the tide?\nThank you, gentlemen.\nPresident Obama. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the city of Cleveland, Secret Service, local law enforcement that managed a big influx of people and the occasional protestor and just a lot of activity, and made sure that everybody was looked after, everybody was safe. I think they did a great job hosting.\nSecond, the Republicans had an opportunity this week to share their vision with the country and emphasize those issues that they thought were important. And I'm going to let the American people judge how persuasive their arguments were. Next week, the Democrats will have an opportunity to present their vision of both the progress we've made and how we make sure that everybody gets opportunity and security in the future.\nI noticed a little bit of editorializing there, Kevin, when you said, how do I counter a message that was \"clearly appealing to working class Americans.\" I don't know if you've talked to all of them. [Laughter]\nQ. Only in Ohio. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. Well, it's the—so it's not really clear how appealing it was. We'll find out. That's what elections are for.\nI did not watch the convention. I don't think that's a surprise. I've got a lot of stuff to do—[laughter]—and they are pretty long events. But I did read some of what was said. And the one thing that I think is important to recognize is this idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jibe with the experience of most people. I mean, I hope people, the next morning, walked outside and birds were chirping and the sun was out, and this afternoon people will be watching their kids play in sports teams and go to the swimming pool, and folks are going to work and getting ready for the weekend. And in particular, I think it is important just to be absolutely clear here that some of the fears that were expressed throughout the week just don't jibe with the facts.\nSo let's take two specific examples. When it comes to crime, the violent crime rate in America has been lower during my Presidency than any time in the last three, four decades. And although it is true that we've seen an uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities this year, the fact of the matter is, is that the murder rate today, the violence rate today is far lower than it was when Ronald Reagan was President and lower than when I took office. We've just gone through a tragic period where we saw both a tragedy in Minnesota and Baton Rouge and then the insanity and the viciousness of people targeting police officers. And we are all heartbroken by that, and we're all troubled by how we can rebuild trust, support law enforcement, and make sure that communities feel that they are being fairly policed. But the fact is that the rate of intentional killings of police officers is also significantly lower than it was when Ronald Reagan was President. Now, those are facts. That's the data.\nWhen it comes to immigration, I think Americans expect that our immigration process is orderly and it is legal. And we have put unprecedented resources at our border. Well, it turns out that the rate of illegal migration into the United States today is lower by two-thirds than it was when Ronald Reagan was President. We have far fewer undocumented workers crossing the border today than we did in the eighties or the nineties or when George Bush was President. That's a fact.\nSo the one thing that I think is important is—obviously, there are going to be different visions about where we should go as a country: How we can provide jobs, how we can make sure that our kids are able to get the education they need to succeed in the 21st century, how do we deal with our budget, how do we make sure our tax system is fair, how do we deal with very real issues around growing inequality or wages that have not gone up as fast as we want and the real pressures that a lot of families feel. But we're not going to make good decisions based on fears that don't have a basis in fact.\nAnd that, I think, is something that I hope all Americans pay attention to. America is much less violent than it was 20, 30 years ago. And immigration is much less a problem than it was not just 20, 30 years ago, but when I came in as President. That doesn't mean we have solved those problems, but those are facts.\nI think that covers just about everything—oh, you had some question about my approval ratings being high and right track, wrong track being——\nQ. Right track——\nPresident Obama. I think if you look at almost every year, under every President over the last, I don't know, 20, 30 years, you're going to be hard pressed to find a year in which the majority of Americans thought we were on the right track. Maybe because all the good things that are happening in America don't get reported on a lot. So I don't think that's actually unusual. But I appreciate you bringing up the fact that my poll numbers are doing okay. [Laughter]\nPresident Peña Nieto. Thank you very much, President Obama.\nLet me reiterate what I said a few minutes ago. The relationship between the United States and Mexico goes over and beyond the relationship between two governments. This is a relationship that has been built as of two peoples who have a common life—or millions of people who have their everyday lives in both nations; a relationship that undoubtedly involves millions of inhabitants of both countries.\nI would also like to say, as I've said before, that for the Mexican administration, the democratic process, that you live here in the American Union, and for this process we will always be absolutely respectful. We will not get involved. We will not give our opinion. We will not set any type of position. Because at the end of the day, this corresponds to the people of the United States, and it is the American people who have to decide who the next male or female President will be. But what we can say right now is that whomever is elected here as President, the Mexican Government will be working in a very constructive manner, with good faith. I am certain that the relationship between both countries goes beyond the mere economic environment.\nHere, President Obama has highlighted many of the such relevant figures that show the vitality of the economic relationship, the trade and commerce relationship between our two nations, the millions of jobs that are generated in the United States and in Mexico as exactly the economic relationship.\nBut there's another very important aspect that I should highlight: the good cooperation that we have in terms of security, not only for the Mexican Government to combat organized crime in a more efficient manner, but also for the U.S. Government to efficiently fight criminal groups that practically are not respecting any type of border and that are cooperating in both nations. The cooperation in terms of security between Mexico and the United States is also ever present in the fight against terrorism. We are working so that we can turn North America into a terrorism-free nation and have a part of the world, of course.\nAnd this is something we share every day in this—every day cooperation. We share information. We do activities together. And we are always trying to keep North America as a region free of the presence of terrorism.\nThe relationship between Mexico and the United States is very broad and at different fronts. That is why the attitude and the position of my administration in terms of committing ourselves to continue working with whomever is elected as President of the United States, it is the decision that—we are going to respect the decision of the American people.\nAnd let me also say that never before have I said anything, have I given any adjective to any of the candidates in the democratic competition here in the United States. Any issue, anything that I have said has been taken out of context. And especially, if we gather everything that has been said on this process, if you see everything that I have said, invariably I have expressed absolute respect for this process, because, I reiterate, this is an issue that's in the decision of the American people, exclusively of the people of the United States.\nTrade\nQ. Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Presidents. Both governments have expressed that they are in favor of the free market and globalization. We've heard some voices that oppose themselves to this paradigm. Candidate Trump has pointed out that he is inclined towards protectionism. My question is, do the legal mechanisms of NAFTA provide it with strength so that it is not put aside by decree?\nAnd, President Obama, I'd like to ask you what pending issues you have in your administration that you would have liked to complete? Thank you.\nPresident Peña Nieto. I think the free market model of commercial trade openness, this model has undoubtedly shown enormous benefits for nations, for those of us that follow this model, of course. And let me just say that as of the agreement signed with the United States and Canada—I'm talking about NAFTA, of course—the trade level grew over 500 percent—547 percent to be exact—in this last 20 years of NAFTA. And this undoubtedly is reflected in more productive investments, in the creation of jobs as well. And it has promoted different projects for the development of infrastructure to make our countries even more competitive.\nI also think that what is happening is that whenever we've had a slowdown process in the world economy, we start questioning the model, no doubt. However—and this is something I'm fully convinced of—no doubt that this model Mexico has followed and promoted and fostered, well, it has had a particularly important strategic partnership with the U.S. and Canada.\nThis is a model that still promises a lot of things, so much for the benefits of our citizens, because it allows us to consolidate the North American region as a more competitive region, with a lot more investment, and which we are really taking advantage of opportunities to build labor possibilities for our peoples. This is really something we have to highlight and underline.\nAnd bear in mind, because it represents so much and this agreement is projecting into the future, of course—free trade, of course. Right now we can say that this is something that we have had now for 20 years. And I think there are also conditions to modernize, to update, and to find more advantages so that it will potentiate shared common possibilities that we, the three partners, the three strategic partners, have. I am talking about Mexico, the United States, and Canada.\nI believe that this agreement, which is also strengthened through TPP, which is now about to be approved in the different countries, undoubtedly, they potentialize, they boost, and they create a highly promising platform for economic development and for the benefits this will constitute for our societies.\nI think the mechanism of solidarity and the purpose—I think the position of the United States is that after 20 years of having NAFTA, we now have eventually the conditions to modernize it, to update NAFTA, and potentialize this agreement even more.\nPresident Obama. I agree with Enrique that one of the values of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, is that we've learned from our experience in NAFTA what's worked, what hasn't, where we can strengthen it. And a number of the provisions inside of the Trans-Pacific Partnership address some previous criticisms of NAFTA and will make what is already an extraordinarily strong economic relationship between our two countries even stronger and will make sure that the process of global integration is serving not just large companies, but is helping small companies and small businesses and workers.\nSo what I've said consistently is that globalization is a fact—because of technology, because of an integrated global supply chain, because of changes in transportation. And we're not going to be able to build a wall around that. What we can do is to shape how that process of global integration proceeds so that it's increasing opportunity for ordinary people; so that it's creating better jobs; so that we are strengthening protections for workers; so that we are addressing some of the environmental challenges that come with rapid growth.\nAnd for us to look forward and find ways in which we shape this new direction of the global economy in a way that benefits everybody, rather than to look backwards and think that we can undo what has taken place, I think is our best strategy.\nAnd for all the talk about starting trade wars or increasing protectionist barriers between countries, when you actually examine how our economies work—auto plants in the United States, for example, would have a very hard time producing the number of automobiles they produce—and they've been having record years over the last several years—if they're also not getting some supplies from companies in Mexico. And companies in Mexico are not going to do well if they don't have some connection to not just markets, but also suppliers and technology from the United States.\nSo we have to focus on, how do we ensure the economy works for everybody and not just a few? There are dangers that globalization increased inequality. There are dangers that because capital is mobile and workers are not, if we are not providing them sufficient protection that they can be left behind in this process. And that's what we have to focus on. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership is consistent with that. Okay?\nJuliet Eilperin [Washington Post].\nTurkey\nQ. President Obama, given the fact that the Government of Turkey is asking for the extradition of Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, how are you weighing that decision? How do you view allegations that he helped foment the recent coup and that Turkish intelligence officials have said that they believe U.S. intelligence services had direct knowledge of the coup's planning?\nAlso, with the detention of more than 10,000 Turks, the firing of thousands more, and a ban on overseas travel by academics there, at what point do you need to speak out more forcefully about these tactics?\nAnd, Señor Presidente, I did my undergraduate thesis on the PRI and the legacy of the revolution and how that shaped your nation's politics.\n[At this point, the reporter spoke in Spanish, and no translation was provided. She then continued in English as follows.]\nMy question for you is that you've mentioned your efforts to address heroin and the trafficking and the transfer to the United States. Could you talk a bit more about the challenges that you face in disrupting this illegal trade, particularly given the fact that often, it's transported in small amounts, making the kind of large busts that Mexico and the U.S. have collaborated on in terms of other illicit drugs more difficult?\nAnd in addition, you, like President Obama, have made climate change a top priority. Can you talk about the biggest obstacles you face there in achieving your climate goals, and how climate impacts are affecting your country and the future relationship between the U.S. and Mexico in terms of migration and other factors? Gracias.\nPresident Obama. So, Juliet, first of all, I had a chance to talk to President Erdogan this week and reiterated what we said from the earliest reports that a coup was being attempted in Turkey, and that is that we strongly reject any attempt to overthrow democracy in Turkey, that we support the democratically elected government there.\nAnd I think one of the signs of great strength in the Turkish people was the fact that even strong opponents of President Erdogan—when reports of the coup were taking place and when it was still uncertain who exactly was behind it—even opponents of President Erdogan pushed back hard against the idea that the military should overthrow a democratically elected government.\nAny reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false. And I said that to President Erdogan. And I also said to him that he needed—he needs to make sure that not just he, but everybody in his Government understand that those reports are completely false. Because when rumors like that start swirling around, that puts our people at risk on the ground in Turkey, and it threatens what is a critical alliance and partnership between the United States and Turkey.\nSo I want to be as clear and unequivocal as I can be: We deplore the attempted coup. We said so earlier than just about anybody and have been consistent throughout that the Turkish people deserve a government that was democratically elected.\nNow, what is true is, is that President Erdogan and Turkey have a strong belief that Mr. Gülen, here in—who is in Pennsylvania, a legal resident of the United States, is somehow behind some of these efforts. And what I said to President Erdogan is the same thing that I would say to you and anybody else who asks, which is, we have a process here in the United States for dealing with extradition requests made by foreign governments. And it's governed by treaties, and it's governed by laws. And it is not a decision that I make, but rather a decision that our Justice Department and investigators and courts make, alongside my administration, in a very well-structured and well-established process.\nSo the—I told President Erdogan that they should present us with evidence that they think indicates the involvement of Mr. Gülen or anybody else who is here in the United States and it would be processed the way that it is always processed, and that we would certainly take any allegations like this seriously. But America is governed by rules of law, and those are not ones that the President of the United States or anybody else can just set aside for the sake of expediency. Even when we are deeply supportive of Turkish democracy, and even when we care deeply about any attempts to overthrow their Government or any other illegal actions, we've got to go through a legal process.\nFinally, with respect to what's happening in the aftermath of the coup attempt, in my conversations with President Erdogan, I think in statements by John Kerry and others, what we have indicated is our strong belief and hope that as the dust settles, there is not a overreaction that could in some fashion lead to a curtailment of civil liberties or a weakening of the ability of legitimate opposition or journalists, through legal processes, to voice their concerns and to petition their Government; and that the United States, as a friend and partner of Turkey's, and me personally, as somebody who has worked with President Erdogan for a long time now, would encourage that the manner in which this coup is investigated and people are held accountable and justice is done is consistent with rule of law and the basic freedoms that I think the Turkish people have fought for and defended.\nAnd obviously, we can't discount how scary and shaken not just the Turkish Government is, but Turkish society is. Imagine if you had some runt group of military officials here in the United States who started flying off with F-16s or other artillery and were taking shots at Government buildings and people were killed and injured. People would be scared and rightfully so. But one of the challenges of a democratic government is making sure that even in the midst of emergencies and passions, we make sure that rule of law and the basic precepts of justice and liberty prevail. And my hope is, is that is what will emerge.\nIn the meantime, we will continue to work with Turkey, even as they try to stabilize the situation. The—our base at Incirlik, from which we are going after ISIL hard, is up and running again, and we continue to work with them to make sure that we don't lose momentum that we've built in terms of weakening ISIL's position in Syria and to try to strengthen the prospects for some resolution of that terrible conflict.\nPresident Peña Nieto. Thank you very much for your question because it allows us to show and to talk about a subject matter we have agreed and something that I mentioned in my first participation in this meeting—which is exactly that, related to the creation—as a matter of fact, since we met in Canada a few days ago, creating a high-level group to define mechanisms to combat the production of poppy—opium poppy cultivation, and also opium gum and heroin coming into the United States, which is the situation clearly today. What is reality all about? We see that there's a growing production in some parts of the geography of Mexico where there are conditions for the production of this crop. And there's also a growing introduction of heroin here in the United States.\nWell, this is the information we have right now. That's why we have to get together to build, we have to continue working together to find a solution to eradicate crops and to have alternative crops, a conversion of crops, and create mechanisms that would allow us to face up to this scourge, which has taken the life of hundreds of people, especially here in the United States.\nWhat we have agreed on is to work together and to define the route we're going to be following. I insist to avoid this poppy crops from extending to other parts of the Mexican geography whenever that is possible and thus be able to reduce, to diminish, to reduce and avoid the growing entrance of heroin in the United States.\nBut I think this topic shows something else. It shows us the need of working together. It also shows the need both countries have to face up to problems that are common problems. And crops of poppy in Mexico, which is the base for heroin production, undoubtedly is taking place in places where there's a violence as of the production of these crops and criminal groups as well, who have become stronger through the introduction of illegal weapons, guns in our country, guns, firearms coming from the United States into Mexico. Unfortunately, well, this is encouraging—increasingly encouraging—the opium poppy cultivation in Mexico.\nI repeat, this is a common problem because it generates a problem of violence in our country and strengthening criminal groups in our country as well and the introduction of heroin here in the United States that has taken the lives of thousands of people in this country.\nBut what you have said is one of the many subject matters that are on the shared agenda between our two countries, I mean, the need of having and attending to this in a joint fashion. These issues show a need to work in a very close manner, in a constructive manner, in a very positive way to look into this jointly—us, two governments—to look into problems that are affecting both societies.\nAnd this is exactly what we've decided to do. I want to thank President Barack Obama for his political will so that we can create this high-level working group, this task force to find the best solutions for this phenomenon.\nCecilia—[inaudible]—of the Chronicle newspaper.\nMexico-U.S. Relations\nQ. Good afternoon, Presidents. You spoke about the need to institutionalize the agreements reached thus far between both nations. Besides the free trade agreement, which is this agenda of subjects taking into account the change in the administration in the United States? I'd like to ask you whether you have discussed the extradition of Chapo Guzmán as well.\nPresident Peña Nieto. When we speak about institutionalizing mechanisms between both countries, it is for them to be durable throughout time. There are three particularly important mechanisms that are undoubtedly—are now allowing us to have a very positive, constructive relationship in both nations. First, the high-level economic dialogue—the HLED—that involves the highest-ranking officials of both our administrations that are working in favor of creating a route, a path for infrastructure, construction of borders, an infrastructure which is a lot more modern infrastructure that will allow to have more agile trade and commerce between our two nations.\nAnd in terms of security, something that I have already said as many of the other subject matters under responsibility, security cooperation allows us to fight together, jointly, criminal organizations operating in both countries, and maintaining a safe border. All comes from this high-level dialogue that we have.\nAnd surely, the academic exchanges, academic exchanges seek to have more students from Mexico to be able to come to the United States to get their training, their education here, and North American students to be able to go to Mexico. And this has been a growing impetus. The number of students, it's 64,000 right now—3 years ago, it was 15,000—Mexican students who are coming here to study in the United States. It is precisely this decision; we've decided to continue on this path and to continue promoting it.\nAnd the third thing here is the mechanism to implement innovation, technology, and infrastructure in North America. This is a mechanism that's allowing us to really identify areas of opportunity; to enhance value chains, productive chains, and also supply chains that are there for the production in the United States as well as in Mexico. In fact, we've already defined a clusters mapping process so that we can really promote the economic activity in both nations and how can we strengthen this relationship, of course. And this is another mechanism generated as of the commitment and the will of President Obama's administration.\nSo the relationship between our two countries is not a monothematic relationship, just focusing on security. But we wanted to really try to launch efforts in both governments to promote competitiveness and productivity of the United States, of Mexico, of North America as a whole, and to really promote and foster this region so that it can become the most attractive region for investments, economic growth and productivity and development. And for that, we have to be working in common fronts, especially in joint projects that are jointly defined that will also allow us to really comply with this purpose and objective.\nPresident Obama. Let me give a summary of what we mean when we say the need to institutionalize the relationship. I think it's very important to remember that so much of the work that gets done between countries is not done at the level of Presidents, but is done within various agencies, whether it's law enforcement or economic ministries. And when they establish relationships and systems of communications and shared projects and shared visions, those structures continue even after any particular President is gone and build trust and understanding between countries that are critically important.\nAnd this gives me a good opportunity, I think, to emphasize that throughout my Presidency, both with President Peña Nieto and with his predecessor, we have had consistent, strong communications, collaboration. Where there have been differences or tensions, we have consistently tried to work through them in a constructive, positive way.\nAnd to take an example of something that obviously always gets a lot of attention—the issue of the border—a lot of the undocumented workers or migration flows that we've seen over the last several years aren't coming from Mexico, but are coming from Central America. And if it were not for the hard work of Mexico in trying to secure its border to the south and to cooperate with us, we would have a much more significant problem. And that's not always easy. That requires resources and policy decisions made by the Mexican Government. But the cooperation on that front has been absolutely critical in making sure that we deal with these issues in a serious way and in a humane way. And we continue to make progress on that front.\nThe same is true when it comes to drug trafficking. This is a problem in both of our countries. And as a consequence of the work that we've done together, we have seen progress in some areas, both in the flow of drugs north, but also in the flow of guns and illicit financing south. But we're not going to be able to solve this problem by ourselves. And Mexico is going to need the United States to cooperate in order to rid itself of the violence and corruption that results from the drug trade.\nAnd so the more we can build these kinds of habits of cooperation and ingrain them in our various agencies, the better off we're going to be. And I want everybody to be very clear: Mexico has been a consistent, strong partner with us on these issues. And if they had not been, we would have had much bigger problems on our borders. And the benefit of a cooperative Mexico—and by the way, a Mexico that has a healthy economy, a Mexico that can help us build stability and security in Central America—that's going to do a lot more to solve any migration crisis or drug trafficking problem than a wall. And it will be much more reflective of the kind of relationship that we should have with our neighbors. Okay?\nMr. President, thank you.\nPresident Peña Nieto. Thank you. Thank you so much.", "timestamp": "2016-07-22", "title": "The President's News Conference With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico"}

Please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, I just wanted to come by to say thank you for being here and the extraordinary work that you do each and every day. I was a little bit delayed. Some of you are aware, there were shootings in Germany. And we don't yet know exactly what's happening there, but obviously, our hearts go out to those who may have been injured. It's still an active situation. And Germany is one of our closest allies, so we are going to pledge all the support that they may need in dealing with these circumstances.\nIt's a good reminder of something that I've said over the last couple of weeks, which is our way of life, our freedoms, our ability to go about our business every day, raising our kids and seeing them grow up and graduate from high school and now about to leave their dad—[laughter]—I'm sorry, I'm getting a little too personal, getting a little too personal there [laughter]—that depends on law enforcement. It depends on the men and women in uniform every single day who are under some of the most adverse circumstances imaginable at times, making sure to keep us safe.\nAnd obviously, we have gone through a really tough time these last couple of weeks on a whole bunch of fronts. And most recently, I had the tough job of talking to the widows of those police officers who had been killed in Baton Rouge. And I know that for men and women in uniform, each loss like that is like a loss in your own family.\nBut I wanted to come by to make sure that all of you knew how grateful the American people are for your service, how appreciative we are of your sacrifice. As a general proposition, you guys are not looking for the spotlight; you just want to do your jobs and keep your community safe. And you also want to come home to your own families at the end of a tough day. And for you to put yourself out there like that is one of the greatest gifts that you could give your fellow citizens.\nSo our job is to support you in every way that we can. It is my view—and let's be honest, sometimes, this is a controversial view—that one of the best ways to provide support to our police officers is to make sure that we are addressing potential underlying tensions between officers and the communities where they're serving, that pretending sometimes that those tensions aren't there is not going to make things better. But when we're able to bring people together and strengthen those bonds, then that's going to make the lives of police officers on a day-to-day basis just a little bit easier, and it's going to make our streets safer, and it's going to create the kind of atmosphere whereby we continue to bring crime rates down to near-historic levels.\nAnd I made this point at a press conference yesterday—because we're in political season and there's a lot of discussion—the fact of the matter is, is that as disturbing as some of the upticks in crime that we've seen in some of our cities around the country, including my hometown of Chicago, violent crime is substantially lower today than it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, or 30 years ago.\nOver the last 4 or 5 years, we've seen violent crime rates that we haven't seen since the 1960s. And that's not an accident. That's in part because police departments around the country have gotten really smart about preventing crime and are working with communities in all kinds of smart ways. And we can build on that progress, but it's going to require us to do exactly what you are doing today, and that is trying to figure out how we can work together to ensure that our police departments and our communities are aligned in what we all want, which is families that are safe, people abiding by the law, making sure that our kids are growing up in an environment where they can go to school and get an education and get a job and raise families of their own without fearing that somehow they're going to be struck down by a bullet or harassed and peddled drugs to by somebody who is intent on breaking the law.\nSo this is the fourth in a series of gatherings with law enforcement that we've organized just since June. It builds on the work that we did in our Task Force for 21st-Century Policing. My hope is that it's been useful in giving you some tools and best practices to give you a sense of how departments on the cutting edge are using data to train officers and engage with the community.\nWe also are, hopefully, hearing from you about what you've learned in your experience works and doesn't work and where the Federal Government can partner with your departments and State and local law enforcement officers across the country to do even better.\nBecause the fact is, there's exceptional policing being done every single day. We've seen departments organize community forums and panels and cookouts to bring officers together with civil rights leaders and activists and young people. Many of you, I'm sure, saw the viral videos of police playing pickup basketball with kids or dancing the Nae Nae, which wasn't, you know—[laughter]—that was a brave officer who did that. [Laughter] There are a lot more examples, though, that don't find their way onto Twitter feeds.\nSo I want not only to encourage all of you to implement the Task Force recommendations in ways that are tailored to your community and your needs, but I also want you to share with us things that you think work that can make a difference because our job really is as a convener. The Federal Government is not responsible for day-to-day policing of our communities, but we do have the ability to project best practices and let people share what they've seen that works.\nAnd we do have some pretty good ideas about how to facilitate more discussions in your own communities. We are working closely with a lot of departments about how to collect data and do that better and what we've learned with respect to training that can make police work safer and more effective.\nAnd part of the reason I wanted to stop by here is invariably what happens is, the media's attention shifts. There's a tragedy and a spate of police officers down or a shooting involving police, and it captures the media's attention. And then suddenly 2 months from now, there's a different story, except in one of your departments, somebody is still getting shot; it just doesn't warrant attention anymore, apparently, because it's not part of the narrative.\nAnd what I promised both those who were angry about Minnesota and Baton Rouge, but I also promised the widows and families and children of folks in Dallas and Baton Rouge was that this is something we need to care about all the time. This is something we are going to sustain. This is not a one-off. We're going to just keep on at this. And progress is not always going to be as quick as we'd like. And there are going to be misunderstandings sometimes, and there are going to be temptations for politics to fan the flames of division instead of trying to bring people together.\nBut look, I'm only going to be President for 6 more months, but I'm a citizen who's going to depend on law enforcement for the rest of my life. And I've got two daughters, and hopefully, way in the future, some grandchildren who are going to depend on law enforcement. [Laughter] And I—and so I've got a big stake in this. And I'm going to make sure that I can do everything I can to move this in a positive direction so that, out of some heartbreak and tragedy, we can look back 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now, and say, you know what, we keep—we kept getting better, and police officers are honored, their communities are supporting them, they are safer, and those communities truly recognize that they are being served and protected by the men and women in blue.\nSo thank you very much, everybody.

It would impose onerous and unreasonable burdens on the offices of former Presidents, including by requiring the General Services Administration to immediately terminate salaries and benefits of office employees and to remove furnishings and equipment from offices. It would withdraw the General Services Administration's ability to administer leases and negatively impact operations, with unanticipated implications for the protection and security of former Presidents.\nMy Administration will work with the authors of the bill and other leaders in the Congress, in consultation with the offices of former Presidents, to explore the best ways to achieve these goals going forward. If the Congress returns the bill having appropriately addressed these concerns, I will sign it.

[speaking in Spanish] [cheers and applause]\nI am feeling a lot of things today. Most of all, gratitude. [applause]\nI'm grateful to you, Hillary, for the trust you placed in me, and we are going to be—[speaking in Spanish] [cheers and applause]\nI am grateful to the country who has given me so much. I am grateful to all of you Floridians, Virginians, all Americans for their hearts into this wonderful, wonderful campaign. [cheers and applause]\nAnd today, like every day, I am especially grateful to my wife, ann. [applause] I love you, honey. I love you, honey. And to my three beautiful kids. I am the luckiest dad, and the luckiest has been in the world.—husband in the world. [cheers and applause] this is quite a week for me. Believe it or not, for as powerful as it is to become Hillary Clinton's running mate, that is not the only thing on my mind this week. Our oldest son is here today with his fiancée. He is a proud marine. [applause] and in just a few days you will be deploying to Europe to oh hold—uphold America's commitment to our allies. [applause]\nNearly 2 million men and women put their lives on the line for this country as active duty, as reserves, as guard members. They deserve a commander and chief with the experience and temperament to lead. [applause]\nWhat is—what does Donald Trump say about is great Americans, these 2 million? He repeatedly calls the American military, \"a disaster.\" [booing] and he said that as president he would continue turning America back on our decades old commitments to our allies. [booing]\nAnd all of you remember a few months ago what you said about a senate colleague, a senator, john McCain, that he was not a hero because he was captured and is served as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And he wants to be commander-in-chief. While our service members are out there on the front lines, Donald Trump is saying he would leave allies at the mercy of an aggressive Russia—that is an open invitation to Vladimir Putin to roll in. Even a lot of republicans say that that is terribly dangerous. Ok, I am hiring for the speech writing team. We have seen again and again, when Donald Trump says he has your back you better watch out. [applause]\nFrom Atlantic city to his so-called university, he leaves a trail of broken promises and lies wherever he goes. [applause] we cannot afford to let him do the same thing to our country. And folks, we do not have to because Hillary Clinton is the direct opposite of Donald Trump. [applause and chants of \"Hillary\", \"Hillary\"]\nHillary Clinton—Hillary Clinton, she does not insult people, she listens to them. What a novel concept, right? She does not trash our allies, she respects them. And she will always have our back, that is something I am rock solid sure of. [applause]\nAnd I know that because Hillary knows that we are stronger together. We are stronger when we work together, when we pull together, when we live in the same neighborhood and we go to go—go to school together, and when we are together we are stronger. So, I could not be anymore honored to stand by Hillary's side in this very important campaign.\nUnidentified speaker. We love you. [applause]\nSenator Kaine. I spent most of my life in public service because I believe in doing everything I can to make a positive difference in people's lives. I can see a lot of you out there who feel the same way. Exactly the same way. I am one of only 20 people in American history to serve as a mayor, governor, and a US Senator. [applause]\nSo I have been able to see how government works and how sometimes it does not, just from every perspective. And I have always believed that however you serve, what matters is if you actually deliver results for people. And that has been my goal. That has been my goal in every position I have ever held. Now I know that for a lot of you this might be the first time you are hearing me speak. Let me be honest, for many of you this is the first time you have heard my name. [laughter]\nThat is ok call because I am excited for us to get to know one another. Today I thought I might tell you about me and where I come from. [applause]\nVice president was never a job I thought about growing up in Kansas. Like a lot of people in Kansas city, my parents were not that into politics. Church, the Kansas city royals, that is what we spent time talking about. They had too much going on. My father ran a union organized shop in Kansas city. And my mom, in addition to all the challenges that my two brothers and me were, she was a saleswoman. That hard-working business was tough, the kind of job where he cannot cut corners if you are not careful you can make one mistake and ruin a lot of work in an instant. I learned that working in my dad's shot. My brothers and I extend.—pitched in. My dad would wake us up and say, I need you guys. The last day of summer vacation once, I was so looking for to sleeping in and I felt that he on my shoulder at about—hand on my shoulder at about 6:00 a.m.. And I—but that is what we would do. We would try to get the work done before the day got hot. That is what families do. [applause]\nMy parents, they are alive and healthy and happy today, 81 years old. They taught me early lessons that have guided my life. The importance of hard work. Of faith and kindness and following your dreams. My mom was not much of a lecture. She would live and we would follow the example. But she wants told me, you need to decide if you want to be right or do right. If you want to be right, go ahead and be a pessimist. If you want to do right, the an optimist. And I have been an optimist ever since. [applause]\nI went to a Jesuit school. It was in Kansas city. Ok, some Jesuits in the audience. I like that. The motto was \"men for others,\" and that is what we were taught. And that is our faith, which is important to me, and it grew into something more viable. It became like my north star, my organizing principle for what I wanted to do. Even as a young man, I knew I wanted to do something to devote myself to social justice. And and that is why after raising to the university of Missouri and starting at Harvard law school, I decided to take a year off to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries and hunt doors.\n[speaking in Spanish] [applause]\nWhen I got to hunt doors, my recently—Honduras, the experience of working in my dad' shop was helpful and they helped me learn Spanish. And I tell you. My time in that country changed my life in so many ways.\n[speaking in Spanish] [applause]\nHere is something that really stuck with me. I got a firsthand look at a system, this is 1980 and 1981, it dictatorship where a few folks had all the power and everybody else got left behind. And it convinced me that we're got to advance opportunity and equality for everybody, no matter where they come from, how much money they have, what they look like. What accent may have or who they love. [applause]\nIn 1970, a Republican governor of Virginia believed exactly the same thing. The integrated Virginia public schools after the state had fought for 16 years after brown v board to keep them in segregated. [applause]\nIn 1970 in Virginia, that took political courage, and then he and his wife went even further. They enrolled their own kids, including their daughter Anne in integrated schools and sent a strong signal to the people of Virginia that their governor was not going to back down, was not going to make rules for others that he would not follow for himself. [cheers and applause] so, many years later that young girl went to Princeton, went to law school guided by her , experience, and one day in a study group, she met kind of a nerdy guy who had been out teaching kids in Honduras. Anne and I got married over 30 years ago in Richmond, Virginia. [applause]\nThat is the parish that we still belong to today. Hey, St. E's folks, we will be there at 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow. Marrying Anne was the best decision of my life. And—in my right—am I right? And it turns out she actually learned negotiation better than I did in law school. We settled down and we started a family and we sent our kids to those same public schools that her father had opened up to everybody. [cheers and applause] including one school that I helped build when I was mayor that we named after their civil rights hero grandfather. Now, his example helped expire—inspire me to represent people that were turned away from housing either because of the color of their skin or because they were an American with a disability. This was my civil rights work for 17 years. I brought dozens of lawsuits in private practice, battling banks, landlords, insurance companies, and even local government. That had treated people unfairly. In 1998, I won a historic verdict against an insurance company because they have been redlining minority neighborhoods, treating them unfairly in the issue of homeowners insurance. At the time I won that case, it was the biggest jury verdict in a civil rights case in American history. I like to fight for rights. [applause]\nI like to fight for rights. And I found myself going to city council meetings to raise the issues I was dealing with on behalf of my clients. But I was frustrated by the division and infighting, so in 1994, I did something that seems even crazier than what I am doing now. [laughter]\nI decided to run for office. Man, I was so scared, but I wanted to help my city and community. I knocked on every door. I won by 94 votes, the first of many nail biter's and squeakers. And as I often said, if I am good at anything in public life, it is because I started at the local level listening to people, learning about their lives, and finding a consensus to solve the problem. [applause]\nIn the years that followed, I became mayor of Richmond. I was elected lieutenant governor, and in 2006 I became the 70th governor of Virginia. When we moved into the governor's mansion after the inauguration, my wife became the only person who ever lived there first as a child and then as an adult. [cheers] we had to make tough decisions when I was in office, because it was the deepest recession since the 1930's, but that did not stop us from expanding early childhood education, from building more classrooms and facilities on our college campuses so that more can go to school—because we knew that education was a key to everything we wanted to achieve as a state and it is the key to , everything we want to achieve as a nation. We invested in open space preservation and cleaning up the Chesapeake bay, because our kids and grandkids deserve to enjoy the beautiful commonwealth that we love, just like you love the beauty of your sunshine state. [applause]\nAnd we achieved national recognition for our work in tough times. When I was governor of Virginia, this—best state in America, it allowed a child to have a successful life, best date for business, one of the lowest unemployment rates, when of the highest bond ratings. I am proud to carry that work forward as a Virginia senator serving on the armed services, , foreign relations, and budget committees. They just added me to the aging committee. I do not know why they did that? [laughter] I am proud to support my wife's work. She is secretary of education for the, what of Virginia. And—[applause]\nWe are both so proud of our commonwealth and our great nation. Isn't it great already? Isn't it great already? What a great country. As I look back over these experiences, what I have learned is that god created a rich and beautiful tapestry in this country. It is a rainbow of cultural diversity that embraces all people—[applause]\nRegardless of their race or economic status, regardless of their religion or gender, regardless of their sexual orientation or where they are from. We got this beautiful country that should be a country of wealth, a country of inclusion, and I know that that is a fundamental value that Hillary Clinton shares. You know? [applause]\nI am a Catholic. And Hillary is a Methodist. And I know that her. Is—her creed is the same as mine. Be of service to one another. Now, that is a notion that Americans of every moral tradition believes in, and that is the message Hillary Clinton has taken to heart for her entire life. For her entire life. [applause]\nFighting for children and families, like when she was first lady, after she tried and a recalcitrant , congress blocked her with a big advance we needed on health care reform, she said, you know what? I am not stopping. Can we pass a program to provide health insurance to 8 million more children? And that is what she did. That is what she did. That is what she fought for. [cheers and applause] fighting for equal rights for African-Americans, for Latinos, for people with disabilities, for LGBT Americans. [applause]\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, fighting tenaciously to make sure that 9/11 first responders in new York and other localities would get health benefits. [applause]\nNow, there are a lot of people who put their trust and faith in Hillary I'm a and—Hillary, and she has always delivered for them. Working for the children's defense fund, first lady of Arkansas, the senator, secretary of state, she has always delivered. [applause]\nAnd—[chanting] and you know what? There is something you can tell about a great leader. She has not only delivered in the easy times, she has delivered in the tough times and when she is on the receiving end of one attack after another. She never back down. She never backs down. [applause]\nHillary, whatever the drama, the attack, the situation, she focuses on what matters—helping people. That is what keeps her going. This is how we will continue the work, with a strong, progressive agenda. [applause]\nWe are going to make the American economy work for everybody, not just those at the top. Not just those at the top. And we will do that by making the largest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii. [applause]\nWe will make college debt-free for everybody. [applause]\nWe will rewrite the rules so that companies share profits with workers rather than ship jobs overseas. And we will make sure that wall street operations and the wealthy—corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. [applause]\nAnd while we're on the subject of taxes, where our Donald Trump—are Donald Trump's tax returns? [booing]\nRaise your hands if you think that those returns will show that he paid his fair share of taxes. We will fight for equal pay for women and raising the minimum wage. To keep families together, to keep families together, and bring them out of the shadows in the first 100 days of our administration we will put forward a conference of immigration reform package that shows a path to citizenship. [applause]\n[speaking in Spanish] [applause]\nI will encourage you , if you have not done this, go to a naturalization service where people become citizens. How many of you—raise your hands if you have been a naturalized citizen. Thank you for choosing us. Thank you for choosing us. If you have not been to one of those services, it will be one of the most powerful things you have ever seen. After the oath is taken come oftentimes there is an open mic and people say why they have decided, this is why i have become a citizen of the U.S., and will bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your face when you do what people think about the greatness of the united states of America. [applause] [chanting]\nAnd when you go to one of these naturalization services and you see the people's desire to join this great country, you will basically have this pretty amazing thought.\n[speaking in Spanish]\nAnybody who loves America this much deserves to be here. [applause]\nNow, there is one last part of Hillary's plan that means a lot to me personally, that is kind of emotional for me and I bet it is for you, how to stem the academic—epidemic of gun violence that kills thousands of Americans every year. As governor during one of the most horrible shootings in America's history, this issue is very close to my heart. Very close to my heart. And I know that many of you here feel exactly the same way after that tragic shooting in Orlando in June. [applause]\nWe can do better, folks. We can do better. It was in April of 2007, about halfway through my time as governor, I had just arrived in japan on a trade mission to bring jobs back to japan. I fell asleep in my hotel and the head of my security detail said, turn on the to, there is a horrible shooting underway at Virginia tech, this wonderful college in Virginia. And as jetlagged as I was, I said take me back to the airport. I was getting my first plane home. And I want onto that—walked onto that campus and I knew that as a leader, I do not have any magic words to say that would take away the tragedy come at had to bring comfort to the families that had been killed, the students and professors that had been injured, and also to the first responders who had been there to help them. This—[applause]\nApril 16, 2007, that was the worst day of my life. It was the worst day of so many people's lives, and for the parents and loved ones of those kids and professors, that pain never goes away. Precious 17-year-olds, a 70 plus year old who was a holocaust survivor, that could survive the holocaust, who could survive the soviet takeover of his country, but who fell victim to gun violence because he blocked the door and told his students to climb out the window as his body was riddled with bullets. Survived the holocaust, the soviet takeover of his country and fell victim in Virginia to the poor—the horror of American gun violence. So the vast majority of Americans agree that we must adopt common sense measures. Hillary and I will not rest—will not rest, we will not rest. [applause]\nUntil—we will not rest. [chanting]\nWe will not rest until we get universal background checks and close the loopholes that put guns in the hands of terrorists, criminals, and those who should not have them. It is so easy. Gun owners want it. NRA members wanted. Americans want it. I know the NRA, the headquarters are in my state. They campaigned against me and every statewide race that I have ever run, but I never lost an election. I never lost an election. [applause]\nI do not mind powerful groups campaigning against me, that is like an extra cup of coffee to me. It gets me more excited. I am 8-0 and I promise I am not allowed—I am not about to let that change. Especially when Donald Trump stands in the way of progress on everything the one of these issues that Hillary has laid out in her campaign and many more. So now I am going to wrap this up. We are at a university, I can give a test, right? Three questions to ask yourself. One, do you want a you are fired president, or a you are hired president? Donald Trump is the you are fired guy. That is what he is known for. And when this election is done, that is one thing people were remember about this, is Donald Trump, you are fired. Bankrupting companies, shifting jobs overseas, shifting contractors, being against federal minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, these are your fire guys. We got the you are hired president. [applause]\nLet's do debt-free college, let's build bridges and roads so people can have jobs. Let's go for equal pay and raise the minimum wage. Bring back the dignity and respect for work with the you are hired president. Ok, you are 1-1. Question two, do you want a trash talking president or a bridge building president?\nUnidentified speaker: bridge building.\nOf course you do, Donald Trump trash talks folks with disabilities, trash talks Mexican-Americans, whether they are new immigrants or governors of federal judges, he trash talks women, trash talks are allies, calls the military a disaster. You are right, he does not trash talk everybody. He likes Vladimir Putin. But this is a bridge builder presidents. [applause]\nAs a member of the armed services committee, built great ties with our military families. As secretary of state, made history building relationships across the world that are central to foreign policy, the treatment of women and children, that is what we need. She is a bridge builder. And last, ok Florida international, you are 2-2. Do you want a me first president or a kid and families first president? With Donald Trump it is me first. I will run a university that will take people's money and rip them off. Donald Trump, Donald Trump was in great Britain when they cast the Brexit vote to leave the EU and as the British pound, the unit of currency, getting pummeled, he said this could be good news for my golf course. Me first. [booing]\nBut we have a kids and families first President. [applause] who from her earliest days has been—I will tell you something, I will tell you a secret about this—about us in politics. If you want to judge somebody in politics, it is really simple. Look at their life and see if they have a passion in their life that they had long before they got into politics. A passion that is not about themselves, a passion about somebody else. And see if they have held onto that passion through thick and thin, and good times and bad, whether winning elections or lose elections, come hell or high water, look to see if they have a passion about somebody else and look to see if they have held onto it. That is character. That is our kids and families first, Hillary Clinton. [applause and chants of \"Hillary\", \"Hillary\"]\nOk, when I was a kid growing up my favorite president was another Kansas city guy, harry Truman. Great democratic president. And let me tell you something that harry Truman said that could have been written five minutes ago. He said it in the late 1940's and it is so well put. America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination, and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand. That is so good. America was not built on fear. It was built on courage, on imagination, and on an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand. Friends, Hillary Clinton—Hillary Clinton is filled with sachar is, that imagination, and that unbeatable determination and that is why we trust her to fight for all Americans. That is why it am—why I am with her. Are you with her? [applause]\nThat is why we are with her. These are tough times for many in our country club but we are tough people. That is something else I learned. Tough times do not last month but tough people do—last, but tough people do. And they do not come any tougher , or any more compassionate man Hillary Clinton—than Hillary Clinton. So let's make history and elect Hillary Clinton as the president of the united states.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The address was recorded at approximately 11:40 a.m. on July 15 in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for broadcast on July 23. In the address, Sen. Warren referred to Republican Presidential nominee Donald J. Trump.

The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of this address.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118040", "text": "The President. Hi, everybody. I'm here with Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of our strongest advocates for families and consumers like you. And today we want to talk you about some of the actions we've taken to protect everything you've worked so hard to build.\nEight years ago, after some big banks made irresponsible and risky bets with your money, we almost slipped into another Great Depression. While the recklessness started on Wall Street, it didn't take long before it led to real pain for folks on Main Street. It would cost millions of our fellow Americans their jobs, homes, and savings.\nSenator Elizabeth A. Warren. The financial crisis wasn't an unstoppable act of nature. The whole thing could have been avoided, but we didn't have rules in place to stop Wall Street from taking enormous risks that threatened the whole economy. We didn't have strong protections to keep consumers from being cheated by tricks and traps on financial contracts.\nThe President. So when I took office, in the darkest days of the crisis, I promised you we wouldn't just recover from the crisis, we'd rebuild our economy on a new foundation. To make sure a crisis like that never happens again.\nSen. Warren. And President Obama delivered. He signed into law the toughest Wall Street reforms and strongest consumer protections in generations. Now, trust me, I'm a pretty tough grader, but these new rules are making our financial system more transparent. They're getting rid of a lot of fine print, and they're making sure that if the bank screws up, you have someone to call so you don't get stuck with the bill.\nThe President. Now, these reforms have already made our financial system safer and more resilient. And part of passing these those strong consumer protections meant establishing the first-ever Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, based on an idea that Senator Warren came up with before the crisis even began.\nSen. Warren. And every day, the good people at that independent agency crack down on dishonest and deceptive practices like the ones that helped cause the crash. The proof is in the more than 27 million consumers who, in just 5 years, have gotten refunds and other relief from credit card companies, payday lenders, debt collectors, and others who tried to rip them off.\nThe President. Before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, you didn't have a strong ally to turn to if your bank took advantage of you or if you were being harassed or charged inappropriate fees. Now you do.\nSen. Warren. And the Bureau is also there to help you make better informed decisions. Before you take out a mortgage or a loan for college or a new car, check out the agency's website, CFPB.gov. It can help you sift through the confusing, but very important details.\nThe President. Republicans, and big banks who opposed these common sense rules, claimed they'd hurt the economy. But we've seen what happened to the economy when we didn't have these rules in place. And despite their claims, our economy is stronger today than it was before the crisis. Since we dug out from the worst of it, our businesses have added almost 15 million new jobs. Corporate profits are up, lending to businesses is up, and the stock market has hit an alltime high. So the idea this was bad for business just doesn't hold water. Now our task should be making sure we build on those gains and make sure they're felt by everybody.\nSen. Warren. But every year, like clockwork, big banks and their Republican allies in Congress try to roll back these protections and try to undermine the consumer watchdog, whose only job is to look out for you. Their nominee for President promises to dismantle all of it. Now, look, they may have forgotten about the crisis, but working families sure haven't, and we haven't either. And that's why we're not going to let them give Wall Street the ability to threaten our economy all over again.\nThe President. Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent, if you're a hard-working American who plays by the rules, you should expect Wall Street to play by the rules too. And that's what we're fighting for.\nSen. Warren. Yes. It's about basic fairness for everyone.\nThe President. And it's about responsibility from everyone. Thanks to leaders like Senator Warren, our country, our economy, and our families are better off. Let's keep it that way. And thanks for being here, Elizabeth.\nSen. Warren. And thanks for having me, Mr. President.\nThe President. Have a great weekend, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-07-23", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118045", "text": "Good evening.\nHow great it is to be with you tonight.\nLet me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign as volunteers. Let me thank the 2 1/2 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contributions—averaging $27 a piece. Let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolution, giving us the 1,846 pledged delegates here tonight—46 percent of the total. And delegates: Thank you for being here, and for all the work you've done. I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night.\nAnd let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor, congressman, senator and presidential candidate. And to my family—my wife Jane, four kids and seven grandchildren –thank you very much for your love and hard work on this campaign.\nI understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it's fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am. But to all of our supporters—here and around the country—I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.\nTogether, my friends, we have begun a political revolution to transform America and that revolution—our revolution—continues. Election days come and go. But the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent—a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice—that struggle continues. And I look forward to being part of that struggle with you.\nLet me be as clear as I can be. This election is not about, and has never been about, Hillary Clinton, or Donald Trump, or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency. This election is not about political gossip. It's not about polls. It's not about campaign strategy. It's not about fundraising. It's not about all the things the media spends so much time discussing.\nThis election is about—and must be about—the needs of the American people and the kind of future we create for our children and grandchildren.\nThis election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class the reality that 47 million men, women and children live in poverty. It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy, our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living then their parents.\nThis election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience, the worst it has been since 1928. It is not moral, not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change.\nThis election is about remembering where we were 7 1/2 years ago when President Obama came into office after eight years of Republican trickle-down economics.\nThe Republicans want us to forget that as a result of the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street, our economy was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Some 800,000 people a month were losing their jobs. We were running up a record-breaking deficit of $1.4 trillion and the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse.\nWe have come a long way in the last 7 1/2 years, and I thank President Obama and Vice President Biden for their leadership in pulling us out of that terrible recession.\nYes, we have made progress, but I think we can all agree that much, much more needs to be done.\nThis election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions—not just bombast, fear-mongering, name-calling and divisiveness.\nWe need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor. We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger—not leadership which insults Latinos, Muslims, women, African-Americans and veterans—and divides us up.\nBy these measures, any objective observer will conclude that—based on her ideas and her leadership—Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.\nThis election is about a single mom I saw in Nevada who, with tears in her eyes, told me that she was scared to death about the future because she and her young daughter were not making it on the $10.45 an hour she was earning. This election is about that woman and the millions of other workers in this country who are struggling to survive on totally inadequate wages.\nHillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty. She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure—our roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater plants.\nBut her opponent—Donald Trump—well, he has a very different view. He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour—a starvation wage. While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25. What an outrage!\nThis election is about overturning Citizens United, one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country. That decision allows the wealthiest people in America, like the billionaire Koch brothers, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and, in the process, undermine American democracy.\nHillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country. Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman's right to choose, workers' rights, the rights of the LGBT community, the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government's ability to protect the environment.\nIf you don't believe this election is important, if you think you can sit it out, take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties, equal rights and the future of our country.\nThis election is about the thousands of young people I have met who have left college deeply in debt, and the many others who cannot afford to go to college. During the primary campaign, Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with different approaches. Recently, however, we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less—83 percent of our population—will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. That proposal also substantially reduces student debt.\nThis election is about climate change, the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet, and the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations. Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that—unless we act boldly and transform our energy system in the very near future—there will be more drought, more floods, more acidification of the oceans, more rising sea levels. She understands that when we do that we can create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs.\nDonald Trump? Well, like most Republicans, he chooses to reject science. He believes that climate change is a \"hoax,\" no need to address it. Hillary Clinton understands that a president's job is to worry about future generations, not the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry.\nThis campaign is about moving the United States toward universal health care and reducing the number of people who are uninsured or under-insured. Hillary Clinton wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange. She believes that anyone 55 years or older should be able to opt in to Medicare and she wants to see millions more Americans gain access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs through a major expansion of community health centers.\nAnd What is Donald Trump's position on health care? No surprise there. Same old, same old Republican contempt for working families. He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million people off of the health insurance they currently have and cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans.\nHillary Clinton also understands that millions of seniors, disabled vets and others are struggling with the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for their medicine. She knows that Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry and that drug companies should not be making billions in profits while one in five Americans are unable to afford the medicine they need. The greed of the drug companies must end.\nThis election is about the leadership we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and repair a broken criminal justice system. It's about making sure that young people in this country are in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells. Hillary Clinton understands that we have to invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails or incarceration.\nIn these stressful times for our country, this election must be about bringing our people together, not dividing us up. While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Yes. We become stronger when black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American—all of us—stand together. Yes. We become stronger when men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native born and immigrant fight to create the kind of country we all know we can become.\nIt is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues. That's what this campaign has been about. That's what democracy is about. But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party. Among many other strong provisions, the Democratic Party now calls for breaking up the major financial institutions on Wall Street and the passage of a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. It also calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOur job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency—and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.\nI have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children.\nHillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here tonight.", "timestamp": "2016-07-25", "title": "Remarks to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118776", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:20 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. You look like you're staying cool. I do not have any comments to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nJosh, you want to go first?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Let's start with the pandemonium in Philadelphia. (Laughter.) Does the President feel that what we're seeing the last couple days in the party hurts the party's unity, heading into the general? Does he think the emails show favoritism by the DNC towards Clinton during the primary? And does he have any thoughts on who should be the next leader of the Democratic Party?\nQ: Well, Josh, he's obviously -- well, let me start it this way. There are plenty of people who are in Philadelphia who can speak to the current state of our party and the current efforts to organize our party for success in the general election, and I'll let them speak to that. There are also a variety of ways to measure that. One measure that I think is relevant is the crowd reaction when the First Lady of the United States speaks tonight. And I do feel confident that when Mrs. Obama walks out on stage, that everybody in the crowd is going to be on their feed applauding. That, I think, is a strong indication of their strong support for the First Lady and the deep admiration and respect that they have for her.\nShe's also going to be giving voice to the kinds of values and priorities that this administration has been fighting for, for seven and a half years now. And there is strong support all across the Democratic Party for the agenda that President Obama has pursued and the vigor with which he has pursued it.\nAs it relates to the situation at the, the President has been clear about a couple of things. The first is he deeply appreciates what Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz has done during her five-year-plus tenure at the Democratic National Committee. She took the helm at the DNC at a critically important time in President Obama's career. She had to, on a pretty short turnaround, work to prepare the DNC for the general election in 2012. And obviously the President won that reelection campaign with more than 50 percent of the vote. He's the first President since Eisenhower to both be elected and reelected with more than 50 percent of the vote. And that certainly speaks to some of Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz's skills because the apparatus at the DNC was an important part of that effort.\nSo that's the first thing. And I think the President conveyed that appreciation in the context of the statement that we issued last night. What's also true, and what's been true for some time, is that the President believes that the leadership at the DNC is something that should be determined by the party nominee. The ability of the party apparatus and the Democratic nominee's campaign working effectively together will be important to our success in the fall. And so as the leader of the party, that's the President's interest. So he's long said that it's the party nominee that should make the decisions about the leadership of the DNC. And he certainly has been unequivocal in his support for Secretary Clinton, the presumptive nominee, and her ability to make that decision.\nQ: Does he think Wasserman Schultz was fair to Sanders in the primary?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm not going to get into the content of the email. Obviously there are plenty of people with plenty of opinions about that, and I know that Senator Sanders, himself, spoke to this a little bit yesterday and certainly in those comments he indicated his unwavering support for Secretary Clinton.\nQ: Turning to the investigation into this hack that the FBI is now leading, after the Sony hack, you were all relatively quick to point the finger at North Korea. Are you prepared at this point to say anything about whether Russia was involved in this hack and whether it may have been an attempt by a foreign state to try and sway the election towards Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, Josh -- well, let's go back to the Sony situation back in late 2014. There was a careful and intensive law enforcement investigation into that hack. Obviously it generated lots of headlines. And an assessment was reached by a variety of national security agencies, including the FBI, that the actor involved was clear and the impact that it would have on the investigation to release the conclusions that they'd reached about the attribution would be beneficial.\nSo those are two separate determinations that have to be reached. Ultimately those conclusions will be reached by these national security agencies who are focused on the national security of the United States and the successful completion of the investigation.\nSo I know that there's been a lot of public reporting about this particular matter and I know that there are some private sector entities that have conducted their own investigations and even released their own reports on these investigations. I'm not in a position to speak to the veracity of what conclusions have been reached by private sector entities. At this point, it's my responsibility to protect the ability of the FBI and other national security agencies to do their work, to conduct these investigations and to follow the facts where they lead.\nSo if there's a decision that is made by our national security professionals to release additional information about what they've learned in the context of this investigation, it seems likely, as was the case in 2014, that they will be the first to release that information.\nSo the FBI has put out a statement indicating that they are investigating this situation, and the President and his team obviously have made cybersecurity a top priority. We know that there are a variety of actors, both state and criminal, who are looking for vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity of the United States, and that includes Russia. But as it relates to this situation, we're going to conduct -- the FBI is going to lead a careful investigation, and if there is a decision that's made to release information about conclusions that have been reached about the attribution of this attack, then it's likely that the FBI would be the first one to make that announcement, as they were with regard to the Sony hack in 2014.\nQ: Just one on the President's endorsement for Kamala Harris. Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez pretty strongly implied that the President endorsed the Attorney General over her because they're both African American. Do you take issue with that characterization?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I know that shortly after doing that interview that Congresswoman Sanchez issued a statement indicating that she did not mean to imply that that was the reason for the President's endorsement of Attorney General Kamala Harris. I'm not really sure what she intended to imply. I think you'd have to ask her. The President's endorsement, though, I think spoke volumes about his deep appreciation for Attorney General Harris's service and her skill. And that's led President Obama to conclude that she would make an excellent successor to Barbara Boxer, representing California in the United States Senate. The President certainly stands by that endorsement and is quite enthusiastic about it.\nRoberta.\nQ: Donald Trump said this weekend that he would be willing to pull the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization if WTO stood in the way of his plan to put tariffs on certain imports. I guess I'm just wondering whether the White House has a reaction to this general idea, the possibility of the U.S. leaving the WTO.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the Republican nominee make his own case for the policies that he hopes to pursue. But I think there are a couple of relevant facts that I'll just point out in terms of the way that President Obama has managed the U.S. relationship with other countries in the WTO.\nGiven the increasingly interconnected nature of the global economy, the United States benefits from effective trading relationships with countries around the world. The President has used the example of the American auto industry when highlighting how damaging it would be to try to wall off the United States from the global supply chain. There are parts for American cars that are made around the world, and many thousands of American jobs would be put at risk if the United States and U.S. automakers were not able to benefit from this global market both in terms of being able to make the products, but also in terms of being able to sell them.\nAnd withdrawing from the WTO could certainly rupture those relationships in a way that would have starkly negative consequences for the U.S. economy and for American workers.\nNow, what's also true is that the WTO has been an effective location for the United States to enforce our trade rights. In fact, earlier this month, the United States launched a WTO case against China for export duties that were -- or are levied on raw materials that have critical input from many industrial products. This is the 13th WTO complaint that the United States has brought against China. Over all, this administration has brought 22 WTO complaints against other countries, 13 of them against China.\nThat's more cases than any other country has brought both against China individually, and overall at the WTO, over the course of the last eight years. And it's notable that of the cases that this administration has brought forward at the WTO that have been decided, we've won every single one. So that's an indication that the WTO actually does end up being a very effective venue for enforcing the rights of U.S. workers and U.S. companies in a way that has positive consequences for the U.S. economy.\nSo, again, I'll let other candidates make their own case, but I think what has been proven under President Obama's leadership is that U.S. involvement in the WTO contributes significantly to the overall health of our economy and to our ability to enforce the trade rights of the American people.\nQ: What does the President make of Tim Kaine's shift on TPP? He was supportive of it; right now he's not supportive of it. And secondly, how enthusiastically does the President plan to speak about TPP in his speech at the convention this week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any aspects of the President's speech to preview at this point. But stay tuned. If we can get you some information in advance, we will.\nAs it relates to Senator Kaine, obviously the President, as was noted over the weekend, is quite enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton's choice. President Obama knows Senator Kaine well. Then-Governor Kaine endorsed President Obama's first presidential campaign back in 2007, at a time when few other people were willing to make that commitment. But, again, then-Governor Kaine did that, and the President deeply respected that decision.\nUltimately -- I guess it's a little ironic now -- I'm just sort of putting this together -- many Democrats were unwilling to commit to supporting Senator Obama's campaign that early because then-Senator Clinton was the prohibitive favorite and not many people were willing to take a risk of rupturing their relationship with Senator Clinton in order to support Senator Obama. And Governor Kaine demonstrated a lot of courage, so much so that President Obama, after he was elected, ask then-Governor Kaine to take on the significant responsibility of running the DNC.\nSo President Obama knows Senator Kaine well. Senator Kaine is somebody who early in his career was a civil rights attorney, spent time as a missionary and aid worker in Honduras, and he's been somebody who's been fighting for values and fighting for people throughout his career in public life, including as an elected official. That's something that deeply resonates with a President who began his career in public service as a community organizer. So President Obama is pretty excited about the fact that Senator Kaine has been added to the ballot.\nI'll let Senator Kaine discuss his position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Obviously President Obama and our administration believes we have a very strong case to make about how the American people and our economy would benefit from a trade agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that raises environmental standards, that raises labor standards, that makes them enforceable, that protects intellectual property that's developed here in the United States. And our failure to enter into these kinds of agreements, particularly with countries in Southeast Asia that have some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, only gives China an opportunity to write the rules of the road in a way that would further disadvantage the U.S. economy and U.S. workers and U.S. businesses.\nSo we've got a strong case to make. It's a persuasive one, it's one that recent polls indicate the majority of Americans in both parties support. But I'll let Senator Kaine make his own case or explain his own position on this issue.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. How does the President or you feel about what was in those emails that were leaked?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I have very little insight into the inner workings of the Democratic National Committee, so I'll refer you to the DNC and the Clinton campaign to describe the content of those emails and what it says about the operations of the DNC.\nQ: That's really the whole story here and part of the argument for a breakdown in unity. So is the President aware of the emails themselves and what was in them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm confident the President read the newspaper today so I'm sure that he's aware of this story. But I haven't gotten -- I don't have a reaction of his to convey to you.\nQ: So you don't have a feeling on whether that was -- whether it seemed to be an attempt to undermine Bernie Sanders while this was going on?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I can't speak to the veracity of the emails. I'd refer you to the DNC.\nQ: And what role did the President play in Wasserman Schultz stepping down? Did he want that to happen? And I know the conversation happened afterwards, but how did the President make his feeling known in the process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what has -- the President's view is that the Democrat at the top of the ticket in the fall is the one who should make decisions about the leadership of the DNC. It's been the President's view for quite some time. The President obviously had that prerogative when he was running in 2008. The President had that prerogative when he was at the top of the ticket in 2012. But his name is not on the ballot in 2016.\nAnd what the President does know, from having run and won in 2008 and 2012, is that the party benefits when the party's nominee and the apparatus of the DNC are effectively integrated. And that's why it makes sense to him that the person at the top of the ticket should get to decide. And that is something that was clear to Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz and to the Clinton campaign.\nSo, ultimately, the Clinton campaign had to determine what they believed was in the best interest of their campaign and the best interest of the party. And that's what they did. The substance of the phone call yesterday was simply the President taking the opportunity to express his appreciation to Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz for her service to the country and to the party. And he certainly continues to be enthusiastic about her reelection campaign -- he endorsed her earlier this year. And he believes that the people of South Florida have been remarkably well-served by having her represent their interests in the United States Congress, and he believes they'll -- as he said in his statement that we issued earlier this spring -- he made clear that he supports her reelection.\nQ: The timing of this -- I mean, obviously, it was timed for a reason. What does he think about how this affects Democrats right now and what this does just before the convention and so close to the general election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I can't speak to the motives of the individual who may have released -- leaked this material. Obviously, at this point, I can't even speak to who is responsible for obtaining the material in the first place.\nQ: I'm asking really about the reaction.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that most of the reaction I've seen is from journalists who are covering the convention, and I think that's fine. Ultimately, I think there are a variety of ways to assess how the state of the Democratic Party -- and there will be a lot of people who will be spending a lot of time doing that over the course of the next few days -- but one measure that I would recommend is to consider the reaction of the crowd when Mrs. Obama speaks tonight.\nQ: I was just going to ask you about that, because here we have the chairman having to step down a day before the convention. Bernie Sanders supporters right now are rallying on the bridge to Philadelphia. He just gave this fiery speech -- he's going to speak again tonight. How can you say that a measure of the unity of the Democratic Party right now is based on how well the crowd receives the First Lady's speech? I mean, what does that have to do with everything else that's going on right now?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what the First Lady will give voice to are the kinds of values and priorities that have guided this President and this administration. And it's not just that Democrats are quite enthusiastic about those values and priorities -- Democrats all across the country strongly support them. They are unified behind them.\nSo, again, I think that's one indication of the condition of the Democratic Party. I recognize that there will be some skeptics who will cite other data points. That's not illegitimate. I think there are a lot of ways to assess the state of the Democratic Party. And there may be some skeptics who might overlook the fact that the Democratic Party is enthusiastic about the values and agenda and priorities that President Obama has pursued over the last seven and a half years.\nSo, again, I think there are a lot of ways to reach this analysis, and I'll mostly leave that to other people -- except when it comes to the First Lady of the United States, who I think is going to give a great speech and one that will be warmly received by Democrats in the hall and all across the country.\nQ: Just so it's clear, and quickly, can you just give us your assessment of the unity of the party right now?\nMR. EARNEST: There are plenty of other people who are on hand and in a position to do that.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, Michelle.\nMike.\nQ: Just on that hack also. Has the President spoken with President Putin about that hack, or have other high-level administration officials spoken with Russian officials about this hack?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has mentioned any of these reports to President Putin in their conversations. I know the issue of cybersecurity is one that President Obama has prioritized, and I feel confident that at one point or another, that issue has come up in his previous conversations with President Putin. But I'm not aware that this particular incident, or the reports of this particular incident have been a subject of conversation between President Obama and President Putin.\nQ: Do you have a sense of the motive for this attack? And would it possibly have been to interfere with the electoral process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as the FBI conducts their investigation, they certainly would be looking to ascribe some responsibility for this breach, and, in doing so, I'm sure they will consider potential motives.\nQ: You don't -- the administration doesn't have an opinion on that at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, this particular situation is still being investigated by the FBI, and I just don't want to do anything that would make their -- or say anything that would make their investigation more complicated than it already is.\nQ: Have you said anything to the Russian government at this point about, hey, we don't think it's kosher for you to interfere in our political process?\nQ: Kosher?\nQ: We don't accept you interfering with our political process? Have you sent any preemptive message, that regardless of whether or not they were responsible for this hack, that they shouldn't interfere with the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not aware of any communication like that at least from the White House, in part because this is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation. But I'm not aware of a message like that being sent.\nQ: You mentioned two criteria that the administration examined in deciding to reveal that North Korea was the source of the Sony leak. One was clarity of evidence, and the other was a determination by the intelligence agencies that it was beneficial to the United States to release that information. In this case, would there be other criteria you would consider? And would that decision be shaped by the possibility that this would be an attempt to interfere with the U.S. electoral process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, what I can tell you is that this investigation will be guided by the facts and not by the political implications, or potential political implications. The FBI and other national security agencies are focused on this, and they have experts that they can use to examine this situation. And they will use that expertise and they will follow the facts where they lead to reach conclusions, and then they will determine, based on broader policy implications, how much of that they can discuss publicly.\nSo this is a process that is ongoing. And again, there's just not that much that I can say about it as the President's spokesperson that doesn't risk potentially interfering or somehow making their investigation even more complicated than it already is.\nQ: When Josh asked whether you and the administration thought that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC have been fair to Bernie Sanders, you demurred, saying, \"Well, we're not going to comment on the email.\" But you and President Obama and others in the administration know a thing or two about politics. Looking at it, looking at the way it's played out, do you think she and the DNC have been fair to Bernie Sanders, as you, as astute political observers, can determine from the outside?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what is true is that there are going to be people with intense passions with a variety of points of view. And given the fact that I don't have much insight into the inner workings of the DNC beyond what I guess what we've all read in the --\nQ: -- what we all saw.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, based on what we've all read in the newspaper, that's given plenty of people an opportunity to develop their own perspective and, in some cases, share their point of view. I just don't have much insight into the inner workings of the DNC, particularly over the course of this campaign.\nSo I'll let other people make up their own minds on this. But what is true is that Senator Sanders himself has indicated that even in light of all this news and some of these emails, his support for Secretary Clinton hasn't changed. And so I guess in some ways, when it comes to the view of the DNC and whether they were fair to Senator Sanders, the person whose opinion matters the most is not mine, it's Senator Sanders's. And so he's spoken of this a little bit, I suspect not for the last time.\nQ: And lastly this -- just slightly different than what people have asked before, but not too distant. Is the President happy that he kept Ms. Schultz in charge of the DNC up through this point --\nMR. EARNEST: Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz has done --\nQ: -- through this primary process?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President believes that Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, over the course of the last five years that she was leading the DNC, did an excellent job. And again, I think the results speak for themselves in terms of the President's success in winning reelection with more than a majority of the vote. Obviously the DNC made an important contribution to that effort.\nAnd Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz has also been responsible for leading the party through a competitive Democratic primary process. And the prospects -- again, based on the -- there are many people, publicly, who have taken a look at the election and have concluded that the Democratic Party is in good shape in the general election. And certainly the condition of the Democratic Party is something that Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz deserves credit for.\nI would just add that there's nobody who thinks that being the chair of a national party is an easy job, or is a job where a whole bunch of people come up to you and say thank you. And having worked for two previous DNC chairs directly, I can speak firsthand to that. So it's not just that Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz served for five years; it's not just that she did an excellent job both in helping the President get reelected but also in positioning the party for success in 2016; it's that this is a job that's really hard and is subject to a lot of intense criticism.\nAnd again, I think given all of that, the President felt it was appropriate to give her a call yesterday and convey to her once again how deeply appreciative he is of her service to the party and to the country, and how strongly supportive he is of her reelection campaign.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, it now appears that the Congresswoman will not be gaveling at the DNC to kick it off officially. Does the White House have a view on the appropriate role -- this is a diminished role -- if that's something you're disappointed with given the praise that you just outlined?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, these are the kinds of decisions that Secretary Clinton and her team will make as the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party. The focus of this convention is on formally nominating Secretary Clinton and giving her a venue to make a speech. So when it comes to the day-to-day functioning of the convention I'd refer you to convention staff and Secretary Clinton's team.\nQ: Was there a meeting here at the White House over the weekend regarding the DNC hack?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there have been some reports about national security officials discussing this breach. I don't have any specific meetings to tell you about. What I can tell you is that it shouldn't be a surprise that there are national security officials that meet on a regular basis here at the White House to discuss cybersecurity. The President has made that a top priority and obviously the cybersecurity, both the public sector but also private sector, entities is important to our national security. And this is something that is discussed frequently by national security officials across the government, but including here at the White House.\nQ: So you can't say?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any specific meetings.\nQ: But more than that -- you can't read it out?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm trying to convey is that there are regular meetings at the White House that are focused on cybersecurity. And I can't speak to any specific meetings or any specific agenda items, but cybersecurity is obviously a priority of this administration and our national security agencies, and this is a subject that they need to discuss regularly.\nQ: You outlined that it's going to be a very deliberate process, and you can't say whether or not officially that Russia is behind this. But the Clinton campaign is being pretty direct in attributing this attack to Russia. Do you think they're jumping the gun?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they're not the only ones that have been pretty direct. I know that a number of your news organizations have been quite direct in drawing that link. And there are also some private sector -- at least one high-profile private sector group that's issued a report drawing that link in rather bright lines.\nQ: -- credibility to it, you're saying.\nMR. EARNEST: So I'm saying that this is an observation that other people have made and at least one private sector entity that has looked at this matter provided a whole lot of evidence that's appeared in all of your news reports about this. I'd refer you to that company or to the DNC or the Clinton campaign about those conclusions. Right now, the United States government is conducting an investigation to formulate our own conclusions about this situation, and I just don't want to get ahead of their investigation from here. The FBI is the lead in that investigation, and when they're ready to make -- when they're ready to share some information about what they've learned they'll be the first to do so.\nQ: Josh, I mean the thing that's different is it wouldn't be unprecedented for Russia to hack the administration. They recently have hacked unclassified systems at State and the White House, and that's been acknowledged. When it comes to this particular thing, though, this seems a different level to be directly interfering in an election. This is something that Russia does in its own backyard, meddling in other states. To do it here in the States would make this seem to be a whole other level of attack. Can you explain how you're thinking of this?\nMR. EARNEST: I actually don't believe, at least from here, we have been direct about ascribing any attribution for the other breaches that you mentioned, including at the State Department and here at the White House. That's not because we don't take those breaches seriously. I assure you that we do. And those breaches have been thoroughly investigated and there are a number of steps that have been taken to prevent future breaches of that sort. So this is something that we're vigilant about and will be moving forward.\nWe take those matters quite seriously, and the fact that I'm unwilling to talk in much detail about this situation is not an indication that somehow the administration or our national security agencies take this lightly. In fact, I think it might be an indication of just how seriously we treat this matter that I don't want to say something that could, as a representative of the White House and as a spokesperson for the President, that would make this investigation even more complicated than it already is.\nSo that's why I'm being a little circumspect. And I would acknowledge that fact on the front end.\nQ: One more question. It appears that the last hospitals remaining in Aleppo, Syria have been destroyed by the Syrian air force, with the backing of the Russians, according to U.S.-backed Syrian opposition. There's claims of 400,000 civilians in immediate risk and in need of aid. France has called this a war crime. Do you agree with that? And what is the U.S. doing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, I have seen the news reports of the situation in Aleppo, and it's gut-wrenching. The targeting of medical facilities that treat civilians is something that's impossible to justify. Unfortunately, these reports out of Syria are not unique. We know there's been a specific strategy carried out by the Assad regime to use their country's military might and attack innocent people.\nIt's why the United States and the rest of the international community -- almost the rest of the entire international community -- has concluded that President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead in Syria. We believe that he must go. And it's just not possible for him to make a credible case that he is the right person to unify that country when he's spent so much time and energy and resources attacking the citizens of the country.\nSo we continue to be deeply concerned about the situation in Syria, and particularly the situation in Aleppo. That's why we are redoubling our efforts to try to get the Russians and the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities. We've tried to do that for two reasons. The first is, by implementing the Cessation of Hostilities, we can first and foremost try to bring humanitarian relief to innocent people that have been caught in the crossfire for years now --\nQ: The French called that a smokescreen today, that the ceasefire, the Cessation of Hostilities has just been a smokescreen for Russia and Syria to continue to do this.\nMR. EARNEST: There have been places where implementing the Cessation of Hostilities successfully has allowed hundreds of thousands of people in Syria to get some humanitarian relief. There are places where it has worked. And I think it's important we not overlook those, because that essentially serves as a model for what we would like to do in other places in the country.\nAt the same time, Margaret, I would readily agree that there are some places where the Russians and the Syrians have not lived up to the commitments that they've made, where they have engaged in the kinds of actions that are not allowed under the Cessation of Hostilities. And as a result, the humanitarian situation has worsened. So we continue to be quite concerned about that.\nThe other reason that we're concerned about it is that it's impossible to broker political talks between government representatives and the opposition as long as there's fighting going on. So we're trying to get the fighting to stop so that we can bring the much-needed humanitarian relief, but also to try to kick-start the kind of political transition that everybody acknowledges -- everybody except for Bashar al Assad -- acknowledges is necessary.\nSo that's the state of play. And, again, what's happening in Aleppo is deeply, deeply concerning. And we condemn in the strongest terms the effort by anybody to target medical facilities that treat civilians. That's completely unacceptable and contravenes just about every international agreement that applies to these kinds of situations.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Speaking of Syria, at last check, according to State Department figures, there are about 6,900 Syrian refugees that have been admitted to the U.S. in fiscal 2016. That number seems to be accelerated by some 1,500 since July. Is the White House concerned at all by the inflow of refugees given what has happened in Germany over the past week? Three of the four deadly attacks there have been carried out by refugees.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, the refugee process in the United States involves thorough screening and vetting. In fact, individuals entering the United States as a refugee undergo more rigorous screening than anybody else who tries to enter the United States. That means that these individuals, before they're allowed to enter the country, that they're subjected to interviews; that biometric information is collected about them --\nQ: Mental health screening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to the specifics of those but you certainly can check with the State Department that can provide you some more incite. But once that information is collected, it then is run through a wide variety of databases, including databases that are maintained by the intelligence community, by the military, by law enforcement organizations, including international law enforcement organizations, to make sure that this person is appropriate to admit to the United States.\nSo that's why the President has confidence in ramping up the number of refugees that are admitted to the United States, because obviously almost all of them are innocent people fleeing violence in their home country. Some of them are people who are fleeing genocide. And the President feels like the United States has a responsibility to do our part to try to provide relief to people who are fleeing that kind of violence and including people who are fleeing genocide.\nQ: Is it an irrational concern, then, to have more refugees come to the country, given what's happening in Germany?\nMR. EARNEST: Concern for the United States and our national security is the President's top priority. So I can understand why people are concerned about our national security -- the President is concerned about our national security. In fact, that is why he has ensured that refugees who are admitted to the United States are subjected to all of the screening that I just described. They undergo more screening than anybody else who tries to enter the United States. They undergo more screening than somebody who tries to enter the United States as a tourist. They undergo more screening than anybody who enters the United States to do business here. So the screening is thorough.\nAnd the President has made clear that even as we increase the number of refugees that are admitted to the United States, we're not going to cut corners when it comes to our security. The President has made clear that those kinds of shortcuts are not appropriate. So we can do the rigorous screening, even as the United States fulfills our responsibility to our fellow human beings that are innocently caught in the middle of a conflict.\nQ: I want to draw your attention to something else. House Democrats are pressing the President to take action on nuclear weapons before he leaves office. You may be familiar with a letter sent by five Democrats urging the President to take bold action and implement a no-first-use policy. What is the President's belief about a no-first-use policy? And would he be interested in pursuing that given the brevity of his time in office? He has not to this point.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President has made counter-proliferation -- preventing the spread of nuclear weapons a top priority. And the President organized I believe on four or five different occasions a Nuclear Security Summit, where, essentially, world leaders gathered in one place -- twice in the United States -- to have a discussion about what additional steps could be implemented to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. So this has been a top priority when it comes to the President's foreign policy agenda.\nSo I don't have any news to make about any sort of new policy or any additional steps that the President may take. But the President is certainly interested in taking advantage of opportunities that are available over the last six months that he has in office to further move us toward a vision that Presidents in both parties have articulated, which is a world without nuclear weapons. And it's a long-term goal. It's not likely to happen -- it's obviously not going to happen in this administration. It's probably not going to happen in any of our lifetimes. But the President certainly does believe that our world would be safer and the American people would be more secure if we could succeed in that effort.\nQ: And to put a button on that, then is it fair to say he is, in principle, supportive of a no-first-use idea? Or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't have any news to make when it comes to laying out any new sort of principles when it comes to the use of nuclear weapons. The President's view is that obviously it's a dangerous world, and we're aware of the fact that some of our adversaries do have a nuclear stockpile. And the work that we have engaged in over the course of this administration has been to prevent particular tools or some equipment, or even some nuclear material, falling into the hands of rogue actors -- whether they're terrorists or criminal entities, or even some other countries -- that would allow them to develop nuclear capability. And we have made progress in safeguarding that material. We've made progress in reaching an international agreement with Iran to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nSo we've made important progress in stemming the proliferation of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons. That enhances our nation's security. But we've also been able to work effectively, through diplomacy, to try to get other countries to reduce their nuclear stockpile.\nNow, there's more progress on this that we would like to make, but this has been a priority and one that we're going to continue to track.\nQ: You mentioned the First Lady -- just one more -- values and agenda and priorities that the Democrats stand for. Can you give us sort of a preview of what we should expect to hear from her tonight, and why it's so important that she really take on the mantle of healer, if you will, given what's been happening in the last couple days with the Democrats?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that's how she sees her role. I think what you can expect from Mrs. Obama is for her to make a very forceful case, obviously in support of Secretary Clinton. And Mrs. Obama's case will be rooted in her own sense of values and in the sense -- and in the values that she wants to instill in her children.\nI think, like many Americans, she considers her choice in this election from the perspective of a parent who deeply loves her kids. She's also a First Lady that's had an opportunity to travel all across the country and meet parents and kids in communities all across the country. And she certainly knows that her husband, when he was sitting in the Oval Office making decisions about our country, whether it was related to domestic or foreign policy -- that he had the best interests of the country and the best interests of our country's kids in mind.\nThat certainly is what Mrs. Obama believes is important as people consider who to support in the next election. And she'll make a forceful case that when it comes to the next President looking out for our kids and their interests, she's made the decision to strongly support Secretary Clinton.\nBut she'll make that case much more eloquently than I just did, and I certainly would encourage people to tune in and check it out.\nHans.\nQ: Josh, I want to make sure I have this all clear in response to the answer on the genocide question on ISIS and -- you used genocide twice. And Mark was asking about Aleppo as well. I just want to make sure who the genocide designation is currently applied to.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the State Department makes that designation, so they can sort of walk you through the particulars. I know that they've made an announcement about a determination they've made over there.\nQ: You weren't extending that. You're keeping this just genocide for ISIL, not beyond.\nMR. EARNEST: The point that I'm making is that there are a large number of people who are fleeing Syria because of the violence that has torn that country apart. And too often, some people that may even have a political agenda have tried to describe those people as would-be terrorists.\nI don't think that's an accurate description. This is a group of individuals that I think can best be described as almost entirely innocent people fleeing violence. In some cases, these are people who are fleeing violence that could be directed at them because of their religion, or because of their ethnicity, or for reasons that could potentially put them at risk of genocide.\nNow, there is a concern that has been expressed by our intelligence community that terrorists could try to capitalize on this situation in a way that could undermine our national security. And that's why the President has insisted on protecting these rigorous screening standards and making sure that any refugee that's admitted to the United States undergoes screening that involves background checks, in-person interviews, collecting biometric information and making sure that it's cycled through all these databases. And he does that -- the President advocates this point of view not because he believes that most of these people are likely terrorists and we just need to find the innocent people among them; rather, we understand that almost every individual in this group is somebody that's fleeing violence in their hometown. In some cases, it's an individual who is fleeing genocide.\nAnd we need to make sure that we're doing rigorous screening to prevent terrorist organizations from capitalizing on the situation. And by doing this kind of screening, we can certainly and significantly reduce the likelihood that terrorist organizations are going to be able to capitalize on this chaos and sneak somebody into the United States.\nQ: But you're not trying to broaden the definition of entities who's being tagged by the State Department with genocide?\nMR. EARNEST: No. Again, I'm just trying to help people understand the context in which these decisions are made. And the truth is, almost every single person that's being considered for refugee status is a person that's fleeing violence in their country. And the United States has a responsibility to step up and respond to the call of providing for at least some of those people.\nQ: And if I could just go back to the DNC issue. When Robin Mook said this morning that they have information that it is Russia that is doing this, that's behind this, you're saying that's solely based on private intelligent and private assessment? There's nothing then from the government that has given them that indication that Russia is behind it?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that's a good question. You should ask Mr. Mook exactly what information he was relying on. The point that I was making is that there's plenty of outside analysis that's been done that has reached the same conclusion that he articulated over the weekend. The federal government, using tools that -- using a variety of tools -- is working to complete our own assessment. And that work is being done by the FBI. And there's not a whole lot I can say about that because I don't want to compromise their investigation.\nQ: Are you aware of any official government communication from the United States government or the FBI or the White House to either the Clinton campaign or the DNC that they'd been hacked?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any of that.\nQ: Because in 2008, I mean, Josh Bolten called -- when the Chinese hacked the McCain campaign and the Obama campaign, when you were on the Obama campaign, it was Josh Bolten who called up David Plouffe. And there was something official, that they weren't just relying on private assessments.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, what I'm sure is true is that as the FBI conducts their investigation into what happened at the DNC, they'll have some interaction with the DNC as they conduct their investigation. But I can't speak to any specific conversations that have taken place.\nQ: So they could be relying, though, on something from the FBI that said -- telling them that they were hacked?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't know whether or not the FBI has provided them any information. I guess the point that I'm trying to make is there is always a lot of public speculation out there, including some evidence that has been marshalled by a private sector entity, and based on that evidence, that this outside group that is a group of experts -- I'm not trying to diminish them -- but they've reached their own conclusions about this. So it certainly is possible that Mr. Mook was relying on that publicly available information. You'd have to ask him if that's the case.\nQ: But it's also possible that he's heard from the FBI or the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, you'd have to ask him who he has spoken to.\nDavid.\nQ: Just a couple topics. One is last week you talked about the President not watching the RNC convention. And you also suggested that he would certainly watch his wife, but you weren't clear who else he would watch other than maybe Secretary Clinton. I'm wondering if you could tell us whether he plans to tune into Bernie Sanders's speech tonight, considering Sanders's role in this primary process and leading up to this?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not he'll watch Senator Sanders's speech tonight. But I'll see if I can find out tomorrow if he watched it and we'll let you know.\nQ: That would be great. On another topic. Susan Rice -- Ambassador Rice was in Beijing today, had a meeting with a number of Chinese officials. In the readout from the White House and I think some brief remarks that she made in her meeting with President Xi -- they talked about a range of issues but did not specifically mention the South China Sea. I'm wondering if you could tell us if that issue was -- and the recent ruling by the tribunal was brought up by Ambassador Rice, what kind of message she delivered on that point, and if she got any reassurances from either State Councilor Yang or President Xi about China's behavior in that region -- whether they'll tone down some of their provocative behavior.\nMR. EARNEST: David, I did not get a detailed readout from Ambassador Rice and her team who are traveling in China right now. What I can tell you is that there were a range of maritime issues on her agenda when she went to meet with President Xi. So it certainly was her expectation that it would come up in their conversation, so I expect that it did. I'm not able to speak to the reaction from the Chinese leader when it was discussed at this point.\nBut this was certainly among the wide range of issues that Ambassador Rice was prepared to discuss with Chinese officials, including President Xi. This included conversations about the upcoming G20 meeting -- the President, of course, is planning to attend and I would anticipate he'll do a bilateral meeting with President Xi when he's there. They spent some time preparing for that conversation. I know that she also discussed with them things like human rights and the treatment of U.S. businesses and NGOs in China -- something that we've raised concerns about in the past.\nThere also was an opportunity for them to talk about a couple of issues in which the United States and China have been able to coordinate effectively. Both in terms of trying to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and to make progress on climate change, and obviously we've talked a lot in the past about how the ability of the United States and China to work together on fighting carbon pollution was essential to the broader international effort to reach a climate change agreement at the end of last year.\nQ: Overall, the White House readout seemed fairly positive. It talked about cooperation at unprecedented levels and a very fruitful meeting between the Ambassador and President Xi. I mean, there are others who would suggest that the sort of differences among the two countries are also pronounced at this moment. And under the current President of China, things have, in some ways, deteriorated in these other areas. Why was it such an optimistic sort of readout on this? And when you call it a fruitful meeting, there wasn't a lot of detail about what fruit it delivered between Ambassador Rice and the President. Could you be more specific about what the outcomes were?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think our expectation is that moving forward, that these kinds of meetings are intended to lay the groundwork for positive results down the road. And Ambassador Rice was explicit about in her conversations with Chinese officials -- and not just her counterpart but also the Chinese President -- that she's interested in -- that the administration is interested in a constructive relationship with the Chinese. It doesn't mean there won't be disagreements. Obviously there are a range of disagreements, including on cyber issues. So those of you who know Ambassador Rice know that she is unlikely to shy away from being blunt about those differences.\nBut we've also worked hard in the context of our relationship with China to make sure that those differences don't prevent us from making progress in other areas. And certainly when it comes to things like climate change and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and even some aspects of our military-to-military relationship, we've made some important progress that has enhanced the standing and status of citizens in both our countries.\nSo there are definitely differences of opinion. I'm confident those were discussed in these meetings that Ambassador Rice had. But I'm confident that it's in the context of these discussions, she went to great lengths to make clear that, even despite our differences, let's look for opportunities to make some progress together. And when the United States and China can cooperate on something, the sky is the limit.\nMegan.\nQ: Josh, a question for you on the U.N. report that's out showing a record number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first six months of this year. The majority of those it would show were anti-government forces like the Taliban, but a significant number were pro-government forces. What is the concern of the U.S. as the U.S. is getting more involved or renewing its commitment to work with Afghan security forces for these numbers? Specifically, there's a huge number of children that have been killed or injured.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there was a bombing in Afghanistan over the weekend in which dozens of innocent people were killed and many more were injured. Almost all of those were citizens. And, again, based solely on the public reports, it does appear that the individual or individuals who carried out that attack were intentionally trying to harm civilians. This is a tactic that we've seen from ISIL. It's a tactic we've seen from other terrorist organizations. And it's one of the many things that distinguishes terrorists from the rest of the world.\nThe United States, and certainly the Afghan government, go to great lengths to try to prevent civilian casualties. And I would anticipate that as we see the performance of Afghan security forces improve, their ability to successfully prevent civilian casualties when they're carrying out operations will also improve.\nBut there's just -- it's important not to draw an equivalent between organizations that set out to harm civilians and government forces, including those backed by the United States, that go to great lengths to try to protect those civilian -- innocent civilians. And it doesn't mean Afghanistan is not a dangerous place; it surely is. But this administration and this country places a high priority on preventing civilian casualties and that's not going to change.\nQ: But what role does the U.S. play? The report showed a 47 percent increase in the number of civilians killed by pro-government forces. So what role does the U.S. play? Or how does the U.S. play into that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States is certainly playing an important role in enhancing the training of Afghan forces. And improved training certainly will have a positive impact on their ability to prevent civilian casualties. I think that's the most direct impact that we can have on that particular situation.\nI would also expect that as Afghan security forces continue to make progress against the Taliban and other extremists that are operating in Afghanistan, as the situation stabilizes, that also makes it less likely that innocent civilians could be in harm's way. And that's why a lot of the focus that we've been -- that Afghan forces have made a priority is on stabilizing the security situation in Afghanistan's major cities.\nBut again, these kinds of civilian casualties are a tragedy. And that's why the United States goes to such great lengths to avoid them, and it's also part of why we go to such great lengths to support the Afghan people and Afghan government and Afghan security forces as they take the fight to the Taliban and other extremist organizations in Afghanistan.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. One question on the convention and Hillary Clinton and trustworthiness. CNN and CBS have polls out showing record highs in terms of the number of American people that don't believe that Hillary Clinton is trustworthy. What can, or is there anything the President and First Lady will say in their remarks that could help Hillary Clinton in this area?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when it comes to the campaign strategy, I'd refer you to the campaign. I think certainly something that you've heard the President say before is he's in a unique position to offer up his own assessment of Secretary Clinton. He worked closely with Secretary Clinton when she was Secretary of State in his administration. He obviously competed against Secretary Clinton in an historic Democratic primary campaign. They served together for a brief time in the United States Senate. Through their extensive work relationship they've become friends.\nSo his firsthand experience is relevant. And that firsthand experience is not just drawn from the fact that he is the current President of the United States, but it's also drawn from the fact that he knows her personally, and he can speak with his own personal knowledge of her skills and her character. And he's already done that. He certainly did that in the joint campaign event that they did in Charlotte back in -- I guess it was just a couple of weeks ago now, seems like a long time ago.\nBut I certainly would anticipate that you'll hear the President make that case in his convention speech and in his future advocacy for her campaign down the line. He's got a unique perspective to relate based on his own personal experience with Secretary Clinton. And I imagine that some people will find that quite persuasive.\nQ: Will the First Lady be speaking about her relationship with Hillary Clinton? Was there any interaction between the First Lady and Hillary Clinton over her remarks tonight?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously Mrs. Obama has had an opportunity to get to know Mrs. Clinton a little bit as well. But the nature of their relationship is different. So much of President Obama's interactions with Secretary Clinton have taken place in a professional context, and that is the context through which he can evaluate her skills and her character. Mrs. Obama's relationship with Secretary Clinton is a little bit different. But stay tuned.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Two quick follow-ups on Germany. One, I know that there are big differences between how the U.S. admits refugees and the situation in Germany, but are you concerned that there will be a political backlash here, given this recent string of attacks? And also, has the U.S. taken any steps in recent days to increase security cooperation with the Germans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can certainly tell you that German officials -- German and U.S. officials have been in touch in recent days. And we've been saddened by the violence that we've seen in Germany over the last week or so that has harmed a number of innocent people.\nAnd of course, the United States stands resolute alongside our German allies as they confront the forces of extremism in their own country. I can't speak to any specific steps that have been taken, but the United States is certainly interested in doing whatever we can to support the German government and the German people and German national security agencies as they safeguard their own country.\nWith regard to the political situation in Germany, I'll let more informed individuals offer up their own analysis of the political situation in Germany. But what I will just say as a general matter is that one of the things that makes the alliance between the United States and Germany so strong is our shared values and our shared commitment to those values. And those values include protecting innocent civilians and offering humanitarian relief to those in need, and not treating people differently just because of their religion. And those values are not unique to the United States and Germany, but our shared, deep commitment to those values certainly strengthens our alliance.\nYes, sir, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks so much. On Turkey, Josh, a couple of questions, if I may. Just today, there are about 42 journalists -- issued arrest warrant for 42 journalists -- there's another warrant for arrest for another 19 journalists. These are the only reported warrants, and there are many other across Turkey. A crackdown goes on. It has been 10 days since the coup attempt failed. Are you watching what's going on in Turkey in terms of a government's, some call purge, some other call crackdown after the coup?\nMR. EARNEST: President Obama was asked about this on Friday, and I think the President spoke quite directly about the situation in Turkey. I think it should be evident from his response that it's not just that the United States government is closely following the situation in Turkey. President Obama is personally following the situation in Turkey quite closely.\nTurkey is an important ally of the United States. And there's a reason that the United States was one of the first countries around the world to issue our own swift condemnation of the coup attempt in Turkey. The United States values our alliance and certainly deeply respects the democratic traditions inside of Turkey. And when President Obama had an opportunity to speak with President Erdogan on the telephone last week, President Obama conveyed his view that Turkish democratic institutions are worth protecting. It's those very institutions and traditions that were critical to repelling the coup in the first place.\nAnd there's strong support among the Turkish people and within the Turkish government for those democratic institutions. In fact, in the midst of the coup, you saw the parties in the Turkish parliament come forward issuing their own sweeping condemnation of the coup attempt, even though some of those parties have vigorous political disagreements with President Erdogan.\nSo these kinds of democratic institutions and traditions, the democratic values that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution are all worth protecting. And even as the Turkish government conducts the kind of investigation that's necessary to get to the bottom of what happened in the context of the failed coup, it's also important for them to keep in mind that those democratic institutions were instrumental from preventing the coup from succeeding.\nQ: Do you think that these many journalists being detained or arrested, is it justified?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, freedom of the press is one of the rights that's enshrined in the Turkish constitution. And President Obama on more than one occasion has had a conversation with President Erdogan about the United States' own view and the U.S. government's own view that protecting those rights is important. And the President certainly has conveyed that to President Erdogan in the past, even before the coup took place.\nSo the United States' commitment to those values and those principles, including the freedom of the press, is rock solid. And we certainly have -- well, I'll just say, President Obama has certainly conveyed our rock-solid commitment to those issues to President Erdogan in the hopes that he'll demonstrate a similar commitment to them.\nQ: So you think it's not justified? Can you --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I can't from here render a judgment on that. But President Obama made clear that he's personally watching the situation closely. U.S. officials continue to be in close touch with their Turkish counterparts, and we certainly believe that it's important, even as the Turkish government goes to great lengths to determine what exactly happened in the context of the failed coup -- and to bring some accountability to those who may have been complicit in that effort -- that it's critically important that the Turkish government not also undermine the very democratic institutions that, ostensibly, they're trying to protect.\nQ: In the same press conference, President Obama last week stated that some of the rumors \"that the U.S. involved\" about coup would threaten critical alliance between Turkey and U.S. Yet over the weekend, Turkish Justice Minister said that however knows his name is Obama and U.S. also knows that it is behind the coup. This came from justice minister. And today, very staunch pro-government newspaper headline accusing the former General Campbell is behind the coup -- who operated and coordinated the coup from Turkey -- visiting Turkey several times in recent months -- with a picture and the name. Do you think your message has been listened to in Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the allegation against General Campbell is baseless and barely worth a response. President Obama was, to use his word, unequivocal in the East Room about the United States and our strong commitment to our alliance with Turkey.\nThe President was unequivocal in his condemnation of the attempt by some members of the military to overthrow the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. There's some pretty good evidence to indicate that we mean what we saw. The United States was among the first countries to issue a statement critical of the failed coup attempt.\nSo President Obama can obviously speak to this more authoritatively than I can, and he did, as recently as last Friday in saying that the United States was, of course, not just not involved in the coup attempt but rather was and has been critical of the failed coup attempt and strongly supportive of the democratically elected government of Turkey.\nQ: Final question. There is an Amnesty International report saying that there is credible evidence of torture, including rape, applied to detainees -- over 10,000 people so far have been detained. Have you seen the report? Do you have a comment on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I've been briefed on the report. What I can tell you is that there are important democratic institutions and traditions inside of Turkey that are worth protecting. There are rights enshrined in Turkey's constitution that are worth protecting. These basic human rights are an important part of the alliance between the United States and Turkey -- both the United States and Turkey are strongly committed to those universal human rights and strongly committed to protecting those universal human rights.\nAnd it's important, even as Turkey conducts an investigation to determine who may have been responsible for the failed coup attempt, that they protect those basic human rights moving forward. And that is something that President Obama has conveyed directly in private to President Erdogan. It's something that President Obama discussed publicly yesterday -- or on Friday in his news conferences. And it's something I anticipate that the administration will continue to watch closely moving forward.\nQ: Turkey suspended the human rights convention, so it is not bound to it. And also there is a state of emergency in Turkey right now. So you have been mentioning the (inaudible) suspend in Turkey.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what also happened in Turkey, as you pointed out, was just 10 days ago there was an attempt by some members of the military to overthrow the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. So it's understandable that the Turkish government and the Turkish people would be interested in a full investigation and in some accountability.\nSo the situation in Turkey is tense. People are understandably on edge. But what is clear is that it's important for Turkey's government to protect the kinds of democratic institutions and traditions that Turkey has long stood for you. Ostensibly, that is what the government is protecting -- is the Turkish democracy. And as they protect the Turkish democracy, it's important that they are protective of the principles that form the foundation of that democracy.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:22 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-07-25", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

This means fostering fair competition among insurers, and throughout the health care industry, to reduce premium and out-of-pocket costs that are too much of a burden for working families. Too often, hardworking Americans are facing sky-high costs while insurance companies see growing profits.\nThat's why today, Hillary for America welcomes the Department of Justice's decision to sue to block two large health insurance mergers: that of Aetna and Humana, as well as that of Cigna and Anthem. Today, Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Ann O'Leary stated,\n\"We applaud the Department of Justice's decision to sue to block the Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna mergers. When these deals were first announced last year, Hillary Clinton called for careful scrutiny and said that she was 'very skeptical of the claim that consumers will benefit from them.' Now, the Department of Justice has reached the same conclusion. Hillary will continue to fight to reduce health costs and strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent corporations from gaining too much market power at the expense of fair competition and harming hard-working Americans and consumers. She will also work to strengthen the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act so that more families have access to even more plans with lower premiums and out of pocket costs.\"\nThroughout this campaign, Hillary has taken a strong stand against excessive corporate concentration – a stance that is increasingly shared by leaders throughout the party, and reflected in a strong statement in the party's platform. Hillary believes it's good for our economy when companies prosper by innovating, creating new products, and investing in their workers. But in too many instances, that's not what's happening. Large corporations are concentrating control over markets – and rather than offering better products for lower prices, they are using their power to raise prices, limit choices for consumers, lower wages for workers, and hold back competition from startups and small businesses.\nAs President, Hillary will take on corporate concentration. She will bolster antitrust enforcement, appoint regulators who will aggressively enforce the laws we have on the books against anticompetitive practices and mergers, strengthen these laws where necessary, and build on the President's recent Executive Order to increase competition and take on concentration administration-wide. Hillary's belief that we need to empower Americans when businesses, including insurance companies, unfairly try to take advantage of them is at the heart of her work. She will continue to call on insurance companies to \"commit to passing on savings and efficiencies to consumers as lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs,\" which is just part of her overall plan to reduce health care costs. In a Hillary Clinton Administration, the executive branch will protect hardworking Americans, not companies concentrating power.", "timestamp": "2016-07-25", "title": "Hillary for America's Statement on the DOJ Lawsuit Against Health Insurance Mergers"}

You know, it's hard to believe that it has been eight years since I first came to this convention to talk with you about why I thought my husband should be President. (Applause.) Remember how I told you about his character and conviction, his decency and his grace -– the traits that we've seen every day that he's served our country in the White House.\nI also told you about our daughters –- how they are the heart of our hearts, the center of our world. And during our time in the White House, we've had the joy of watching them grow from bubbly little girls into poised young women -– a journey that started soon after we arrived in Washington, when they set off for their first day at their new school.\nI will never forget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just seven and ten years old, pile into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns. (Laughter.) And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only thing I could think was, \"What have we done?\" (Laughter.) See, because at that moment, I realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them.\nThat is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight -- how we urge them to ignore those who question their father's citizenship or faith. (Applause.) How we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. (Applause.) How we explain that when someone is cruel, or acts like a bully, you don't stoop to their level -– no, our motto is, when they go low, we go high. (Applause.)\nWith every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us. We as parents are their most important role models. And let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as President and First Lady, because we know that our words and actions matter not just to our girls, but to children across this country –- kids who tell us, \"I saw you on TV, I wrote a report on you for school.\" Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband, his eyes wide with hope, and he wondered, \"Is my hair like yours?\" (Applause.)\nAnd make no mistake about it, this November, when we go to the polls, that is what we're deciding -– not Democrat or Republican, not left or right. No, this election, and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives. (Applause.) And I am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be President of the United States, and that is our friend, Hillary Clinton. (Applause.)\nSee, I trust Hillary to lead this country because I've seen her lifelong devotion to our nation's children –- not just her own daughter, who she has raised to perfection –- (applause) -- but every child who needs a champion: Kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs. Kids who wonder how they'll ever afford college. Kids whose parents don't speak a word of English but dream of a better life. Kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be.\nYou see, Hillary has spent decades doing the relentless, thankless work to actually make a difference in their lives -- (applause) -- advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer. Fighting for children's health care as First Lady and for quality child care in the Senate. And when she didn't win the nomination eight years ago, she didn't get angry or disillusioned. (Applause.) Hillary did not pack up and go home. Because as a true public servant, Hillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointments. (Applause.) So she proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as Secretary of State, traveling the globe to keep our kids safe.\nAnd look, there were plenty of moments when Hillary could have decided that this work was too hard, that the price of public service was too high, that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how she talks or even how she laughs. But here's the thing -- what I admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure. (Applause.) She never takes the easy way out. And Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life. (Applause.)\nAnd when I think about the kind of President that I want for my girls and all our children, that's what I want. I want someone with the proven strength to persevere. Someone who knows this job and takes it seriously. Someone who understands that the issues a President faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters. (Applause.) Because when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command, you can't make snap decisions. You can't have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out. You need to be steady, and measured, and well-informed. (Applause.)\nI want a President with a record of public service, someone whose life's work shows our children that we don't chase fame and fortune for ourselves, we fight to give everyone a chance to succeed -- (applause) -- and we give back, even when we're struggling ourselves, because we know that there is always someone worse off, and there but for the grace of God go I. (Applause.)\nI want a President who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters –- a President who truly believes in the vision that our founders put forth all those years ago: That we are all created equal, each a beloved part of the great American story. (Applause.) And when crisis hits, we don't turn against each other -– no, we listen to each other. We lean on each other. Because we are always stronger together. (Applause.)\nAnd I am here tonight because I know that that is the kind of president that Hillary Clinton will be. And that's why, in this election, I'm with her. (Applause.)\nYou see, Hillary understands that the President is about one thing and one thing only -– it's about leaving something better for our kids. That's how we've always moved this country forward –- by all of us coming together on behalf of our children -- folks who volunteer to coach that team, to teach that Sunday school class because they know it takes a village. Heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their lives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty.\nPolice officers and protestors in Dallas who all desperately want to keep our children safe. (Applause.) People who lined up in Orlando to donate blood because it could have been their son, their daughter in that club. (Applause.) Leaders like Tim Kaine -- (applause) -- who show our kids what decency and devotion look like. Leaders like Hillary Clinton, who has the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling until she finally breaks through, lifting all of us along with her. (Applause.)\nThat is the story of this country, the story that has brought me to this stage tonight, the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves -- (applause) -- and I watch my daughters –- two beautiful, intelligent, black young women –- playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. (Applause.) And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters –- and all our sons and daughters -– now take for granted that a woman can be President of the United States. (Applause.)\nSo don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this, right now, is the greatest country on earth. (Applause.) And as my daughters prepare to set out into the world, I want a leader who is worthy of that truth, a leader who is worthy of my girls' promise and all our kids' promise, a leader who will be guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children.\nSo in this election, we cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best. We cannot afford to be tired, or frustrated, or cynical. No, hear me -- between now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago: We need to knock on every door. We need to get out every vote. We need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing Hillary Clinton as President of the United States of America.\nLet's get to work.

Fueled by a chorus of voices who refused to accept a second-class status and driven by a movement that recognized that our country is stronger and more vibrant when we draw on the talents of all our people, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) enshrined into law the notion that Americans living with disabilities deserve to participate in our society free from discrimination. Twenty-six years later, as we mark this anniversary, we recognize all this milestone law has made possible for the disability community.\nThe ADA sought to guarantee that the places we share—from schools and workplaces to stadiums and parks—truly belong to everyone. It reflects our Nation's full commitment to the rights and independence of people with disabilities, and it has paved the way for a more inclusive and equal society. For the 6.5 million students and the approximately 50 million adults living with mental or physical disabilities, the ADA has swung open doors and empowered each of them to make of their lives what they will.\nBuilding on this progress is a priority for my Administration. The Federal Government has taken the lead in creating meaningful employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In my first term, I issued an Executive Order that called on Federal agencies and contractors to hire more people with disabilities—and today, more Americans with disabilities are working in Federal service than at any time in the last three decades. My Administration has vigorously enforced the Supreme Court's ruling in the Olmstead decision—which determined that, under the ADA, people with disabilities cannot be unnecessarily segregated—and worked to deliver on the promise that individuals with disabilities have access to integrated, community-based services. The Affordable Care Act affirmed that Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health insurance, and this year, we made it clear that health care providers must offer reasonable accommodations and ensure effective communication for individuals with disabilities in order to advance health equity and reduce health care disparities.\nAs we commemorate this progress, we know our work to expand opportunity and confront the stigma that persists surrounding disabilities is not yet finished: We have to address the injustices that linger and remove the barriers that remain. Too many people with disabilities are still unemployed and lack access to skills training or are not paid fairly for their work. We must continue increasing graduation rates for students with disabilities to give them every chance to receive the education and training they need to pursue their dreams. We must make the information and communication technologies we rely on accessible for all people, and ensure their needs are considered and incorporated as we advance the tools of modern life. And we must keep fighting for more consistent and effective enforcement of the ADA in order to prevent discrimination in public services and accommodations.\nAt a time when so many doubted that people with disabilities could contribute to our economy or support their families, the ADA assumed they could, and guided the way forward. Today, as we reflect on the courage and commitment of all who made this achievement possible, let us renew our obligation to extend the promise of the American dream to all our people, and let us recommit to building a world free of unnecessary barriers and full of deeper understanding of those living with disabilities.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2016, the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I encourage Americans across our Nation to celebrate the 26th anniversary of this civil rights law and the many contributions of individuals with disabilities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-07-25", "title": "Proclamation 9471—Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2016"}

Over the course of 3 years, through unforgiving weather and severe danger, nearly 1.8 million Americans joined in the fight and faced down Communism—pushing the invading armies back and protecting a people on the other side of the world. As we mark the 63rd anniversary of the Military Armistice Agreement that brought an end to this war, we pause to honor the strength and resilience of our Korean War veterans, whose spirits and stories serve as an inspiration to continue advancing freedom's cause.\nRising from occupation and ruin, the Republic of Korea today shines as a thriving, modern country, whose people can take comfort in knowing that the commitment of the United States to their stability and security will never waver. Fifty million South Koreans now live in freedom, reaching for their dreams and pursuing opportunities in a vibrant democracy and dynamic economy—always realizing they have a partner who will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in defense of peace and prosperity. Our lasting friendship and unbreakable alliance are sustained by the beliefs we hold in common and the values we cherish.\nAs we pay tribute to the Americans who gallantly helped forge this bond, we know our solemn responsibilities to our fallen and their loved ones persist long after the battle ends. More than 7,800 Americans are still missing from the Korean War, and we will not stop working to live up to our obligations to their families. We owe all our service members an enormous debt of gratitude. To honor the full weight of the sacrifices made by those who serve, we must uphold our Nation's promise to our veterans when they return home, and fulfill our commitment to all who wear the uniform in our name.\nOn National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we pay tribute to the American patriots who fought for freedom and democracy throughout the Korean War, leaving behind everyone they loved to secure the blessings of liberty for a country they never knew and a people they had never met. For the heavy price they paid, we will forever honor the legacy of their service and uphold the ideals they secured through this hard-won victory.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2016, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day.

She had thick blond hair, big glasses, wore no makeup, and she had a sense of strength and self-possession that I found magnetic. After the class I followed her out, intending to introduce myself. I got close enough to touch her back, but I couldn't do it. Somehow I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn't stop.\nAnd I saw her several more times in the next few days, but I still didn't speak to her. Then one night I was in the law library talking to a classmate who wanted me to join the Yale Law Journal. He said it would guarantee me a job in a big firm or a clerkship with a federal judge. I really wasn't interested, I just wanted to go home to Arkansas. [applause]\nThen I saw the girl again, standing at the opposite end of that long room. Finally she was staring back at me, so I watched her. She closed her book, put it down and started walking toward me. She walked the whole length of the library, came up to me and said, look, if you're going to keep staring at me...[laughter]...and now I'm staring back, we at least ought to know each other's name. I'm Hillary Rodham, who are you? [applause]\nI was so impressed and surprised that, whether you believe it or not, momentarily I was speechless. [laughter and applause]\nFinally, I sort of blurted out my name and we exchanged a few words and then she went away.\nWell, I didn't join the Law Review, but I did leave that library with a whole new goal in mind. [laughter]\nA couple of days later, I saw her again. I remember, she was wearing a long, white, flowery skirt. And I went up to her and she said she was going to register for classes for the next term. And I said I'd go, too. And we stood in line and talked — you had to do that to register back then — and I thought I was doing pretty well until we got to the front of the line and the registrar looked up and said, Bill, what are you doing here, you registered morning? [laughter]\nI turned red and she laughed that big laugh of hers. And I thought, well, heck, since my cover's been blown I just went ahead and asked her to take a walk down to the art museum.\nWe've been walking and talking and laughing together ever since. [applause]\nAnd we've done it in good times and bad, through joy and heartbreak. We cried together this morning on the news that our good friend and a lot of your good friend, Mark Weiner, passed away early this morning.\nWe've built up a lifetime of memories. After the first month and that first walk, I actually drove her home to Park Ridge, Illinois...[applause]...to meet her family and see the town where she grew up, a perfect example of post World War II middle-class America, street after street of nice houses, great schools, good parks, a big public swimming pool, and almost all white.\nI really liked her family. Her crusty, conservative father, her rambunctious brothers, all extolling the virtues of rooting for the Bears and the Cuba. [applause]\nAnd for the people from Illinois here, they even told me what \"waiting for next year\" meant. [laughter]\nIt could be next year, guys.\nNow, her mother was different. She was more liberal than the boys. And she had a childhood that made mine look like a piece of cake. She was easy to underestimate with her soft manner and she reminded me all over again of the truth of that old saying you should never judge a book by its covers. Knowing her was one of the greatest gifts Hillary ever gave me. [applause]\nI learned that Hillary got her introduction to social justice through her Methodist youth minister, Don Jones. He took her downtown to Chicago to hear Dr. Martin Luther King speak and he remained her friend for the rest of his life. This will be the only campaign of hers he ever missed.\nWhen she got to college, her support for civil rights, her opposition to the Vietnam War compelled her to change party, to become a Democrat. [applause]\nAnd then between college and law school on a total lark she went alone to Alaska and spent some time sliming fish. [applause]\nMore to the point, by the time I met her she had already been involved in the law school's legal services project and she had been influenced by Marian Wright Edelman. [applause]\nShe took a summer internship interviewing workers in migrant camps for Senator Walter Mondale's subcommittee. [applause]\nShe had also begun working in the Yale New Haven Hospital to develop procedures to handle suspected child abuse cases. She got so involved in children's issues that she actually took an extra year in law school working at the child studies center to learn what more could be done to improve the lives and the futures of poor children. [applause]\nSo she was already determined to figure out how to make things better.\nHillary opened my eyes to a whole new world of public service by private citizens. In the summer of 1972, she went to Dothan, Alabama to visit one of those segregated academies that then enrolled over half-a-million white kids in the South. The only way the economics worked is if they claimed federal tax exemptions to which they were not legally entitled. She got sent to prove they weren't.\nSo she sauntered into one of these academies all by herself, pretending to be a housewife that had just moved to town and needed to find a school for her son. And they exchanged pleasantries and finally she said, look, let's just get to the bottom line here, if I enroll my son in this school will he be in a segregated school, yes or know? And the guy said absolutely. She had him! [laughter]\nI've seen it a thousand times since. And she went back and her encounter was part of a report that gave Marian Marian Wright Edelman the ammunition she needed to keep working to force the Nixon administration to take those tax exemptions away and give our kids access to an equal education. [applause]\nThen she went down to south Texas where she met...[applause]...she met one of the nicest fellows I ever met, the wonderful union leader Franklin Garcia, and he helped her register Mexican-American voters. I think some of them are still around to vote for her in 2016. [applause]\nThen in our last year in law school, Hillary kept up this work. She went to South Carolina to see why so many young...[applause]...she went to South Carolina to see why so many young African-American boys, I mean, young teenagers, were being jailed for years with adults in men's prisons. And she filed a report on that, which led to some changes, too. Always making things better. [applause]\nNow, meanwhile, let's get back to business. I was trying to convince her to marry me. [laughter]\nI first proposed to her on a trip to Great Britain, the first time she had been overseas. And we were on the shoreline of this wonderful little lake, Lake Ennerdale. I asked her to marry me and she said I can't do it. [laughter]\nSo in 1974 I went home to teach in the law school and Hillary moved to Massachusetts...[applause]...to keep working on children's issues. This time trying to figure out why so many kids counted in the Census weren't enrolled in school. She found one of them sitting alone on her porch in a wheelchair. Once more, she filed a report about these kids, and that helped influence ultimately the Congress to adopt the proposition that children with disabilities, physical or otherwise, should have equal access to public education. [applause]\nYou saw the results of that last night when Anastasia Somoza talked. [applause]\nShe never made fun of people with disabilities; she tried to empower them based on their abilities. [applause]\nMeanwhile, I was still trying to get her to marry me. [laughter]\nSo the second time I tried a different tack. I said I really want you to marry me, but you shouldn't do it. [laughter]\nAnd she smiled and looked at me, like, what is this boy up to? She said that is not a very good sales pitch. I said I know, but it's true. And I meant it, it was true.\nI said I know most of the young Democrats our age who want to go into politics, they mean well and they speak well, but none of them is as good as you are at actually doing things to make positive changes in people's lives. [applause]\nSo I suggested she go home to Illinois or move to New York and look for a chance to run for office. She just laughed and said, are you out of you mind, nobody would ever vote for me. [laughter]\nSo I finally got her to visit me in Arkansas. [applause]\nAnd when she did, the people at the law school were so impressed they offered a teaching position. And she decided to take a huge chance. She moved to a strange place, more rural, more culturally conservative than anyplace she had ever been, where she knew good and well people would wonder what in the world she was like and whether they could or should accept her.\nDidn't take them long to find out what she was like. She loved her teaching and she got frustrated when one of her students said, well, what do you expect, I'm just from Arkansas. She said, don't tell me that, you're as smart as anybody, you've just got to believe in yourself and work hard and set high goals. She believed that anybody could make it. [applause]\nShe also started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas, providing legal aid services to poor people who couldn't pay for them. And one day I was driving her to the airport to fly back to Chicago when we passed this little brick house that had a for sale sign on it. And she said, boy, that's a pretty house. It had 1,100 square feet, an attic, fan and no air conditioner in hot Arkansas, and a screened-in porch.\nHillary commented on what a uniquely designed and beautiful house it was. So I took a big chance. I bought the house. My mortgage was $175 a month. [laughter]\nWhen she came back, I picked up her up and I said, you remember that house you liked? She said yeah. I said, while you were gone I bought it, you have to marry me now. [laughter]\nThe third time was the charm. [applause]\nWe were married in that little house on October the 11th, 1975. I married my best friend. I was still in awe after more than four years of being around her at how smart and strong and loving and caring she was. And I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret.\nA little over a year later we moved to Little Rock when I became attorney general and she joined the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi. Soon after, she started a group called the Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children. [cheering]\nIt's a group, as you can hear, is still active today. [applause]\nIn 1979, just after I became governor, I asked Hillary to chair a rural health committee to help expand health care to isolated farm and mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide. It was a big deal then, highly controversial and very important.\nAnd I got the feeling that what she did for the rest of her life she was doing there. She just went out and figured out what needed to be done and what made the most sense and what would help the most people. And then if it was controversial she'd just try to persuade people it was the right thing to do. [applause]\nIt wasn't the only big thing that happened that spring my first year as governor. We found out we were going to be parents. [applause]\nAnd time passed. On February 27th, 1980, 15 minutes after I got home from the National Governors Conference in Washington, Hillary's water broke and off we went to the hospital. Chelsea was born just before midnight. [applause]\nAnd it was the greatest moment of my life. The miracle of a new beginning. The hole it filled for me because my own father died before I was born, and the absolute conviction that my daughter had the best mother in the whole world. [applause]\nFor the next 17 years, through nursing school, Montessori, kindergarten, through T-ball, softball, soccer, volleyball and her passion for ballet, through sleepovers, summer camps, family vacations and Chelsea's own very ambitious excursions, from Halloween parties in the neighborhood, to a Viennese waltz gala in the White House, Hillary first and foremost was a mother.\nShe became, as she often said, our family's designated worrier, born with an extra responsibility gene. The truth is we rarely disagreed on parenting, although she did believe that I had gone a little over the top when I took a couple of days off with Chelsea to watch all six \"Police Academy\" movies back-to-back. [laughter]\nWhen Chelsea was 9 months old, I was defeated for reelection in the Reagan landslide. And I became overnight, I think, the youngest former governor in the history of the country. We only had two-year terms back then.\nHillary was great. Immediately she said, OK, what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do, we're going to get a house, you're going to get a job, we're going to enjoy being Chelsea's parents. And if you really want to run again, you've got to go out and talk to people and figure out why you lost, tell people you got the message and show them you've still got good ideas.\nI followed her advice. Within two days we had a house, I soon had a job. We had two fabulous years with Chelsea. And in 1982, I became the first governor in the history of our state to be elected, defeated and elected again. [applause]\nI think my experience is it's a pretty good thing to follow her advice. The rest of the decade sort of flew by as our lives settled into a rhythm of family and work and friends.\nIn 1983, Hillary chaired a committee to recommend new education standards for us as a part of and in response to a court order to equalize school funding and a report by a national expert that said our woefully underfunded schools were the worst in America.\nTypical Hillary, she held listening tours in all 75 counties with our committee. She came up with really ambitious recommendations. For example, that we be the first state in America to require elementary counselors in every school because so many kids were having trouble at home and they needed it. [applause]\nSo I called the legislature into session hoping to pass the standards, pass a pay raise for teachers and raise the sales tax to pay for it all. I knew it would be hard to pass, but it got easier after Hillary testified before the education committee and the chairman, a plainspoken farmer, said looks to me like we elected the wrong Clinton.\n[laughter and applause]\nWell, by the time I ran for president nine years later, the same expert who said that we had the worst schools in America said that our state was one of the two most improved states in America. And that's because of those standards that Hillary developed. [applause] Now, two years later, Hillary told me about a preschool program developed in Israel called HIPPY, Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. The idea was to teach low-income parents, even those that couldn't read, to be their children's first teachers.\nShe said she thought it would work in Arkansas. I said that's great, what are we going to do about it? She said, oh, I already did it. I called the woman who started the program in Israel, she'll be here in about 10 days and help us get started.\nNext thing you know I'm being dragged around to all these little preschool graduations. Now, keep in mind, this was before any state even had universal kindergarten and I'm being dragged to preschool graduations watching these poor parents with tears in their eyes because they never thought they'd be able to help their kids learn. [applause]\nNow, 20 years of research has shown how well this program works to improve readiness for school and academic achievement. There are a lot of young adults in America who have no idea Hillary had anything to do with it who are enjoying better lives because they were in that program.\nShe did all this while being a full-time worker, a mother and enjoying our life. Why? Well, she's insatiably curious, she's a natural leader, she's a good organizer, and she's the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life. [applause]\nLook, this is a really important point. This is a really important point for you to take out of this convention. If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many people's lives are better, you know it's hard and some people think it's boring. Speeches like this are fun.\n[laughter]\nActually doing the work is hard. So people say, well, we need to change. She's been around a long time, she sure has, and she's sure been worth every single year she's put into making people's lives better. [applause]\nI can tell you this. If you were sitting where I'm sitting and you heard what I have heard at every dinner conversation, every lunch conversation, on every lone walk, you would say this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is. [applause]\nWhen I became president with a commitment to reform health care, Hillary was a natural to head the health care task force. You all know we failed because we couldn't break a Senate filibuster. Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one. The most important goal was to get more children with health insurance. [applause]\nIn 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids. There are a lot of other things in that bill that she got done piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.\nIn 1997, she also teamed with the House Minority Leader Tom DeLay, who maybe disliked me more than any of Newt Gingrich's crowd. They worked on a bill together to increase adoptions of children under foster care. She wanted to do it because she knew that Tom DeLay, for all of our differences, was an adoptive parent and she honored him for doing that. [applause]\nNow, the bill they worked on, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, led to a big increase in the adoption of children out of foster care, including non-infant kids and special-needs kids. It made life better because she's a change-maker, that's what she does. [applause]\nNow, when you're doing all this, real life doesn't stop. 1997 was the year Chelsea finished high school and went to college. We were happy for her, but sad for us to see her go. I'll never forget moving her into her dorm room at Stanford. It would have been a great little reality flick. There I was in a trance just staring out the window trying not to cry, and there was Hillary on her hands and knees desperately looking for one more drawer to put that liner paper in.\n[laughter]\nFinally, Chelsea took charge and told us ever so gently that it was time for us to go. So we closed a big chapter in the most important work of our lives. As you'll see Thursday night when Chelsea speaks, Hillary's done a pretty fine job of being a mother. [applause]\nAnd as you saw last night, beyond a shadow of a doubt so has Michelle Obama. [applause]\nNow, fast forward. In 1999, Congressman Charlie Rangel and other New York Democrats urged Hillary...[applause]...urged Hillary to run for the seat of retiring Senator Pat Moynihan. We had always intended to go to New York after I left office and commute to Arkansas, but this had never occurred to either one of us. Hillary had never run for office before, but she decided to give it a try.\nShe began her campaign the way she always does new things, by listening and and learning. And after a tough battle, New York elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy. [applause]\nAnd she didn't let him down. Her early years were dominated by 9/11, by working to fund the recovery, then monitoring the health and providing compensation to victims and first and second responders. She and Senator Schumer were tireless and so were our House members.\nIn 2003, partly spurred on by what we were going through, she became the first senator in the history of New York ever to serve on the Armed Services Committee. [applause]\nSo she tried to make sure people on the battlefield had proper equipment. She tried to expand and did expand health care coverage to Reservists and members of the National Guard. She got longer family leave, working with Senator Dodd, for people caring for wounded service members.\nAnd she worked for more extensive care for people with traumatic brain injury. She also served on a special Pentagon commission to propose changes necessary to meet our new security challenges. Newt Gingrich was on that commission, he told me what a good job she had done. [applause]\nI say that because nobody who has seriously dealt with the men and women in today's military believes they are a disaster. They are a national treasure of all races, all religions, all walks of life. [applause]\nNow, meanwhile, she compiled a really solid record, totally progressive on economic and social issues. She voted for and against some proposed trade deals. She became the de facto economic development officer for the area of New York outside the ambit of New York City.\nShe worked for farmers, for winemakers, for small businesses and manufacturers, for upstate cities in rural areas who needed more ideas and more new investment to create good jobs, something we have to do again in small-town and rural America, in neighborhoods that have been left behind in our cities and Indian country and, yes, in coal country. [applause]\nWhen she lost a hard-fought contest to President Obama in 2008, she worked for his election hard. But she hesitated to say yes when he asked her to join his Cabinet because she so loved being a senator from New York.\nSo like me, in a different context, he had to keep asking. [laughter]\nBut as we all saw and heard from Madeleine Albright, it was worth the effort and worth the wait. [applause] As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. And in what The Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them. Her team negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and reestablish inspections. And she got enough Republican support to get two-thirds of the Senate, the vote necessary to ratify the treaty. [applause]\nShe flew all night long from Cambodia to the Middle East to get a cease-fire that would avoid a full-out shooting war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza to protect the peace of the region.\nShe backed President Obama's decision to go after Osama bin Laden. [applause]\nShe launched a team, this is really important today, she launched a team to fight back against terrorists online and built a new global counterterrorism effort.\nWe've got to win this battle in the mind field.\nShe put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. [applause]\nShe negotiated the first agreement ever — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions. And as she had been doing since she went to Beijing in 1995 and said women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights...[applause]...she worked to empower women and girls around the world and to make the same exact declaration on behalf of the LGBT community in America and around the world. [applause]\nAnd nobody ever talks about this much, nobody ever talks about this much, but it's important to me. She tripled the number of people with AIDS in poor countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars, most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives and it didn't cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs, something we need to do for the American people more. [applause]\nNow, you don't know any of these people. You don't know any of those 3.4 million people, but I'll guarantee you they know you. They know you because they see you as thinking their lives matter. They know you and that's one reason the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it. [applause]\nNow, how does this square? How did this square with the things that you heard at the Republican convention? What's the difference in what I told you and what they said? How do you square it? You can't. One is real, the other is made up.\nYou just have to decide. You just have to decide which is which, my fellow Americans.\nThe real one had done more positive change-making before she was 30 than many public officials do in a lifetime in office. [applause]\nThe real one, if you saw her friend Betsy Ebeling vote for Illinois today...[applause]...has friends from childhood through Arkansas, where she has not lived in more than 20 years, who have gone all across America at their own expense to fight for the person they know. [applause]\nThe real one has earned the loyalty, the respect and the fervent support of people who have worked with her in every stage of her life, including leaders around the world who know her to be able, straightforward and completely trustworthy.\nThe real one calls you when you're sick, when your kid's in trouble or when there's a death in the family.\nThe real one repeatedly drew praise from prominent Republicans when she was a senator and secretary of state. [applause]\nSo what's up with it? Well, if you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a two-car parade...[laughter]...a real change-maker represents a real threat. [applause]\nSo your only option is to create a cartoon, a cartoon alternative, then run against the cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional, they're easy to absorb. Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard. And a lot of people even think it's boring. [applause]\nGood for you, because earlier today you nominated the real one. [applause]\nListen, we've got to get back on schedule. You guys calm down.\nLook, I have lived a long, full, blessed life, it really took off when I met and fell in love with that girl in the spring of 1971. When I was president, I worked hard to give you more peace and shared prosperity, to give you an America where nobody is invisible or counted out. [applause]\nBut for this time, Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face. And she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known. [applause]\nYou could drop her into any trouble spot, pick one, come back in a month and somehow, some way she will have made it better. That is just who she is. [applause]\nThere are clear, achievable, affordable responses to our challenges. But we won't get to them if America makes the wrong choice in this election. That's why you should elect her. And you should elect her because she'll never quit when the going gets tough. She'll never quit on you.\nShe sent me in this primary to West Virginia where she knew we were going to lose, to look those coal miners in the eye and say I'm down here because Hillary sent me to tell you that if you really think you can get the economy back you had 50 years ago, have at it, vote for whoever you want to. But if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you along on the ride to America's future. [applause]\nAnd so I say to you, if you love this country, you're working hard, you're paying taxes and you're obeying the law and you'd like to become a citizen, you should choose immigration reform over somebody that wants to send you back. [applause] If you're a Muslim and you love America and freedom and you hate terror, stay here and help us win and make a future together. We want you. [applause]\nIf you're a young African American disillusioned and afraid, we saw in Dallas how great our police officers can be, help us build a future where nobody is afraid to walk outside, including the people that wear blue to protect our future. [applause]\nHillary will make us stronger together. You know it because she's spent a lifetime doing it. I hope you will do it. I hope you will elect her. Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to care more about our children and grandchildren. The reason you should elect her is that in the greatest country on earth we have always been about tomorrow. You children and grandchildren will bless you forever if you do.\nGod bless you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-07-26", "title": "Remarks to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118125", "text": "The new directive spells out how the Federal government will coordinate its incident response activities in the event of a large-scale cyber incident\nToday, the President approved a Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) on United States Cyber Incident Coordination. This new PPD marks a major milestone in codifying the policy that governs the Federal government's response to significant cyber incidents.\nSince the beginning of his Administration, President Obama has emphasized that malicious cyber activity poses a serious threat to the national and economic security of the United States. As set forth in the  Cybersecurity National Action Plan, over the last seven and a half years the Administration's cyber policy has been based on three strategic pillars: raising the level of cybersecurity in our public, private, and consumer sectors, in both the short and the long-term; taking steps to deter, disrupt, and interfere with malicious cyber activity aimed at the United States or its allies; and responding effectively to and recovering from cyber incidents.\nEven as we have made progress on all three pillars, the United States has been faced with managing increasingly significant cyber incidents affecting both the private sector and Federal government. We have applied the lessons learned from these events, as well as our experience in other areas such as counterterrorism and disaster response. That experience has allowed us to hone our approach but also demonstrated that significant cyber incidents demand a more coordinated, integrated, and structured response. We have also heard from the private sector the need to provide clarity and guidance about the Federal government's roles and responsibilities. The PPD builds on these lessons and institutionalizes our cyber incident coordination efforts in numerous respects, including:\n• Establishing clear principles that will govern the Federal government's activities in cyber incident response;\n• Differentiating between significant cyber incidents and steady-state incidents and applying the PPD's guidance primarily to significant incidents;\n• Categorizing the government's activities into specific lines of effort and designating a lead agency for each line of effort in the event of a significant cyber incident;\n• Creating mechanisms to coordinate the Federal government's response to significant cyber incidents, including a Cyber Unified Coordination Group similar in concept to what is used for incidents with physical effects, and enhanced coordination procedures within individual agencies;\n• Applying these policies and procedures to incidents where a Federal department or agency is the victim; and,\n• Ensuring that our cyber response activities are consistent and integrated with broader national preparedness and incident response policies, such as those implemented through  Presidential Policy Directive 8-National Preparedness, so that our response to a cyber incident can seamlessly integrate with actions taken to address physical consequences caused by malicious cyber activity.\nWe also are releasing today a cyber incident severity schema that establishes a common framework within the Federal government for evaluating and assessing the severity of cyber incidents and will help identify significant cyber incidents to which the PPD's coordination procedures would apply.\nIncident Response Principles\nThe PPD outlines five principles that will guide the Federal government during any cyber incident response:\n• Shared Responsibility - Individuals, the private sector, and government agencies have a shared vital interest and complementary roles and responsibilities in protecting the Nation from malicious cyber activity and managing cyber incidents and their consequences.\n• Risk-Based Response - The Federal government will determine its response actions and resource needs based on an assessment of the risks posed to an entity, national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.\n• Respecting Affected Entities - Federal government responders will safeguard details of the incident, as well as privacy and civil liberties, and sensitive private sector information.\n• Unity of Effort - Whichever Federal agency first becomes aware of a cyber incident will rapidly notify other relevant Federal agencies in order to facilitate a unified Federal response and ensure that the right combination of agencies responds to a particular incident.\n• Enabling Restoration and Recovery - Federal response activities will be conducted in a manner to facilitate restoration and recovery of an entity that has experienced a cyber incident, balancing investigative and national security requirements with the need to return to normal operations as quickly as possible.\nSignificant Cyber Incidents\nWhile the Federal government will adhere to the five principles in responding to any cyber incident, the PPD's policies and procedures are aimed at a particular class of cyber incident: significant cyber incidents. A significant cyber incident is one that either singularly or as part of a group of related incidents is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.\nWhen a cyber incident occurs, determining its potential severity is critical to ensuring the incident receives the appropriate level of attention. No two incidents are the same and, particularly at the initial stages, important information, including the nature of the perpetrator, may be unknown.\nTherefore, as part of the process of developing the incident response policy, the Administration also developed a common schema for describing the severity of cyber incidents, which can include credible reporting of a cyber threat, observed malicious cyber activity, or both. The schema establishes a common framework for evaluating and assessing cyber incidents to ensure that all Federal departments and agencies have a common view of the severity of a given incident, the consequent urgency of response efforts, and the need for escalation to senior levels.\nThe schema describes a cyber incident's severity from a national perspective, defining six levels, zero through five, in ascending order of severity. Each level describes the incident's potential to affect public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence. An incident that ranks at a level 3 or above on this schema is considered \"significant\" and will trigger application of the PPD's coordination mechanisms.\nLines of Effort and Lead Agencies\nTo establish accountability and enhance clarity, the PPD organizes Federal response activities into three lines of effort and establishes a Federal lead agency for each:\n• Threat response activities include the law enforcement and national security investigation of a cyber incident, including collecting evidence, linking related incidents, gathering intelligence, identifying opportunities for threat pursuit and disruption, and providing attribution. The Department of Justice, acting through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), will be the Federal lead agency for threat response activities.\n• Asset response activities include providing technical assets and assistance to mitigate vulnerabilities and reducing the impact of the incident, identifying and assessing the risk posed to other entities and mitigating those risks, and providing guidance on how to leverage Federal resources and capabilities. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acting through the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), will be the Federal lead agency for asset response activities. The PPD directs DHS to coordinate closely with the relevant Sector-Specific Agency, which will depend on what kind of organization is affected by the incident.\n• Intelligence Support and related activities include intelligence collection in support of investigative activities, and integrated analysis of threat trends and events to build situational awareness and to identify knowledge gaps, as well as the ability to degrade or mitigate adversary threat capabilities. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, will be the Federal lead agency for intelligence support and related activities.\nIn addition to these lines of effort, a victim will undertake a wide variety of response activities in order to maintain business or operational continuity in the event of a cyber incident. We recognize that for the victim, these activities may well be the most important. Such efforts can include communications with customers and the workforce; engagement with stakeholders, regulators, or oversight bodies; and recovery and reconstitution efforts. When a Federal agency is a victim of a significant cyber incident, that agency will be the lead for this fourth line of effort. In the case of a private victim, the Federal government typically will not play a role in this line of effort, but will remain cognizant of the victim's response activities consistent with these principles and coordinate with the victim.\nCoordination Architecture\nIn order to facilitate the more coordinated, integrated response demanded by significant cyber incidents, the PPD establishes a three-tiered coordination architecture for handling those incidents:\nNational Policy Level: The PPD institutionalizes the National Security Council-chaired interagency Cyber Response Group (CRG). The CRG will coordinate the development and implementation of United States Government policy and strategy with respect to significant cyber incidents affecting the United States or its interests abroad.\nNational Operational Level: The PPD directs agencies to take two actions at the national operational level in the event of a significant cyber incident.\n• Activate enhanced internal coordination procedures. The PPD instructs agencies that regularly participate in the Cyber Response Group to develop these procedures to ensure that they can surge effectively when confronted with an incident that exceeds their day-to-day operational capacity.\n• Create a Unified Coordination Group. In the event of a significant cyber incident, the PPD provides that the lead agencies for each line of effort, along with relevant Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs), state, local, tribal and territorial governments, international counterparts, and private sector entities, will form a Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG) to coordinate response activities. The Cyber UCG shall coordinate the development, prioritization, and execution of cyber response efforts, facilitate rapid information sharing among UCG members, and coordinate communications with stakeholders, including the victim entity.\nField Level: The PPD directs the lead agencies for each line of effort to coordinate their interaction with each other and with the affected entity.\nIntegration with Existing Response Policy\nThe PPD also integrates U.S. cyber incident coordination policy with key aspects of existing Federal preparedness policy to ensure that the Nation will be ready to manage incidents that include both cyber and physical effects, such as a significant power outage resulting from malicious cyber activity. The PPD will be implemented by the Federal government consistent with existing preparedness and response efforts.\nImplementation tasks\nThe PPD also directs several follow-on tasks in order to ensure its full implementation. In particular, it requires that the Administration develop and finalize the National Cyber Incident Response Plan - in coordination with State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal governments, the private sector, and the public - to further detail how the government will manage cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure. It also directs DHS and DOJ to develop a concept of operations for how a Cyber UCG will operate and for the NSC to update the charter for the CRG.", "timestamp": "2016-07-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118775", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:07 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. I don't have any announcements at the top, so, Darlene, if you want to kick it off.\nQ: Sure. The administration announced earlier today that it was going to be expanding efforts to help Central American families and children come to the U.S. legally. And I was wondering if you could speak to timing of that announcement -- today, this week -- given that the Democratic convention is going on and they're trying to put on a more -- friendlier face in terms of immigration.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, I'm happy to talk about this. As you tracked closely, Darlene, over the past year, the United States has taken a range of steps to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America. Today we announced three new steps. The first is announcing in-country processing for vulnerable populations inside El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This allows us to process requests for resettlement on the ground. That includes screening and interviews by officials from the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe second piece we announced today was that Costa Rica has announced a partnership with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to help address regional migration challenges. So what that means is populations that are unable to be processed in those three countries, we can now do that in Costa Rica.\nThe third piece we announced was the expansion of the Central American minors program. Currently, children in the three countries I just listed -- El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras -- we have programs that facilitate the resettlement into the United States for those children, and this program would -- the expansion today would expand the infrastructure that governs that program.\nAll of these have the goal of protecting Central Americans at risk while providing an orderly and safe resettlement here in the United States. In terms of the timing, what actually dictated the timing, Darlene, is our announcement with Costa Rica. This is the culmination of some negotiations with the government of Costa Rica, and as soon as that was finalized is when we decided to announce this.\nQ: A question about the convention. The President doesn't have a public schedule today. Can you sort of give us a little fill on what he's doing to prepare for his speech tomorrow night?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President is working on his speech. He was actually up late last night working on his speech. He's been working on the speech for a few weeks now. I don't have too much to preview on what to expect tomorrow night. I do think, as some of you have noted, tomorrow night will be the 12th anniversary of then-Senate-candidate Barack Obama's speech in Boston where he was introduced to the national stage. I think it's a good bet that he'll reflect on that.\nI think the President will talk about what the country has accomplished together since then, what the grit, ingenuity and determination of the American people helped to achieve over the past eight years -- whether that's coming back from the brink of economic collapse to the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history, or whether that's changing the way the world views the United States for the better.\nAs you've heard from him over the past few weeks, the President has been candid about why he thinks electing the Republican nominee is a risky path for the United States, but I would suggest to you that I think tomorrow night's speech will much more focus on how Secretary Clinton has the judgment, the toughness and the intellect to succeed in the Oval Office.\nLastly, I think the President will talk about who we are as a country and that we are better united than divided, and that we're better together than apart. I think you'll hear that as a theme, not just because it's a stark contrast between the two candidates on the ballot this year, but also because it's a principle that has animated the President's lifetime of public service. It also happens to be a distinctive American tradition, one that the President believes is fundamental to our nation's identity.\nQ: Do you have any sense of, out of all the speeches -- the big speeches he's given as President, how would he rank -- where would he rank tomorrow night's speech among those? And also, what's his plan for topping Michelle Obama? (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: She set the bar very high. I'll say a few things about that. One is the President is aware of the importance of the speech. Obviously the national conventions come around once every four years. They're a high-profile moment. And the President believes that, as he said, the stakes are high in this campaign, that the choice for voters could not be starker. And he believes that this is an opportunity for him to not only make the case for why the record of accomplishment over the past eight years should indicate that we should continue on this path and not regress, but also why Secretary Clinton is uniquely qualified to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief would have to make.\nAyesha.\nQ: So the UAW president said today that Hillary Clinton has indicated that she will try to renegotiate NAFTA if she's elected as president. I was wondering, does the administration have any response to that and this idea that NAFTA needs to be renegotiated?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, I did not work on Senator Obama's campaign in 2008, but I do know that as a candidate he pledged to renegotiate NAFTA as well. And the good news is his promise has been fulfilled. Renegotiating NAFTA is part of a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was reached earlier last year. And that's one of the reasons the President is so proud of TPP and why he believes Congress should pass it.\nSo he's acutely aware -- the President is acutely aware that previous trade agreements haven't lived up to the hype. He's acutely aware that that presents challenges for the politics of trade right now, but that's all the more reason why, when TPP was being negotiated, he insisted that we impose the strongest, most robust human rights, labor, environmental protection standards ever to be placed in a trade agreement.\nQ: But there seem to also be concerns about TPP, so it seems like people aren't necessarily taking that as a renegotiation of NAFTA. It seems like these calls on the campaign trail are a bit different. Or does the administration not see that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, our view is those with concerns about how NAFTA has been implemented should look no further than TPP as a means to fix those wrongs; that once TPP is approved through Congress, a lot of the problems that we saw in NAFTA -- which I think principally were that a lot of the trade enforcement mechanisms were not built into the agreement, rather, they were in side agreements -- TPP fixes all of that. So we believe those with concerns about how NAFTA is being implemented have a solution right in front of them, and that's passing TPP.\nQ: Today, the Cyber National Action Plan was issued. I was wondering, how would this plan prevent or affect what happened with the DNC and the emails? And under this new plan, how would the U.S. respond if it turns out that it was a foreign actor who carried out a hack or a similar -- who carried out the hack of the DNC or a similar hack if it happened in the future?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, thank you for raising the announcement today. As you know, the President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, unveiled this today in the remarks at Fordham University. I'm happy to tell you that this particular policy has been in the works for several years -- for the past year, but is the culmination of about seven or eight years of the United States government working through responses to these episodes.\nUnfortunately, they're happening all too often, and so we have a lot of practice. And what we decided to do was to build out the best practices that we've seen in terms of our ability to respond to these intrusions, and that's what the announcement today did, which was codify the best practices that we've seen. It also builds on lessons learned from natural disaster response and counterterrorism response, and so that we can write a playbook for both this administration and, to be candid, for the next administration so they don't have to recreate the wheel every time there's an intrusion.\nAs you point out, the policy largely sets forth how the federal government responds to cyber intrusions. First, the FBI will be the lead agency in responding to the immediate threat. Again, this is consistent with how terrorism cases are handled. But in the past, we know this is an important organizational distinction because it's not always clear at the outset of a cyber incident whether the actor is a nation-state or a criminal.\nBut under these new rules, the FBI will be positioned to bring the full range of law enforcement and national investigative tools to bear. That includes collecting evidence, gathering intelligence, determining attribution, and bringing malicious cyber actors to justice.\nThe second piece of this was that the Department of Homeland Security would take the lead in helping organizations and institutions deal with the impact of an attack or an intrusion. We call this asset response. I should say those who do it call it asset response. But basically what this boils down to is Department of Homeland Security will provide technical assistance to protect assets to bring the systems back up and running and to shore up vulnerabilities.\nAnd thirdly, the last piece is that the Office of Director of National Intelligence will be responsible for integrating the intelligence and analysis about the threat and identifying opportunities to mitigate and disrupt it. We are not going to look retroactively at past cases in order to see where they fall on a scale that was announced. Obviously, the DNC situation is still under investigation, so if there's a determination where on the scale that would fall, I'm sure that will be released in due time.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks. On the same subject, regardless of who orchestrated this act, even though there is some evidence pointing in a particular direction, are you treating this -- okay, let's just say that this is a state actor. Are you treating this as a state actor potentially trying to influence the 2016 election?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Michelle, I don't have any significant update today to offer on the investigation. As Josh mentioned yesterday, the FBI has made clear they're investigating this matter. Obviously, that will be a careful and thorough investigation. Josh also made clear that the FBI will be the first to release any information that they learn in the context of this investigation.\nThis was obviously the case in 2014 with the Sony hack that you all referenced yesterday. At that time, though, back in 2014, we also said that releasing an internal assessment on attribution wouldn't necessarily be the standard playbook. To the contrary, this decision will be made on a case-by-case basis, and investigators will look at two things. One is the clarity of evidence pointing to a particular culprit, and the second is whether it's in the United States' best interest to release that information or not.\nSo as you point out, I know a couple of news organizations and other voices are pointing at certain actors. From here, I'm going to have to yield to the FBI investigation.\nQ: Just speaking of that, in the past, we've named and shamed other countries, pretty obviously, but never Russia, even though some have suspected Russia, saying that there was a preponderance of the evidence to blame Russia for certain hacks. So are you saying that it's never been, then, in the U.S.'s best interest to name Russia, even though that evidence, according to some, is out there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: That's not what I'm saying, Michelle. What I'm saying is, once this investigation concludes, the investigators themselves will decide whether it's in the United States' best interest to name the culprit. And I do think that we have a long record of holding bad actors accountable for their actions in this space. We have a full range of options available to us in the government. That includes economic sanctions out of Department of Treasury. That includes a number of law enforcement measures that Department of Justice has announced and has taken action on.\nIt also includes, by the way, Department of Defense disrupting ISIL in the cyber battlefield. So we feel very confident in our capabilities. But I am going to let the FBI investigation unfold into this particular incident before we make any decisions about what we want to do in response.\nQ: But whoever did this, the timing looks pretty -- obviously as if they were trying to affect the election, no? Would you agree with that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I'm not going to characterize the motive of who conducted this attack. I do think it's likely that investigators will look at motive. I think that's reasonable to assume. But I also think it's true that the United States isn't going to pull any punches in terms of our response; that, as I've mentioned, the United States has shown -- has a record of aggressively responding in situations that warrant a response. But we are going to wait for the investigation to conclude before we make any of those determinations.\nQ: And speaking of naming, the President has been in the habit lately -- and now it seems the First Lady is, too -- of not ever saying Donald Trump's name, but there's no question who they're talking about at times. So why the aversion to actually say the name of the person they're speaking about?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Michelle, I think if you're asking about the First Lady's speech last night, I'm happy to talk about it. I know there's been plenty of commentary over the past week about the darkness of the proceedings in Cleveland, and the President said on Friday that he was struck by the dire picture painted by Republicans at their convention. And I think what made the First Lady's speech such a powerful one last night is that it was a speech that only one person could write and deliver. The country and the world watched with intense interest in 2009 when the First Family moved in the White House making history, and eight years later that family and this country has an impressive story to tell. And that's what we heard from the First Lady last night.\nThe last thing I would do -- given how remarkable that speech was -- would be to second-guess any of those word choices.\nQ: So then why doesn't the President ever say Donald Trump's name when he's speaking about him?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think you've heard the President mention the Republican nominee on occasion. I don't think he's shied away from that. And more importantly, I don't think he's shied away from making the argument of why he thinks that his election would be a risky path for the United States.\nQ: Obviously he has shied away from it. Sometimes when he's speaking publicly, he seems to go out of his way to always say \"the Republican nominee.\" And I'm just wondering why. And now that he's on the trail and will be doing other events, and he's about to give a speech at the DNC, I'm just curious, why doesn't he ever want to --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, we should both go back and look at the remarks. I'm confident that he has mentioned him before. I have some recollections of being there while he has. But I think the argument that he's making as you all pick up without hesitation is usually crystal-clear.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin.\nQ: First I just want to follow on something that Michelle was asking you about. You mentioned it's not just media speculation that Russia is responsible for the hack. Nancy Pelosi said today that there was no question. John Podesta, just very similar. So is your view here that those top allies of the White House are baselessly speculating? Or are members of the administration giving those allies information, in which case, potentially putting at risk the national security interest that you were talking about?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I heard about Leader Pelosi's remarks shortly before coming out here, and you'd have to ask her what she was basing that on. We do know that there's been a lot of analysis in the public space, making some determinations about who was behind this. A lot of that analysis is based on people with expertise and experience in this field. So you'd have to ask those who are offering a judgment about what they base that on.\nFor me, here, I have to yield to the FBI investigation because that investigation continues. We want that to be thoughtful, meticulous and unfettered. And so I'm not going to do anything from here to prejudice that investigation.\nQ: Yes, so, I mean, the administration has aggressively gone after instances where there have been leaks to reporters about ongoing national security investigations. Why wouldn't the same thing apply here, especially in what appears to be leaks or conversations, or sanctioned conversations, to top political allies of the President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, you'd have to ask them what they're basing their comments on. We know that there was one report done by a very credible entity that laid out the case for this, so it might be just based on something that's already in the public space. You should just ask them.\nQ: TPP was obviously a big theme last night. Does the White House believe Secretary Clinton when she says that she would not support TPP as President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, we take Secretary Clinton at her word, and you'll have to ask her to expound on that if you're skeptical. I think that our view is that we're at a crossroads, and that if we stipulate that the world is more interconnected than ever before, if the commercial ties between countries are strengthening and not diluting, that we have a choice -- either other countries can write the rules of the road for trade, or the American people can step up and take a leadership role.\nOur view is that the American people and the United States of America should write the rules. We know, Justin, that China is trying to negotiate its own trade deal in this region. We also know that if that deal were to be codified it would not have the labor, environmental and human rights protections that TPP has.\nSo it's going to be up to leaders of Congress, obviously, who stand to approve the deal. But our view is that not only is it in America's best interest to write the rules of the road for trade, it's in America's business interest that American companies and American workers are advantaged by the deals that we arrange.\nQ: The reason that I ask is, if you take Secretary Clinton seriously -- Donald Trump has obviously said he's against TPP. You've lost Tim Kaine now, who was (inaudible) in the Senate. You've seen Bernie Sanders rally the Democratic Party on the floor of the convention last night to block TPP in a lame duck Congress. I'm just wondering -- I know you've made the argument a million times just about why you think TPP is important, but what is the possible viable path for TPP at this point?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, I remember the same skepticism when the President was trying to get TPA past Congress, and I believe we had very much the same exchanges that were rooted -- rightfully so -- in how challenging the politics of this issue can be.\nAnd so we acknowledge that the politics here can be complicated, but we also acknowledge this is the right thing to do. And the President believes this is not only the right thing to do because we want to advantage American workers and American businesses, but also because if we don't write the rules of the road on international trade, then China is going to. And we don't believe that's in America's best interest.\nSo I understand your skepticism here. I think it's well-founded. But we had the same conversations about Trade Promotion Authority and it turns out Republicans and Democrats came together to get that done.\nQ: Last one, on the refugee announcements. The administration, I think you guys admitted, struggled when the President asked for a greater influx of Syrian refugees here -- lagged behind scheduled and needed additional resources from Congress. So I'm wondering, with this new program, if it's going to require more resources from Congress, and if you expect some of the newly eligible refugees under this program to either detract from other countries that are sending refugees our way, detract resources from vetting in other areas, or whether refugee caps are going to go up and spending on refugees is going to go up.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard an analysis that speaks to those questions. But our goal here is to conduct the resettlement process in the home countries so that we're not dealing with an influx on the border and we're not dealing with a heartbreaking or unsustainable situation that is neither safe, or orderly.\nSo our view is, let's get a lot of the process pieces done on the front end before they come to the country, and once we're assured of the security measures, then we can resettle them.\nQ: So, I mean, because federal resources are a zero-sum game, is it -- the fact that you're doing this in other countries means that the costs overall are going down, or the program isn't kind of substantial enough that it's changed -- how is this being paid for, I guess is --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, one of the streams of funding here is from the United Nations' High Commission on Refugees. They actually agreed to provide care, food and necessities for individuals housed in Costa Rica. That's again one of the new pieces of the program today.\nSo there's a variety of funding streams. We can get you more information about how it's paid for. But I haven't heard that this is going to prompt an enormous -- this is not going to require a new, enormous sum of money.\nCheryl.\nQ: Hi. I was just wondering about the speech tomorrow. You talked in general themes, but will the President be talking about specific policies like TPP, like Affordable Care Act, Wall Street reform? Or is this just going to be a thematic speech?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, first, stay tuned. And I can tell you the speech is still being worked on. So I don't really have specifics beyond some of the themes that I mentioned earlier to read out to you right now, but the President is working on the speech diligently and around the clock.\nAnd I think that what you can expect is a reflection on the past eight years in office, what the American people have gone through over the past eight years -- again, their grit, their ingenuity, their determination to come back from a very different place than we were in 2009 when this President too office. And whether he hits on the fact that health care costs are growing at the lowest pace in decades or that more Americans are graduating high school than ever before, or that we've had the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history -- we'll have to tune in.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. Can you give me an update on the fire situation in California? Has the President been in contact with the governor of the state? And what, if any, federal assistance is due for the Golden State?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. Kevin, I don't have any conversations between the President and the governor to read out to you right now. I can tell you that White House officials are in touch with their counterparts in the state of California, and they offered any assistance possible.\nAs you know, our FEMA Director, Craig Fugate, is one of the best. And so I know that the President has directed his team here at the White House to make sure that all available assets are at the disposal of local first responders in California.\nQ: And there has been no declaration of disaster, anything like that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard that they signed one.\nQ: Got you. Last night, Sarah Silverman said something interesting, she said that Bernie supporters were being \"ridiculous.\" Many of them feel like the administration has sort of turned their back on them. They feel like, in many cases, that they support a lot of the policies that the President seems to support. Is it unfair to say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on Bernie's supporters?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Kevin, I think as Josh mentioned yesterday, there's plenty of experts on the ground in Philadelphia to assess the strength and unity of the party right now. Maybe Sarah Silverman accounts herself -- is one of them.\nI would just observe Josh's theory from yesterday, which is that when the First Lady spoke to the crowd, they would be on their feet. And I certainly don't mean to knock anything that my boss says from this podium, but if anything, I think he underestimated the reception that the First Lady received. She was met with warmth, with enthusiasm, with an embrace that I think was unique for speakers at a convention like that. And I think that's not just because of her message. It's not just because she's a spectacular First Lady. It's because she represents the record of this administration and the values that drive her and her husband.\nThe other thing I'd point out is that the individual who had the most invested in defeating Secretary Clinton for the nomination could not have been more steadfast in his support the party's nominee. If you watched Senator Sanders's speech, it's clear that that wasn't just a perfunctory exercise or one that didn't come from the heart. I think you heard Senator Sanders use his trademark passion to make the case for not only the ideals which animated his campaign, but also for how the party's nominee will help achieve those goals as President.\nQ: But you also saw a three-minute-long standing ovation for a movement and a person that a great many of the people in the hall last night and presumably tonight and even into the day after feel like they have not had their voices heard. Is the White House concerned about the mood of a large portion of the party moving forward?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, the President has remarked several times how much respect he has for Senator Sanders, and in particular the strong campaign that he built. The excitement that he generated was historic. And there's no question that all of that energy, passion, and drive was on full display last night.\nAnd the good news for Democrats is that Senator Sanders committed unequivocally to ensure Secretary Clinton becomes the next President. But as the President has said, he absolutely recognizes the value that Senator Sanders brought to this race, an energy that captured the hearts and minds of millions of Americans. That's why the President is grateful that he'll be working hard to elect Secretary Clinton.\nBut we should also talk about the shared values between Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton and the President of the United States. That includes everything from building and economy from the middle class out. That includes striving hard towards social justice, civil rights, and equality. That means doing everything this country can to pass comprehensive immigration reform, to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are prone to violence. So there's a lot of shared values there. And I think you heard a lot of them on display last night. But I suspect you'll hear more about that in the coming nights.\nQ: -- know if the President has reached out to the President of France? Yet another devastating attack on humanity -- what can you tell us about the assault on a Catholic priest today in France?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, I don't have a call to read out to you from the President. But I can tell you that the United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific terrorist attack today at a Catholic church in Normandy. We offer our condolences to the family and friends of the murdered priest. And our thoughts and prayers are with the other victims of the attack, as well as the parishioners and community members of this church.\nFrance and the United States share a commitment to protecting religious liberty for those of all faiths. And today's violence will not shake that commitment. We commend French law enforcement for their quick and decisive response and stand ready to assist the French authorities in their investigation going forward.\nQ: Last one I have for you is on Afghanistan. There is a limit to the number of troops that can be there. The cap -- I believe it's 8,400 or so. Is there a concern about this cap as it relates to the folks on the ground being able to complete and do the task at hand?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, as you covered, I believe, two or three weeks ago now, we announced an adjustment in our drawdown in Afghanistan. And that was the result of analysis and feedback we have gotten from our commanders on the ground and from the rest of the President's national security team. So I don't have any new changes to announce today. But I can tell you that the President's national security team closely monitors Afghanistan, obviously, and is in constant touch with our military advisors on the ground to making sure that they're getting the support and resources they need to carry out their mission.\nQ: So is there any flexibility or fungibility in terms of the numbers if they come back to the White House and say, hey, listen, we really could use an extra thousand troops or so. Is that part of the process? Or is that not possible?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I haven't heard a request like that come through channels. Obviously, I would assume that they'd want to see how this adjustment is working out before making any new requests. But again, we're constantly making sure that the decisions the President has made in regard to American troop deployment around the world -- we're constantly making sure that those are serving the best interests of not only the troops, but also the war theaters that they're in.\nJulie.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. First on the refugee announcement. In the past when we've heard the President talk about this issue, his message has been very much one about deterrence -- don't make a difficult journey. Don't risk sending your children with smugglers -- that, in fact, these people, even if they're facing a desperate situation at home, really shouldn't be coming. And now today we're hearing that the refugee qualification process is being expanded pretty substantially. So I'm just wondering what happened to change the President's view of what's going on in Central America. Has he decided for some reason that this is a refugee situation and that he wasn't convinced it was before? What played into that decision?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Julie, I think what's happening in Central America is heartbreaking. And I think the President has voiced that consistently for a while now. There's ongoing humanitarian challenges in Central America, particularly for many vulnerable individuals attempting to leave the region and come to the United States. So it was important for us to take action to promote a safe and orderly migration.\nI think the concerns that you're referencing are concerns of the journey from Central America back to the border -- or up to the border of the United States. That journey has proved perilous, dangerous, and even deadly. And it's also done at the request and under the guise of bad actors who don't have these children's best interests in mind. They're human smugglers.\nAnd so the President's warnings about not engaging in those types of activities remain as steadfast today as they were in the past. The difference is today we're able to announce that a lot of the processing for this can happen in-country, so that we can begin to address the humanitarian crisis without making these children take a harrowing and sometimes deadly trip.\nQ: Right. But you're also opening up that process to a whole universe -- a much bigger universe of people than it was open to before. Before it was just unaccompanied children. Now it's their parents, their older siblings, caregivers. It seems like an acknowledgment that there is a much larger population of people who are vulnerable here than the President had made in the past.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, we've constantly been evaluating the best approach to tackle the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Central America. What's happening there, as I said, is heartbreaking and it's distressing. And that is why the President had heretofore not been satisfied with the steps that we've been taking. That's why we've been able to expand some of these programs. That's why he's proud that the government of Costa Rica has agreed to host processing in their country. And that all furthers the goal of making sure that any resettlement is done in a safe and orderly way.\nQ: And just one more on the First Lady's speech last night. Even though she had a pretty warm reception in the hall, there are some critics who have responded to her comments about slaves having built the White House, saying that it was somehow race-baiting or a divisive thing to say. Does the White House see it that way?\nMR. SCHULTZ: No.\nMargaret.\nQ: John Kerry met with the Russian Foreign Minister today and said he raised the issue of the DNC hacking. If Russia is not a suspect here, why have America's chief diplomat take that message to Russia's chief diplomat?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I believe that if you ask Secretary Kerry, he will tell you that this is -- the issue of cybersecurity is one that he raises all across the globe; that, unfortunately, the intrusion at the DNC is not an incident that's unique. In fact, when you assess the activity in this space, that we see this all too often. And so I'm fairly certain this wasn't the first time Secretary Kerry raised this with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov. I suspect that Foreign Minister Lavrov is one of many foreign leaders that Secretary Kerry has raised this with.\nQ: But he said specifically he raised the DNC hacking. And Lavrov said to the press, at least, he wanted to use four-letter words to respond to it. So, I mean, this was obviously something that has a lot more weight than just a general discussion of cybersecurity.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I won't use any four-letter words here, much to your relief.\nQ: You would definitely get on TV. (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: Look, you'll have to ask Secretary Kerry to the extent to which -- what the details of the conversation that he conducted with the Foreign Minister.\nQ: Did the White House give him a message to deliver to Russia?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't know that to be true. I believe that Secretary Kerry raises this as an issue pretty regularly with his counterparts. Obviously, we have concerns across the board in this space, and the President takes it seriously. And that's why it's one of the chief issues that when we engage our foreign counterparts around the world that we work on -- as you'll recall, when President Xi was here last year, a lot of work went into establishing an agreement with the Chinese. So this isn't something that we take as a one-off engagement. This is something that we take a holistic approach to. And so I believe Secretary Kerry raising it with Foreign Minister Lavrov is consistent with that approach.\nQ: So is it fair to say that the White House is considering this as not a political issue but a national security one?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think we'd wait until the FBI makes any determination before I'm in a position to sort of characterize our response. And as I mentioned to Michelle, I think that motive is likely to be part of the FBI investigation, but I just can't get ahead of that from here.\nQ: Can you confirm that the administration had previously warned the DNC regarding vulnerabilities of their systems?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that to be true. I do know that, as the federal government, we take a lot of responsibility in promoting best practices. There's a term here at the White House that I'm reluctant to use but we call it cyber hygiene -- yes.\nQ: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm not going to get into graphic descriptions. But we want to make sure that everyone across the board, both in the private sector, in the political space, in people's personal computing, that they're using best practices, because we know that there are bad actors out there looking to do harm.\nAnd so I think, unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, we have too much practice responding to these attacks. That's why the President thought it would be important to sort of codify our responses and make sure that we've written a playbook that distills down best practices from our previous responses.\nQ: So at a minimum, the cyber hygiene kind of program, it would be normal for the administration to advise the DNC, weigh in on their security?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think that we're often in touch with agencies and organizations and companies when they have questions about their cybersecurity. I know that that's a program that's housed at the Department of Homeland Security, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were conversations taking place. I know that lots of large companies reach out to the administration when they have questions about possible intrusions or possible questionable activity on their servers or in their systems. So I wouldn't be surprised if those conversations were happening. But I also wouldn't be surprised if those conversations were happening across the board.\nQ: Can you say what level of communication the administration is having at this point with the DNC? Is it purely just at the FBI level? And is the conversation today between Kerry and Lavrov the highest-level conversation so far directly with Russia about it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any additional communications with the Russians to read out at this time. In terms of conversations with the DNC, as I mentioned, the FBI is the principal investigative agency on this, so I assume any communications would be going through those channels. But you might want to check with the DNC if they've heard from other components of the administration.\nQ: If I could just follow up on the Lavrov meeting, just so I can understand the White House kind of rendering of the discussion. It was completely routine and it didn't have anything to do or any connection to the leaked emails that were published by WikiLeaks?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think you should ask Secretary Kerry about what he brought up in that conversation --\nQ: And you're unaware of any message from the White House delivered to Secretary Kerry that he should inquire along these lines?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm not aware of any directive to do that. But obviously Secretary Kerry is our chief diplomat around the world, so you'll have to ask him to what extent he raised this in the meeting.\nQ: The question for the White House is, was there a message from the White House to Kerry. And you're telling us that you don't know that.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, I'm telling you I'm not aware of one.\nMegan.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. I wanted to clarify one of your earlier responses on the cyber framework. You mentioned that it wasn't going to be applied retroactively, but you also mentioned that this DNC investigation is ongoing. So will the DNC investigation go through the cyber framework? Will we see -- isn't this hack being characterized on the zero-to-five scale?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So the answer to that question is good news, because this is a codification of systems and methods that are already in place. So you can be assured that this hack is going through that scheme because this is just based on methods and processes that we've been using for some time.\nQ: So has it been assigned a zero-to-five designation?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We can check on that. I think they will wait to do that until the FBI determines the results of its investigation.\nQ: And then, second, the President's speech and the President's message generally -- the President recently saying the world has never been less violent. And you just mentioned he's going to be trying to counter some of the darkness that we heard in Cleveland. But just this weekend we saw another shooting in Florida, an attack in Afghanistan that left 80 dead, a German suicide bomber. And then, just in the past, I think, 16 hours or something -- as of this morning we had Ned Price sending out three condolence statements after violent attacks in France, Somalia and Japan. So can you address what seems to be a bit of a contradiction in terms of the President's message and what people may be hearing?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think -- and the President did this, if not on Friday, a little bit earlier in remarks -- but I think it's important to disentangle those two things. One, we've got perpetrated terrorist attacks happening on foreign soil, and then you've also got gun violence in the United States of America. So we can sort of take those things in turn.\nThe terrorist attacks happening on foreign soil are horrific and are unfortunate. And that is why the President has taken a leadership role in making sure that he's summoning I think now 67 international partners to build a coalition to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. That effort remains ongoing. It remains robust. And it remains a top goal of this President for the remainder of his term in office.\nIn terms of the violence we've seen in cities, which I think you're also referencing, there is preliminary data so far from 2015 from the FBI that shows an uptick in murders and violent crime compared to last year in some cities, but if you look at overall trends, violent crime right now remains at historic lows. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't be paying attention to this. To the contrary, the President has asked that his Department of Justice -- to play close attention to any increase in violent crimes, even if they're in sporadic communities. But he does believe it's too early to draw any sweeping conclusions.\nThat said, the Department of Justice does take very seriously any increase in violent crime, and it's -- but we also believe -- and I think the President spoke to this -- that it's important to put any sort of single reports in this historic context.\nQ: Will the President touch on ISIS in his speech at the convention?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't have details to read out to you in advance of the speech. I'd just urge you to tune in tomorrow night.\nQ: And what categorizes something for -- or what is the bar for flags to be flown at half-staff? Will any of these recent events or tragedies qualify for that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: That's a good question, and as you know, when the President directs the flags to be flown at half-staff, we issue a proclamation. Those proclamations are released publicly and then the flags come down, and you all usually cover that.\nSo I don't have any proclamations to forecast for you at this time, but if there's any decisions made on those, we'll make sure we get them to you.\nFred, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: The Democratic platform, it calls for getting rid of the -- for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. The President actually -- pressing the ACA, signed an executive order applying the Hyde Amendment to the ACA. Also the President -- Josh, I think a few times, used the Hyde Amendment as one of the reasons that there's no reason to defund Planned Parenthood. Is that something the President supports, the repeal of the Hyde Amendment?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Fred, I don't believe we have changed our position on the Hyde Amendment. But if we do, you'll be the first to know.\nQ: Okay. So you're not necessarily on board on that particular issue --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Like you said, we have a longstanding view on this and I don't have any changes in our position to announce today.\nQ: And another hack that came up in a congressional (inaudible) few weeks ago, the House Science Committee pointed out that the FDIC had been hacked by China, and that they didn't -- the FDIC did not report it, and it looked like there might have been an attempt to avoid some oversight there. Has the administration looked into this? Is this something that there's a lot of concern about as well?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I have not seen that report so I can't comment on it, and I'm not familiar with the particular episode that you're referencing. I can say, in general terms, that we believe transparency is the best policy when it comes to cyber intrusions, so a lot of what we tried to do in today's announcement was to clarify who do you call. And we laid out the right agencies that are in the lead for each of the aspects that come into play when an intrusion takes place like this, but we absolutely believe that public reporting of these incidents is only in the -- only advances the U.S. national security interest.\nQ: And the last question -- with regards to the DNC emails -- and I'll just take a -- sort of a blunt approach on this --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Go ahead.\nQ: Do you think there's reason to believe that Vladimir Putin does want to see Donald Trump elected President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You'll have to ask Moscow. (Laughter.) I'm sure they'll get right back to you. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- said nice things about each other, so I wanted to see if you might have -- want to weigh in.\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's hard to for me to publicly speculate on motives of United States politicians. The last thing I'm going to do is speculate on Vladimir Putin's motivations.\nQ: There is talk that there's a lot of money from Russia and the nation state in Donald Trump's businesses, and that is possibly a motivation. Wouldn't that make him very vulnerable as a presidential nominee, more vulnerable than usual -- to possibly be controlled or blackmailed by a nation state?\nMR. SCHULTZ: That's not going to be an assessment I can offer from here, but you might want to check with the campaigns.\nThank you.\nEND 1:54 P.M.

APP Note: The Annex to this directive can be found by clicking here:  http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118951", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118828", "text": "Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-41\nSubject: United States Cyber Incident Coordination\nThe advent of networked technology has spurred innovation, cultivated knowledge, encouraged free expression, and increased the Nation's economic prosperity. However, the same infrastructure that enables these benefits is vulnerable to malicious activity, malfunction, human error, and acts of nature, placing the Nation and its people at risk. Cyber incidents are a fact of contemporary life, and significant cyber incidents are occurring with increasing frequency, impacting public and private infrastructure located in the United States and abroad.\nUnited States preparedness efforts have positioned the Nation to manage a broad range of threats and hazards effectively. Every day, Federal law enforcement and those agencies responsible for network defense in the United States manage, respond to, and investigate cyber incidents in order to ensure the security of our information and communications infrastructure. The private sector and government agencies have a shared vital interest in protecting the Nation from malicious cyber activity and managing cyber incidents and their consequences. The nature of cyberspace requires individuals, organizations, and the government to all play roles in incident response. Furthermore, effective incident response efforts will help support an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications infrastructure that promotes trade and commerce, strengthens international security, fosters free expression, and reinforces the privacy and security of our citizens.\nWhile the vast majority of cyber incidents can be handled through existing policies, certain cyber incidents that have significant impacts on an entity, our national security, or the broader economy require a unique approach to response efforts. These significant cyber incidents demand unity of effort within the Federal Government and especially close coordination between the public and private sectors.\nI. Scope\nThis Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) sets forth principles governing the Federal Government's response to any cyber incident, whether involving government or private sector entities. For significant cyber incidents, this PPD also establishes lead Federal agencies and an architecture for coordinating the broader Federal Government response. This PPD also requires the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to maintain updated contact information for public use to assist entities affected by cyber incidents in reporting those incidents to the proper authorities.\nII. Definitions\nA. Cyber incident. An event occurring on or conducted through a computer network that actually or imminently jeopardizes the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of computers, information or communications systems or networks, physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by computers or information systems, or information resident thereon. For purposes of this directive, a cyber incident may include a vulnerability in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. B. Significant cyber incident. A cyber incident that is (or group of related cyber incidents that together are) likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.\nIII. Principles Guiding Incident Response\nIn carrying out incident response activities for any cyber incident, the Federal Government will be guided by the following principles:\nA. Shared Responsibility. Individuals, the private sector, and government agencies have a shared vital interest and complementary roles and responsibilities in protecting the Nation from malicious cyber activity and managing cyber incidents and their consequences. B. Risk-Based Response. The Federal Government will determine its response actions and the resources it brings to bear based on an assessment of the risks posed to an entity, our national security, foreign relations, the broader economy, public confidence, civil liberties, or the public health and safety of the American people. C. Respecting affected entities. To the extent permitted under law, Federal Government responders will safeguard details of the incident, as well as privacy and civil liberties, and sensitive private sector information, and generally will defer to affected entities in notifying other affected private sector entities and the public. In the event a significant Federal Government interest is served by issuing a public statement concerning an incident, Federal responders will coordinate their approach with the affected entities to the extent possible. D. Unity of Governmental Effort. Various government entities possess different roles, responsibilities, authorities, and capabilities that can all be brought to bear on cyber incidents. These efforts must be coordinated to achieve optimal results. Whichever Federal agency first becomes aware of a cyber incident will rapidly notify other relevant Federal agencies in order to facilitate a unified Federal response and ensure that the right combination of agencies responds to a particular incident. State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments also have responsibilities, authorities, capabilities, and resources that can be used to respond to a cyber incident; therefore, the Federal Government must be prepared to partner with SLTT governments in its cyber incident response efforts. The transnational nature of the Internet and communications infrastructure requires the United States to coordinate with international partners, as appropriate, in managing cyber incidents. E. Enabling Restoration and Recovery. Federal response activities will be conducted in a manner to facilitate restoration and recovery of an entity that has experienced a cyber incident, balancing investigative and national security requirements, public health and safety, and the need to return to normal operations as quickly as possible.\nIV. Concurrent Lines of Effort\nIn responding to any cyber incident, Federal agencies shall undertake three concurrent lines of effort: threat response; asset response; and intelligence support and related activities. In addition, when a Federal agency is an affected entity, it shall undertake a fourth concurrent line of effort to manage the effects of the cyber incident on its operations, customers, and workforce.\nA. Threat response activities include conducting appropriate law enforcement and national security investigative activity at the affected entity's site; collecting evidence and gathering intelligence; providing attribution; linking related incidents; identifying additional affected entities; identifying threat pursuit and disruption opportunities; developing and executing courses of action to mitigate the immediate threat; and facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with asset response. B. Asset response activities include furnishing technical assistance to affected entities to protect their assets, mitigate vulnerabilities, and reduce impacts of cyber incidents; identifying other entities that may be at risk and assessing their risk to the same or similar vulnerabilities; assessing potential risks to the sector or region, including potential cascading effects, and developing courses of action to mitigate these risks; facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with threat response; and providing guidance on how best to utilize Federal resources and capabilities in a timely, effective manner to speed recovery.\nThreat and asset responders will share some responsibilities and activities, which may include communicating with affected entities to understand the nature of the cyber incident; providing guidance to affected entities on available Federal resources and capabilities; promptly disseminating through appropriate channels intelligence and information learned in the course of the response; and facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with other Federal Government entities.\nC. Intelligence support and related activities facilitate the building of situational threat awareness and sharing of related intelligence; the integrated analysis of threat trends and events; the identification of knowledge gaps; and the ability to degrade or mitigate adversary threat capabilities. D. An affected Federal agency shall engage in a variety of efforts to manage the impact of a cyber incident, which may include maintaining business or operational continuity; addressing adverse financial impacts; protection of privacy; managing liability risks; complying with legal and regulatory requirements (including disclosure and notification); engaging in communications with employees or other affected individuals; and dealing with external affairs (e.g., media and congressional inquiries). The affected Federal agency will have primary responsibility for this line of effort.\nWhen a cyber incident affects a private entity, the Federal Government typically will not play a role in this line of effort, but it will remain cognizant of the affected entity's response activities, consistent with the principles above and in coordination with the affected entity. The relevant sector-specific agency (SSA) will generally coordinate the Federal Government's efforts to understand the potential business or operational impact of a cyber incident on private sector critical infrastructure.\nV. Architecture of Federal Government Response Coordination for Significant Cyber Incidents [Additional details regarding the Federal Government's coordination architecture for significant cyber incidents are contained in an annex to this PPD.]\nIn order to respond effectively to significant cyber incidents, the Federal Government will coordinate its activities in three ways:\nA. National Policy Coordination [This sub-section supersedes NSPD-54/HSPD-23, paragraph 13, concerning the National Cyber Response Coordination Group.]The Cyber Response Group (CRG), in support of the National Security Council (NSC) Deputies and Principals Committees, and accountable through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (APHSCT) to the NSC chaired by the President, shall coordinate the development and implementation of United States Government policy and strategy with respect to significant cyber incidents affecting the United States or its interests abroad. B. National Operational Coordination 1. Agency Enhanced Coordination Procedures. Each Federal agency that regularly participates in the CRG, including SSAs, shall establish and follow enhanced coordination procedures as defined in the annex to this PPD in situations in which the demands of responding to a significant cyber incident exceed its standing capacity. 2. Cyber Unified Coordination Group. A Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG) shall serve as the primary method for coordinating between and among Federal agencies in response to a significant cyber incident as well as for integrating private sector partners into incident response efforts, as appropriate. A Cyber UCG shall be formed at the direction of the NSC Principals Committee, Deputies Committee, or the CRG, or when two or more Federal agencies that generally participate in the CRG, including relevant SSAs, request its formation. A Cyber UCG shall also be formed when a significant cyber incident affects critical infrastructure owners and operators identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security as owning or operating critical infrastructure for which a cyber incident could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security. A Cyber UCG will normally consist of Federal lead agencies for threat response, asset response, and intelligence support, but will also include SSAs, if a cyber incident affects or is likely to affect sectors they represent. In addition, as required by the scope, nature, and facts of a particular significant cyber incident, a Cyber UCG may include participation from other Federal agencies, SLTT governments, nongovernmental organizations, international counterparts, or the private sector. Following the formation of a Cyber UCG, Federal agencies responding to the incident shall assign appropriate senior executives, staff, and resources to execute the agency's responsibilities as part of a Cyber UCG. The Cyber UCG is intended to result in unity of effort and not to alter agency authorities or leadership, oversight, or command responsibilities. Unless mutually agreed upon between agency heads or their designees, and consistent with applicable legal authorities such as the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.S.C. 1535), Federal departments and agencies will maintain operational control over their respective agency assets. 3. Federal lead agencies. In order to ensure that the Cyber UCG achieves maximum effectiveness in coordinating responses to significant cyber incidents, the following agencies shall serve as Federal lead agencies for the specified line of effort: a. In view of the fact that significant cyber incidents will often involve at least the possibility of a nation-state actor or have some other national security nexus, the Department of Justice, acting through the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, shall be the Federal lead agency for threat response activities. b. The Department of Homeland Security, acting through the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, shall be the Federal lead agency for asset response activities. c. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, shall be the Federal lead agency for intelligence support and related activities. Drawing upon the resources and capabilities across the Federal Government, the Federal lead agencies are responsible for: a. Coordinating any multi-agency threat or asset response activities to provide unity of effort, to include coordinating with any agency providing support to the incident, to include SSAs in recognition of their unique expertise; b. Ensuring that their respective lines of effort are coordinated with other Cyber UCG participants and affected entities, as appropriate; c. Identifying and recommending to the CRG, if elevation is required, any additional Federal Government resources or actions necessary to appropriately respond to and recover from the incident; and d. Coordinating with affected entities on various aspects of threat, asset, and affected entity response activities through a Cyber UCG, as appropriate. C. Field-Level Coordination Field-level representatives of the Federal asset or threat response lead agencies shall ensure that they effectively coordinate their activities within their respective lines of effort with each other and the affected entity. Such representatives may be co-located with the affected entity.\nVI. Unified Public Communications\nThe Departments of Homeland Security and Justice shall maintain and update as necessary a fact sheet outlining how private individuals and organizations can contact relevant Federal agencies about a cyber incident.\nVII. Relationship to Existing Policy\nNothing in this directive alters, supersedes, or limits the authorities of Federal agencies to carry out their functions and duties consistent with applicable legal authorities and other Presidential guidance and directives. This directive generally relies on and furthers the implementation of existing policies and explains how United States cyber incident response structures interact with those existing policies. In particular, this policy complements and builds upon PPD-8 on National Preparedness of March 30, 2011. By integrating cyber and traditional preparedness efforts, the Nation will be ready to manage incidents that include both cyber and physical effects.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-07-26", "title": "Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination"}

The Federal Communications Commission shall be invited to participate should the Chair assess that its inclusion is warranted by the circumstances and to the extent the Commission determines such participation is consistent with its statutory authority and legal obligations.\nThe CRG shall:\ni. Coordinate the development and implementation of the Federal Government's policies, strategies, and procedures for responding to significant cyber incidents; ii. Receive regular updates from the Federal cybersecurity centers and agencies on significant cyber incidents and measures being taken to resolve or respond to those incidents; iii. Resolve issues elevated to it by subordinate bodies as may be established, such as a Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG); iv. Collaborate with the Counterterrorism Security Group and Domestic Resilience Group when a cross-disciplinary response to a significant cyber incident is required; v. Identify and consider options for responding to significant cyber incidents, and make recommendations to the Deputies Committee, where higher-level guidance is required, in accordance with PPD-1 on Organization of the National Security Council System of February 13, 2009, or any successor; and vi. Consider the policy implications for public messaging in response to significant cyber incidents, and coordinate a communications strategy, as necessary, regarding a significant cyber incident.\nB. National Operational Coordination\nTo promote unity of effort in response to a significant cyber incident, a Cyber UCG shall:\ni. Coordinate the cyber incident response in a manner consistent with the principles described in section III of this directive; ii. Ensure all appropriate Federal agencies, including sector-specific agencies (SSAs), are incorporated into the incident response; iii. Coordinate the development and execution of response and recovery tasks, priorities, and planning efforts, including international and cross-sector outreach, necessary to respond appropriately to the incident and to speed recovery; iv. Facilitate the rapid and appropriate sharing of information and intelligence among Cyber UCG participants on the incident response and recovery activities; v. Coordinate consistent, accurate, and appropriate communications regarding the incident to affected parties and stakeholders, including the public as appropriate; and vi. For incidents that include cyber and physical effects, form a combined UCG with the lead Federal agency or with any UCG established to manage the physical effects of the incident under the National Response Framework developed pursuant to PPD-8 on National Preparedness.\nSSAs shall be members of the UCG for significant cyber incidents that affect or are likely to affect their respective sectors. As set forth in Presidential Policy Directive 21, the SSAs for critical infrastructure sectors are as follows: DHS (Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Emergency Services, Government Facilities, Information Technology, Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste, and Transportation Systems); DOD (Defense Industrial Base); Department of Energy (Energy); Department of the Treasury (Financial Services); Department of Agriculture (Food and Agriculture); Department of Health and Human Services (Healthcare and Public Health, and Food and Agriculture); General Services Administration (Government Facilities); Department of Transportation (Transportation Systems); and the Environmental Protection Agency (Water and Wastewater Systems).\nA Cyber UCG shall operate in a manner that is consistent with the need to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, operations, and investigations, the privacy of individuals, and sensitive private sector information.\nA Cyber UCG shall dissolve when enhanced coordination procedures for threat and asset response are no longer required or the authorities, capabilities, or resources of more than one Federal agency are no longer required to manage the remaining facets of the Federal response to an incident.\nIII. Federal Government Response to Incidents Affecting Federal Networks Nothing in this directive alters an agency's obligations to comply with the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) or Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines related to responding to an \"incident,\" \"breach,\" or \"major incident\" as defined in that statute and OMB guidance. Federal agencies shall follow OMB guidance to determine whether an incident is considered a \"major incident\" pursuant to FISMA. If the cyber incident meets the threshold for a \"major incident,\" it is also a \"significant cyber incident\" for purposes of this directive and shall be managed in accordance with this directive.\nA. Civilian Federal Networks\nThe Director of OMB oversees Federal agency information security policies and practices. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Director of OMB, administers the implementation of Federal agency information security policies and practices and operates the Federal information security incident center. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops standards and guidelines for Federal information systems that are mandatory for Federal agencies to implement.\nFederal agencies shall respond to significant cyber incidents in accordance with this directive and applicable policies and procedures, including the reporting of incidents to DHS as required by the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team Federal incident notification guidelines.\nWhere the effects of a significant cyber incident are limited to the operational activities of an individual Federal agency, that affected agency shall maintain primary authority over the affected assets and be responsible for managing the restoration services and related networks, systems, and applications and making the decision to restart an affected system. DHS and other Federal agencies shall provide support as appropriate.\nWhere a significant cyber incident has an impact on multiple Federal agencies or on the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of services to the public, the decision to restart an affected system rests with the owning Federal agency, but OMB and the Federal lead agencies for threat and asset response shall provide a consolidated, timely written recommendation, with appropriate caveats and conditions, to help inform that owning agency's decision.\nB. DOD Information Network\nThe Secretary of Defense shall be responsible for managing the threat and asset response to cyber incidents affecting the Department of Defense Information Network, including restoration activities, with support from other Federal agencies as appropriate.\nC. Intelligence Community Networks\nThe Director of National Intelligence shall be responsible for managing the threat and asset response for the integrated defense of the Intelligence Community (IC) information environment through the Intelligence Community Security Coordination Center, in conjunction with IC mission partners and with support from other Federal agencies, as appropriate.\nIV. Implementation and Assessment\nFederal agencies shall take the following actions to implement this directive:\nA. Charter Within 90 days of the date of this directive, the National Security Council (NSC) staff shall update the CRG charter to account for and support the policy set forth herein, which shall be submitted to the President through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\nB. Enhanced Coordination Procedures\nEach Federal agency that regularly participates in the CRG, including SSAs, shall ensure that it has the standing capacity to execute its role in cyber incident response. To prepare for situations in which the demands of a significant cyber incident exceed its standing capacity, each such agency shall, within 90 days of the date of this directive, establish enhanced coordination procedures that, when activated, bring dedicated leadership, supporting personnel, facilities (physical and communications), and internal processes enabling it to manage a significant cyber incident under demands that would exceed its capacity to coordinate under normal operating conditions.\nWithin 90 days of the date of this directive, the SSAs shall develop or update sector-specific procedures, as needed and in consultation with the sector(s), for enhanced coordination to support response to a significant cyber incident, consistent with this directive.\nEnhanced coordination procedures shall identify the appropriate pathways for communicating with other Federal agencies during a significant cyber incident, including the relevant agency points-of-contact, and for notifying the CRG that enhanced coordination procedures were activated or initiated; highlight internal communications and decisionmaking processes that are consistent with effective incident coordination; and outline processes for maintaining these procedures.\nIn addition, each Federal agency's enhanced coordination procedures shall identify the agency's processes and existing capabilities to coordinate cyber incident response activities in a manner consistent with this directive. The procedures shall identify a trained senior executive to oversee that agency's participation in a Cyber UCG. SSAs shall have a trained senior executive for each of the sectors for which it is the designated SSA under Presidential Policy Directive 21.\nWithin 120 days of the date of this directive, the SSAs shall coordinate with critical infrastructure owners and operators to synchronize sector-specific planning consistent with this directive.\nC. Training\nWithin 150 days of the date of this directive, the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall make necessary updates to its existing Unified Coordination training to incorporate the tenets of this directive.\nWithin 150 days of the date of this directive, Federal agencies shall update cyber incident coordination training to incorporate the tenets of this directive.\nFederal agencies shall identify and maintain a cadre of personnel qualified and trained in the National Incident Management System and Unified Coordination to manage and respond to a significant cyber incident. These personnel will provide necessary expertise to support tasking and decisionmaking by a Cyber UCG.\nD. Exercises\nWithin 180 days of the date of this directive, Federal agencies shall incorporate the tenets of this policy in cyber incident response exercises. This will include exercises conducted as part of the National Exercise Program. Exercises shall be conducted at a frequency necessary to ensure Federal agencies are prepared to execute the plans and procedures called for under this directive. When appropriate, exercises shall consider the effectiveness of the end-to-end information sharing process.\nE. Cyber UCG Post-Incident Review\nUpon dissolution of each Cyber UCG, the Chair of the CRG shall direct a review of a Cyber UCG's response to a significant cyber incident at issue and the preparation of a report based on that review to be provided to the CRG within 30 days. Federal agencies shall modify any plans or procedures for which they are responsible under this directive as appropriate or necessary in light of that report.\nF. National Cyber Incident Response Plan\nWithin 180 days of the date of this directive, DHS and DOJ, in coordination with the SSAs, shall submit a concept of operations for the Cyber UCG to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and the Director of OMB, that is consistent with the principles, policies, and coordination architecture set forth in this directive. This concept of operations shall further develop how the Cyber UCG and field elements of the Federal coordination architecture will work in practice for significant cyber incidents, including mechanisms for coordinating with Federal agencies managing the physical effects of an incident that has both cyber and physical elements and for integration of private sector entities in response activities when appropriate. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, as appropriate, incorporate or reference this concept of operations in the Cyber Incident Annex required by section 205 of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.\nWithin 180 days of the date of this directive, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the SSAs, shall submit a national cyber incident response plan to address cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and the Director of OMB, that is consistent with the principles, policies, and coordination architecture set forth in this directive. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that the plan satisfies section 7 of the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014. This plan shall be developed in consultation with SLTT governments, sector coordinating councils, information sharing and analysis organizations, owners and operators of critical infrastructure, and other appropriate entities and individuals. The plan shall take into account how these stakeholders will coordinate with Federal agencies to mitigate, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure.", "timestamp": "2016-07-26", "title": "Annex to the Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination"}

So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference. And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why. And I'll tell you why. Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess.\nYou look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned. You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police. They mention everybody but our police. They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw.\nSo you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun. 235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton. You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on.\nHer great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it. Bernie Sanders never had a chance.\nAnd total disloyalty, it's like you're fired, get out, fast. The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation, both very serious. What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible.\nIf I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race.\nWith her, everything's just fine. So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences. And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad.\nWhen they talk about change, I noticed they have change. She's been there for 30 years. Thirty years. There's no change. It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama. In my opinion, worse.\nShe lied about TPP. She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States.\nAnd I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated. And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements. First time, yesterday. Well, because of me.\nShe also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation. And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate.\nSo all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it. And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it.\nThey will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't. They will vote it in—just mark my words, hopefully we don't have to worry about it—but she will vote.\nShe'll change a comma, she'll change a paragraph of the 6,000 page document that nobody's even read on our side. Just so you understand, the other countries know every word, every paragraph, every sentence, every single comma and period.\nWe don't even read it, our country. Because we're led by stupid people. so she saw me talking about TPP, she realized that she couldn't defend it, her special interests are pushing her hard because she's bought and sold by the special interests.\nThey're pushing her very hard and so she said she's against it. The day she gets in—which hopefully will never happen—she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP. And that will be another disaster for job in our country, OK?\nSo why don't we start off any questions? Yes, sir?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia. In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook. I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking.\nBy the way, they hacked—they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.\nBut I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked. Now, first of all was what was said on those that's so bad but he said I watched it. I think he was live. But he said we think it was Russia that hacked.\nAnd then he said—and this is in person sitting and watching television as I've been doing—and then he said could be Trump, yeah, yeah. Trump, Trump, oh yeah, Trump. He reminded me of John Lovitz for \"Saturday Night Live\" in the liar where he'd go yes, yes, I went to Harvard, Harvard, yes, yes. This is the guy, you have to see it. Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes. So it is so farfetched. It's so ridiculous. Honestly I wish I had that power. I'd love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country.\nAnd that's why—if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total—assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard. Yes, Jon?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.\nYou saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country. We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands. You see what happened to the French priest. A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man. France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.\nAnd by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years. She's been doing this for 30 years. What she's going to go all of sudden things are going to change? She's bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists. Yes, Tom?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. None, none.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under—I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I don't know, I don't know. It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK. Far, far great than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.\nAnd as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence. Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It was about the things that were said in those e-mails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people—what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it. She knew everything.\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton. Couldn't breathe. And you saw that. It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails. It was a rigged race. It was totally rigged. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy. He wants to go home and go to sleep. But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night. Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night. I didn't even hear about it. Nobody showed it. I didn't see it on television. You people don't talk about it.\nThe Republican Convention was incredible. I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades. Like, some people are saying nine points. In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, \"Los Angeles Times\", Trump 47, Clinton 40. And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton.\nQuestion. [inaudible] Putin say stay out? Why not say that?\nDonald Trump. Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia—which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is—but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this—Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...\nQuestion. [inaudible] this audience and make our campaign—what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country [inaudible]?\nOK. Sure. Two big questions. The minimum wage has to go up. People are—at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states—federal—I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage—but it has to go up.\nNow, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today. He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—he was on television—he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East. Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that. That was not Donald Trump. I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it. And he said it with such surety—Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—I never said I wanted to carpet bomb. That was Ted Cruz. You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that, I think. Go ahead.\nSo I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to—literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day—great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That's what he does. I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest.\nAnd I said, how's it going? He said, unbelievable. Oh good, that's good news. The country's doing well. No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable. The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything—it's the eighth wonder of the world. And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. But he said it's unbelievable. That's what's happened to our country. Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing.\nQuestion. [inaudible] special extreme vetting?\nDonald Trump. Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories. And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting. And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway. Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions. And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening.\nYou look at Orlando, how bad was that? And that was horrible. That was going after the gay community it looks like. We can't let this happen. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let people come in.\nNow Hillary Clinton likes to up it. Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. What?\nI mean Virginia. The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase. And he's not very popular. So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day. And I thought he'd be popular. He's not popular because he asked for tax increases. Big tax increases in Virginia. Big. And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure.\nBut what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants. And it's unacceptable. OK. Yes? [inaudible]\nQuestion. Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges...\nDonald Trump. I saw that.\nQuestion. Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case.\nDonald Trump. Right.\nQuestion. Your reaction [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers, I do. I think she ought to prosecute herself OK? That's my reaction. I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it. And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts.\nAnd I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal. I give a lot of respect, a lot of credit that they stuck it out. And you had victory after victory after victory. And she had no chance, don't forget she prosecuted the best case, what she thought was her best cases first. She should prosecute herself. She should be held accountable.\nQuestion. [inaudible] to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case. Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre.\nDonald Trump. Well, that was a bad case to prove it. That was a bad case. I mean if you're going to do that, it's OK because you have to, you know, there are times when police officers behave very badly. But you have to get the right time. This was not one of those times. And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did. Yes ma'am?\nQuestion. So as you've gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him...\nDonald Trump. Yeah.\nQuestion. And [inaudible]...\nDonald Trump. I have a great relationship with Governor Pence. We spent the last three days together. He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press. The press was saying, and it was interesting, I spoke to him at 11:05, him and his wife, and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if I'd be lucky enough for him to accept. And he accepted. And that was it. For me that was it.\nBut right around that time you had the attack in Nice. And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day. And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack, a horrible attack, horrible. In France. And I delayed the news conference and everyone said, oh he's having second thoughts. I never had a second thought in my life. It was such a lie. I mean so many lies in the press. But it was such a lie. And he has been so great. Honestly he's been even better than I thought OK? Better.\nQuestion. Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?\nDonald Trump. I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.\nNATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.\nGo ahead.\nQuestion. What would you renegotiate: the enhanced interrogation aspect of it? The...\nDonald Trump. I would—Katy, I would renegotiate so much of everything. I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing with everybody, Katy. I'm going to renegotiate our military deals where we're protecting countries and they're not living up to the bargain. They're not living up to the bargain. And everyone agrees with me, except for the media.\nAnd the media never says that. I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now. A couple of months ago, front page, Wall Street Journal, \"We are going to cover terror,\" they announced somebody.\nI think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And—and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying.\nQuestion. On the Geneva Convention [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Yes?\nQuestion. Do you think that they should allow for that, given the [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation, yes.\nAnd by the way, it works.\nQuestion. [inaudible] will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to...\nDonald Trump. I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it.\nThey just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay.\nExcuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do—we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay.\nNo, no—yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay.\nYou know, somebody said, \"but we have treaties.\" I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yes?\nQuestion. [inaudible] how are you planning to [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. We're going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks. I'm going to be doing a big thing on that.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Well, I've been doing very well with the Hispanic community. I mean, really well. I mean, the—the poll numbers are going up very high. I think we had one recently 35 or 36. But I'm going to have a whole—we're going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks.\nSo, and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it, so L.A. Times, 47-40; CNN, way up. They're all way up. Biggest—they say the biggest bounce in memory. Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say, \"Well, Trump didn't get much of a bounce.\" So, you know, I have to at least say.\nJeremy, go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible] do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton?\nDonald Trump. I don't think he respects Clinton. I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton. I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.\nRight now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. OK? He mentioned the \"N\" word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the \"N\" word. You know what the \"N\" word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked.\nHe has a total lack of respect for President Obama. Number one, he doesn't like him. And number two, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me.\nYes? Yes, sir?\nQuestion. [inaudible] relations?\nDonald Trump. Yes, sir.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. But let me finish with Jeremy. Go ahead.\nQuestion. Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer.\nThey're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. No, wait a minute.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. No, I'm not going to be an adversary. No, not at all. I have tenants from China. I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent. I mean, I have great relationships with China. I'm not blaming China for getting away with murder. I'm blaming our leadership is incompetent. We don't know what we're doing.\nI don't blame—I respect China. Hey, if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars—if they can get away with that, my hat's off to them.\nI have no problem with China. I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen. And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama. I think it will get worse.\nIt's going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people, you see that. But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse, than Obama.\nYes?\nQuestion. [off-mike] you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable.\nDonald Trump. That's right.\nQuestion. Working on a plan...\nDonald Trump. That's right, I'm going to be doing something over the next four weeks, very much so.\nQuestion. Are you prepared to give us any sort of...\nDonald Trump. No, I'm prepared to say we're gonna have a great plan. One of the things I think because I've traveled all over the country and I'm going—you know where I'm going, I guess you all know, I don't have to say.\nBut I'm going to Toledo and I'm going to different places today and I've met so many people. This is such a great country, these are such great people. one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard, that go to colleges, good colleges, they're good students, they do a great job.\nNumber one, they get out, they have no jobs. Because our jobs are going to Mexico, they're going to China, they're going to Japan, they're going all over the place. They're not coming here. Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesn't build them here, much.\nAnd the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their—up to their neck. They can't breathe, they're scared, they're so scared they have leveraged their entire life. They have loans.\nAnd I have to tell you, the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it. Because the students get government money, passes through but the number gets higher and higher.\nBecause college costs are out of control, because the colleges say what difference does it make? If you take a look at the salaries being paid, you take a look at what's going on with the colleges.\nBecause all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it. So the colleges are costing so much money. We are going to help the students. Maybe that doesn't fit beautifully within the Republican framework.\nBut I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it. We have to help our students. Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where it's making them sick.\nOur students are under tremendous pressure, we have to help our students. And I'm going to have a plan over the next four weeks.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. [off-mike] talking about possibly...\nDonald Trump. Everything's on the table, you'll see. Everything—it's a very important—it's a very important subject.\nYes, ma'am?\nQuestion. Mr. Trump, [off-mike].\nDonald Trump. I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border, if they don't want people pouring into our country. Likewise, they have confidence with me on ISIS, not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people.\nI think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like there's nothing to it. And then they make their product, they sell it back to the United States, no tax, no nothing, we get nothing except unemployment.\nAnd I think people see that. I can tell you I mean I'm like a pollster myself when I'm in front of these massive audiences, one of the things that gets constantly—you people know because you're there—the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\nBecause Obamacare is a disaster. In Texas, going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase. On November 1st, you're going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases. President Obama is trying to get it moved to December. Because it is election-defying. It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country's history for health care. It's going to be announced on November 1st.\nI just asked the press, don't let him do that. Obamacare is a disaster, people are dying with it. It's a disaster and everybody knows and it's going to fold, anyway.\nIn '17 unfortunately—if I'm president—I mean I've got to take over this mess. It's going to fold, anyway. But repeal and replace Obamacare, people like it.\nThey like the fact that I'm going to protect the Second Amendment, they like the fact that I'm going to rebuild our military which is very depleted. Those are the things that are resonating.\nAnd they don't feel Hillary Clinton can do it.\nJohn, go ahead, John.\nQuestion. [off-mike] Russia has no business in you—that you don't have any...\nDonald Trump. No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.\nAnd even—for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida.\nPalm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff—I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Of course not. I own the Trump organization. Zero, zero. Go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I am.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I did.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I did. Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States. But she would be so wrong. And even women say that. Women don't like her. She would be so wrong. Look, Hillary Clinton is a disaster. She's been a disaster. And even the story told by her husband last night, he left out the most interesting chapter. I won't get into that.\nThe chapter that I really waited for, because it was pretty boring, the chapter that I waited for, I never heard. And he left it out. Look, Hillary Clinton's a disaster. I'd love to see a woman become president and it'll happen, absolutely. But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton. Yes ma'am?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes, I do.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful, they have to be very, very well trained. I speak about it all the time, in fact I mentioned the most recent death, excuse me, I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota. I speak about it all the time. It's a real problem because if the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks. It's a real problem.\nYou don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it's on television night after night after night. The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time. Yes, ma'am, go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is.\nI heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States. Yes, ma'am.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Well, and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people, they've got something bad going on up there. That's something really bad going on. And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism, a term that our president refuses to use, I can't he's still not using it. He's still not using it. And she doesn't want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it. She said she will use it but so far she didn't.\nShe'll probably use it tonight. Like the American flags, as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage, it was a disgrace. You had a room with a massive stage without flags. I think this—I think that the people in the community know what's going on. Whether it's in a mosque or whether it's in the community and they have to report these people. When you look at San Bernardino, people knew—many people knew what was going on. They had bombs lying all over the floor. They had bombs on the floor. I mean, this isn't—you walk into somebody's house, there are bombs lying on the floor—I think there's a problem there. You got to report it.\nAnd by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, OK? David Hinckley was just released—John Hinckley—I think that John Hinckley—excuse me, John Hinckley, should not have been freed. I just heard about it.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government—Russia, China, anybody—to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody's in this country...\nDonald Trump. That's up to the President. Let the President talk to them. Look, here's the problem. Here's the problem, Katy. Katy, here's the problem, very simple. He has no respect...\nQuestion. [inaudible] 30,000 e-mails...\nDonald Trump. Well, they probably have them. I'd like to have them released.\nQuestion. Does that not give you pause?\nDonald Trump. No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well—hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton—here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 e- mails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. A question about Mike Pence, because \"The New York Times\" reported that [inaudible] conversation with John Kasich's campaign, [inaudible] says, you can be the most powerful [inaudible]...\nDonald Trump. That's the most ridiculous conversation. He never had the—Don Jr. told me—let me just tell you. Let me save you a lot of boredom.\nQuestion. [inaudible] Mike Pence's role as vice president if you are elected?\nDonald Trump. Mike Pence will play a big role, but I just want to tell you about John Kasich. I never spoke to him about being vice president. We don't have good chemistry together. I have never spoken to him about being vice president. I would never pick him to be vice president. There was never a conversation, and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky. He never spoke—Don Jr. would never—and that was so long ago, I didn't even know I was going to get the nomination at that point. Just so you understand, I would not have picked John Kasich, wouldn't be the right guy. I mean, for that to have gotten out, that was so ridiculous. And then, I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy. So what's left for the president? I think you know me better than that. That was put out by him. He's a nice man, John Kasich, he's fine. He's fine. I would never have chosen him.\nNow, I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people. There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president, but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job.\nLet me just explain—I never asked John Kasich to be vice president, nor would I. And by the way, I'm leading in Ohio by three points.\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. It probably has. It probably has. Our government is so weak on this stuff. It probably has. Possible. I mean, I have a lot of checks and balance. I have a good system, I guess. I'm not an e- mail person, myself. I don't believe in it, because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an e-mail, I mean, if I send one, I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in e-mail. A lot of people have taught me that, including Hillary. But honestly, it could be, maybe it's hacked. Who knows?\nQuestion. [inaudible] broken the rules in traditional American politics many times. [inaudible] while the other person...\nDonald Trump. Yes, but my message wasn't dark. My message was optimistic, because we're going to fix the problems. Go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. OK.\nQuestion. You've broken that tradition, you've run a very aggressive campaign this week. What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet...\nDonald Trump. No basis. No basis.\nLook, John, I didn't have to do this. When I did this, believe me—you see this incredible resort. It's one of the great in the world. When I did this, I could be here enjoying myself. I don't have to be with you guys. I didn't need this. I have places that are the best in the world, OK. I could be doing other things. I'm doing this because we're going to make America great again. I'm doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal, which was incompetent—when I looked at what's going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China, what's happening with China. And with all of this, with ISIS, with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets. We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards.\nWhen I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it. You know this country's been great to me. I'm giving back. That's all.\nNow as far as running a campaign, I guess it's probably not typical. But they said that against, you know when I ran there was 17 people, a total of 17. Governors, Senators, Ben Carson who's a fantastic guy, capable people. Wait a minute. Everybody said, oh he can never win because look what he's doing. He's giving a talk to 5,000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybody's house and having dinner.\nAnd then I won New Hampshire. And then I won you know 38 or 39 states. And won by the way, not by a little bit. Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party. So just...\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. OK but John but the point is this, so it's a different kind of a campaign. But it's what I think is good. I think it's good. I think it's working here too.\nQuestion. But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what we've seen in previous campaigns. And I'm wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances, with campaign appearances while they were [inaudible]...\nDonald Trump. Well, when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy, which was on television this morning, or carpet bomb. He used the term carpet bomb. When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb, I never said that. That was Ted Cruz that said that OK? That was Ted Cruz, wasn't me.\nWhen Sanders, and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade. But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage, lower, it's a lie. So I have a choice. All my people say don't respond to it, it doesn't matter. I say to me it does matter. It matters.\nWhen people tell lies, politicians who tell lies very well, that's what they do, that's why they're politicians. But when politicians tell lies, and I'm lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone. In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that. Or I can say that I didn't say that, Bernie Sanders. And you guys know that I didn't. In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.\nSo it's nice to be able to, President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago, Donald Trump will never be president. Today on \"The Today Show\" he said, this is democracy. A little bit different. Little bit different. [laughter]\nDavid, go ahead Dave.\nQuestion. Last night at the Democratic Convention [inaudible] women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage. Can you clarify your position on those?\nDonald Trump. You'll have to see it in the polls David. You know what my positions are. You'll have to see it at the polls.\nQuestion. I don't know what...\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yeah go ahead.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. David my positions are down. You ask the question every single time. I give you an answer. My positions are down. Take a look. Go ahead.\nQuestion. Didn't you hold a Miss Universe Pageant—?\nDonald Trump. Yes I did.\nQuestion. Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations...\nDonald Trump. We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted...\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.\nFrankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yes ma'am go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible] President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency. Last night he said that anything is possible.\nDonald Trump. He did say that.\nQuestion. What is your reaction to that?\nDonald Trump. Well, I just said sort of said that. He just said that. He said it this morning, anything's possible. I think I'm going to win. I think people are sick and tired of incompetence. They're sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes. Whether it's taxes, whether it's debt, whether it's any one of 15 different things. And that's why. I mean I think I'll win the election. I think you'll see that in the polls.\nAll right a few more questions. Go ahead John.\nQuestion. Back in December...\nDonald Trump. I hope your arm's OK.\nQuestion. It's all right. Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership. Now that you are the Republican nominee, it is a tradition once you secure the Party's nomination, to do a trip...\nDonald Trump. Well, it's a tradition but I don't do things that are traditional. But I have great support from Israel. I will back Israel 100 percent. I would like to go there. But I have great relationships as you know, to the people in Israel.\nAnd by the way, Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking that's ever happened to Israel. He has been a disaster for Israel.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. I don't know. I don't know. I haven't set my schedule yet. It could happen.\nQuestion. [inaudible] you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. No, I think we—it's possible we have. But I'm not—I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us—tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.\nI'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well.\nYes, ma'am, in the back?\nQuestion. Mr. Trump, [inaudible]\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. No, no. Excuse me. In the back?\nQuestion. I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize [inaudible] Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.\nGo ahead.\nQuestion. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] questions. First, a quick one on the minimum wage. You said we need to raise it to $10. [inaudible] be clear here. Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?\nDonald Trump. Federal.\nQuestion. OK. Second question about [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Right.\nQuestion. You said [inaudible]. Would religion be a part of the [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. I'm not making it a part. But at some point, maybe people will change their minds, but as of right now, I'm not making it a part.\nOK.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yes, ma'am? Go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. Who said that?\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. Who?\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history. His views of the world, as he says, don't jive. And the world is a mess. You look at what's happening with the migration, with Syria, with Libya, with Iraq, with everything he's touched. He has been a disaster as a president. He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country. It is a mess.\nAnd I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse.\nGo ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible] polls you [inaudible]. You just said [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Oh, [inaudible] just said that? Many polls show that you are winning? I can't believe it. Are you Katy Turek of NBC? It's a disguise.\nGo ahead.\n[laughter]\nQuestion. Many polls show you [inaudible]. He said he feels that you are [inaudible] not prepared to be president. Can you [inaudible] lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis? How does your [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. OK. Well, [inaudible].\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. [inaudible] about what's going on [inaudible] and domestic affairs.\nDonald Trump. Sure. Well, you've been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times. I've turned out to be right. I turned out to be right on NATO. After I said that on NATO, NATO changed their whole program because of me.\nExcuse me, Katy, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she's going to start renegotiating trade deals. She never said that in her life. She said it yesterday only because of me. I'm the one that's prepared. President Obama when he became president, he didn't know anything. This guy didn't know a thing. And honestly, today he knows less. Today, he knows less.\nHe's done a terrible job. I think I'm very prepared.\nNow, with that being said, I've been a businessman all my life, but I've been watching it. I've been seeing it. I've been feeling. And as you know, I've been very much involved in politics from the other side. I understand politics or I guess I wouldn't be here. I mean, I beat a lot of very talented people.\nQuestion. [inaudible] advisers, though?\nDonald Trump. I do. I have great foreign advisers. And you have a list. And I gave you a list. And the other day, as an example, General Quinn and General Flynn, and we have so many—we have so many. As an example, I had a meeting three or four days ago, and I'm going to do a report on it, with seven or eight very, very talented advisers.\nNow, with all of that being said, a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names. Look at the mess they've gotten us into. They said, \"Have you spoken to so and so?\" Well, I said, but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago, which I was not in favor of. \"Have you spoken to this one or that one?\" I said, they were all—look at the job they've done.\nSo a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television, I don't think are good. Because look at the end result. The end result is our country is a mess. The Middle East has never been worse. Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents, with an \"S,\" gone to the beach and relaxed, we'd be in better shape than we are right now.\nAll right, Tom. A couple more. Go ahead, Tom.\nQuestion. [inaudible] security briefings. You're about to get one.\nDonald Trump. Yeah.\nQuestion. Do you expect your opinion on [inaudible] or your opinion on [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Well, we'll have to see. I mean, that's my opinion. That's my opinion. We'll have to see. I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she's been probably hacked, when so much of her information, the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent. It was negligent.\nNow why are they giving her briefings, why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings? Because it's going to get revealed. I mean her number one person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and a pervert. And I'm not saying that, I mean that's recorded history, right?\nI don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning. So I don't think that I know at some point, they're going to be calling, they're going to want to brief me, but I'm not a talker about this stuff.\nI don't think that it's safe to have Hillary Clinton, in light of what just happened, and in light of what we just found out, I don't think it's safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. No. He's not going to run for mayor. Oh, Don? He's not going to run for mayor. Don has no attention of running for mayor. But he did a great job the other night with his speech. Because he made a good speech, everyone says he should run for mayor. You know why? Because we have a Democratic mayor who's horrible, he's doing a horrible job, de Blasio. But Don is not going to run for—he has no interest in running for mayor.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Unbelievable what he said. I think it's disgraceful. Hillary Clinton, because of me, said that TPP is not going to happen. But we all know it is going to happen if she won. Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in, she's lying and it will happen. And there is nobody closer, I know this for a fact, there is nobody, including her own husband, closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe, OK? Go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Oh I don't know what he said, Jon, I really—Anthony Weiner's—look, look, look—Anthony Weiner is a proven loser. I mean the poor guy, he's locked up in a room. They lock him up in a room, they don't let him out. I don't know what Anthony—my son doesn't want to run for mayor. He has no intention of running for mayor.\nAnd besides that, as a Republican, you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan, as you know, and in that area. It's almost impossible for a Republican to win. So, and my son likes to win, but my son has no intention of running for mayor so let's just put that to bed. Go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes, in [inaudible] very sad. Not [inaudible].\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes, I'm looking at it. I actually want to find out what causes it. It's a problem in many areas, OK? Yes, go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Well, they shouted—you know what was interesting. Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw, and it was very well received, she was there the day before. And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before, started screaming, \"Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up.\" They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech.\nDonald Trump. And I said, \"Don't do that.\" Now, I didn't do that for any reason. I really—I didn't like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said—they started screaming \"Lock her up! Lock her up.\" I said, \"Don't do that.\" Nobody reported that I said that, because it's dishonest reporting.\nYou do agree I said that, right?\nQuestion. You did say that.\nDonald Trump. OK. Well, why didn't somebody report that?\nQuestion. That's what I want to ask you about, you said you...\nDonald Trump. No, I think it's—I think it's a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.\nOK, one more question, yes—yes, ma'am, go ahead.\nQuestion. Yes, three weeks is a long time to wait for that [inaudible] immigration.\nThis is Doral, it was built by...\nDonald Trump. Well, Doral is great. And Doral—I think I have over 1,000 Hispanics working at Doral, and they're doing a great job.\nYes, ma'am, in the yellow, go ahead. Yellow.\nQuestion. I have another question.\nDonald Trump. Excuse me. Yellow.\nQuestion. Hillary Clinton's running mate...\nDonald Trump. Who?\nQuestion. Hillary Clinton's running mate speaks Spanish. Do you think this [inaudible] an advantage on...\nDonald Trump. No, I don't think it has any impact. He's been very bad—her running mate has been very, very bad on employment. And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia, he has been so bad.\nI figured when she chose him, he was very popular in Virginia. They don't like him. They don't like him. It has been very close races, and his polling is very bad.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I think it's time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference, because it's almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does.\nThank you all very much.\nQuestion. [inaudible] running for the president [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. Might as well tell him to have a good time. He has done one bad job.\nOK, thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-07-27", "title": "News Conference in Doral, Florida"}
{"author": "Tim Kaine", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118048", "text": "Senator Kaine. Thank you everybody. Hello, Philadelphia! [applause] Hello Democratic families.\nI want to start off by thanking my beautiful wife and my three wonderful children, Nat, Woody, and Annella. They are sitting right up there. [applause]\nYou Know my son, Nat, deployed with his Marine battalion just two days ago. [applause]\nHe deployed overseas to protect and defend the very NATO allies that Donald Trump says he now wants to abandon.\nSemper fi, Nat! Semper fi! [applause]\nMy parents and my in-laws are here. Our siblings and their spouses. Our nieces and nephews, and hundreds of friends from Virginia and beyond. [applause]\nI love seeing you front and center. Including my friend of 37 years, senior Senator Mark Warner. My great Governor Terry McAuliffe. [applause]\nAnd my great friend and Congressman Bobby Scott. [applause]\nWe love you all.\nToday, for my wife Anne and every strong woman in this country, for Nat, Woody, and Annella, and every young person starting out in life to make their own dreams real, for every man and woman serving our country in the military at home or abroad, for every working family working hard to get ahead and stay ahead, for my parents and in-laws and every senior citizen who hopes for a dignified retirement with health care and research to end diseases like Alzheimer's. [applause]\nFor every American who wants our country to be a beloved community where people are not demeaned because of who they are but rather respected for their contributions to this nation, and for all of us who know that the brightest future for our country is the one that we build together, and for my friend, Hillary Clinton, I humbly accept my party's nomination to be vice president of the United States. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nCan I be honest with you about something? Can I be honest with you about something? I never expected to be here. But let me tell you how it happened, I was born in Minnesota and grew up in Kansas City. [applause]\nMy folks were not much into politics. My dad ran a union iron- working shop in the stockyards. [applause]\nAnd my mom was his best salesman. My two brothers and I pitched in to work during summers and weekends. And, you know, that is how small family businesses do it.\nMy parents, Al and Kathy, here tonight and going strong, they taught me about hard work and about kindness and most especially, about faith. I went to a Jesuit boys high school, Rockhurst High School. [applause]\nWow, that's a big line for the Jesuits.\nNow we had a motto in my school, \"men for others.\" And it was there that my faith became something vital. My north star for orienting my life. And when I left high school, I knew that I wanted to battle for social justice. [applause]\nLike so many of you. Like so many of you.\nThat is why I took a year off from law school to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. I taught kids how to be welders and carpenters. [speaking in Spanish], faith, family, and work. Faith, family, and work. [speaking in Spanish].\nAnd let me tell you what really struck me there, I got a firsthand look at a different system. A dictatorship. A dictatorship where a few people at the top had all the power and everybody else got left out.\nNow that convinced me that we have got to advance opportunity for everybody, no matter where you come from, how much money you have, what you look like, how you worship or who you love. [applause]\nBack in 1970, in Virginia, a Republican governor named Linwood Holton believed exactly the same thing. He integrated Virginia's public schools so that black and white kids could finally learn together. And then the family enrolled their own kids, including his daughter, Anne, in those integrated inner city schools.\nMany years later Anne went off to college and she brought those lessons from that pivotal time with her. And then one day, in a study group, she met this goofy guy who had been off teaching kids in Honduras.\nWell, Anne and I have now been married almost 32 years and I am the luckiest husband in the world. [applause]\nYou know, let me tell you something, Anne's parents, Lin and Jinks, are here today, 90-plus and going strong. [applause]\nNinety-plus and going strong. Linwood Holton, he is still a Republican but he is voting for an awful lot of Democrats these days. An awful lot of Democrats. [applause]\nAnd here is why, he is voting for Democrats because any party that would nominate Donald Trump for president has moved too far away from his party of Lincoln. [applause]\nAnd I'll tell you, if any of you are looking for that party of Lincoln, we have got a home for you right here in the Democratic Party. [applause]\nLinwood's example helped inspire me as a civil rights lawyer. Over 17 years I took on banks, landlords, real estate firms, local governments, anybody who treated anybody unfairly.\nI had a six-year case against an insurance company that was discriminating against minority neighborhoods all across the United States in issuing homeowner's insurance.\nFolks, Democratic friends, these are the battles that I have fought my entire life. [applause]\nAnd that is the story — and that is the story of how I decided to run for office. My city of Richmond was divided and discouraged in the early 1990s. We had an epidemic of gun violence that was overwhelming our low-income neighborhoods.\nPeople were pointing fingers and casting blame instead of finding answers. And I couldn't stand it. So I ran for city council and I won that first race more than 20 years ago by a landslide margin of 94 votes. [applause]\nAnd I've said ever since, if I'm good at anything in politics, it's because I started at the local level listening to people, learning about their lives, and trying to get results. I see a mayor here who knows what I'm talking about.\nLater I became mayor of Richmond, lieutenant governor, and then the 70th governor of Virginia. [applause]\nNow, I was a hard times governor. I had to steer my state through the deepest recession since the 1930s. But hey, tough times don't last and tough people do. And can I tell you that Virginians are tough people? We are tough people. [applause]\nAnd we are smart, too . We achieved national recognition for our work, best-managed state, best state for business, best state for a child to be raised, low unemployment, high median income.\nWe shed tears along the way. We shed tears especially together in the days after that horrible mass shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people from beautiful 19-year-old students to 70-plus-year- old Romanian-born Holocaust survivors, and we shed tears and held each other up, but afterwards we rolled up our sleeves and we fixed the loophole in the background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer. And we got have to do that in the nation. [applause]\nWe invested in our people expanding pre-K and higher ed., because we all know in this room that education is the key to all we want to be, all we want to be. [applause]\nAnd now I have the honor of representing my commonwealth in the U.S. Senate. I work on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees to keep us safe at home and strong in the world. [applause]\nI work on the Budget Committee with our great Democratic leader of that committee, a spectacular senator who used to be a mayor, Vermont's Bernie Sanders. [applause]\nAudience. Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\nSenator Kaine. And, everybody, we all should feel the Bern and we all should not want to get burned by the other guy. [applause]\nOn that Budget Committee under Bernie's leadership, we fight for investments in education, health care, research, transportation. And I also serve on the Aging Committee to make sure that seniors like my folks have a secure retirement and don't get targeted by rip-off artists who will scam them out of their savings or overcharge them for prescription drugs. [applause]\nCan I tell you a funny thing about the Senate? Can I tell you a funny thing about the Senate? [applause]\nThat sounds like a yes. I spend a lot of time with Republican senators who, once they have made sure that nobody is listening, will tell you how fantastic a senator that Hillary Clinton was. [applause]\nNow, look, this journey that I've told you about has convinced me, has convinced me over and over again that God has created in our country a beautiful and rich tapestry, an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everybody in love and battle back against the forces, the dark forces of division.\nWe are all neighbors. And we must love neighbors as ourselves. [applause]\nNow Hillary Clinton and I are companeros de alma. [applause]\nAnd we share this basic belief, it's simple. Do all the good you can and serve one another. Pretty simple. Pretty simple. [applause]\nThat is what I'm about. That is what you are about. That is what Bernie Sanders is about. That is what Joe and Jill Biden are about. That is what Barack and Michelle Obama are about. And that is what Hillary Clinton is about. [applause]\nAudience. Si se puede!\nSenator Kaine. Si se puede, si se puede, si se puede. [applause]\nAudience. Si se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede!\nSenator Kaine. Yes we can. Yes we can. Yes we can.\nHey, last week, last week in Cleveland we heard a lot about trust. So let's talk about trust. Let's talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. [applause]\nFirst, she's consistent. She has battled to put kids and families first since she was a teenager. In good times and bad. In victory and defeat. In and out of office.\nThrough hell or high water, fighting for underprivileged kids working at the Children's Defense Fund. Fighting to get health insurance for 8 million low-income children when she was first lady. Fighting for the well-being of women and children around the world. Hey, can offer you a little tip? When you want to know something about the character of somebody in public life, look to see if they have a passion that began long before they were in office, and that they have consistently held it throughout their career. [applause]\nDo they have a passion? Did it start before they were in office? Have they held on to it consistently? Folks, Hillary has a passion for kids and families. [applause]\nDonald Trump has a passion too, it's himself. [applause]\nAnd with Hillary, it is not just words, it's accomplishments. She delivers. As senator, after 9/11 I got my New Yorkers right here and my Virginians right here. She battled — she battled congressional Republicans to care for the first responders who went in to the Towers, who went in to the Pentagon and saved the victims of those terrorist attacks.\nAs secretary of state, she implemented tough sanctions against Iran to pave the way for a diplomatic breakthrough to curtail a nuclear weapons program. And she wasn't afraid, she wasn't afraid. She was not afraid to stand up against thugs and dictators, and as a key part of the Obama national security team, they decided to go to the ends of the earth to wipe out Osama bin Laden. [applause]\nHey, do you all remember Carla, the little girl that we heard from on Monday night, who was worried that her parents would be deported? Carla said she trusts Hillary to keep them together. [applause]\nAnd do you remember the Mothers of the Movement last night? [applause]\nThey said they trust Hillary to keep other mothers' sons and daughters safe.\nAnd on a personal level, as he is serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son's life. [applause]\nNow you know who I don't trust? Hmm, I wonder. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Trump is a guy who promises a lot but, you may have noticed, he has got a way of saying the same two words every time he makes his biggest, hugest promises.\n\"Believe me.\" It's going to be great, believe me. We are going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for, believe me. [laughter]\nWe are going to destroy ISIS so fast, believe me. [laughter]\nThere is nothing suspicious and my tax returns, believe me. [laughter] [applause]\nBy the way, does anybody in this massive auditorium believe that Donald Trump has been paying his fair share of taxes?\nAudience. No!\nSenator Kaine. Does anybody here believe that Trump ought to release his tax returns just like every other presidential candidate in modern history? [applause]\nOf course he should. Hey, Donald, what are you hiding? And yet, Donald still says, believe me. Believe me.\nBelieve me? Believe me? I mean, here's the thing, most people when they run for president, they don't just say, believe me, they respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done. [applause]\nI mean, that is what most people who run for president do. In fact, you can go on hillaryclinton.com right now and find out exactly how she will make the biggest investment in new jobs in a generation.\nHow she will defend and build on Wall Street reform. How she will reform our immigration system to create a path to citizenship. How she will make it possible to graduate from college debt-free.\nYou can see how she will protect Roe V. Wade, guarantee equal pay for women, and make paid family leave a reality. [applause]\nAll it takes is one click. All it takes is one click. And we can see how she will do it, how she will pay for it, and how we will benefit by it.\nNot Donald Trump. Not Donald Trump. He never tells you how he is going to do any of the things he says he will do. He just says, believe me. [laughter]\nSo here's the question, here's the question, do you really believe him?\nAudience. No!\nSenator Kaine. I mean, Donald Trump's whole career says you had better not. Small contractors, companies just like my dad's believed him, believed him when he said that he would pay them to build a casino in Atlantic City.\nThey do the work. They hung the drywall. They poured the concrete. But a year after opening, Trump filed for bankruptcy, he walked away with millions, and they got pennies on the dollar.\nSome of them went out of business. All because they believed Donald Trump. [booing]\nRetirees and families in Florida, they believed Donald Trump when he said that he would build up some condos. Thousands of them. They paid their deposits but the condos, they were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away.\nThey lost tens of thousands of dollars all because they believed Donald Trump. Charity after charity believed Donald Trump when he said they would contribute to them. And thousands of Trump University students believed Donald Trump when he said he would help them succeed.\nThey got stiffed. [booing]\nHe says, believe me. Well, his creditors, his contractors, his laid-off employees, and his ripped-off students did just that and they all got hurt.\nFolks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. [applause]\nNot one word. Not one word. Not one word.\nAudience. Not one word! Not one word! Not one word!\nSenator Kaine. And I will tell you, and I will tell you, to me, it just seems like our nation, it is just too great to put in the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting one-man wrecking crew. [applause]\nBut don't take it from me, don't take it from me. Take it from former first lady Barbara Bush. Barbara Bush said she doesn't know how any woman could vote for him after his offensive comments about women. [applause]\nAny woman. Any woman. Or John McCain's chief economic adviser during the '08 race, who estimates that Donald Trump's promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs.\nOr the independent analysts who found that Trump's tax plan given to the wealthy and the biggest corporations would rack up $30 trillion in debt.\nOr how about this? How about this? John Kasich, the Republican governor who had the honor of hosting the Republican Convention in Cleveland, but he wouldn't even attend it because he thinks Donald Trump is such a moral disaster. [applause]\nOr take it from the guy who co-wrote Donald Trump's autobiography, here is what he said about Trump, quote, \"lying is second nature to him.\" So do you believe him?\nAudience. No!\nSenator Kaine. I don't know, how about on this side, do you guys believe him?\nAudience. No!\nSenator Kaine. I mean, do you guys believe him?\nAudience. No!\nSenator Kaine. Is there anyone in this building who believes him?\nAudience. No!\nSenator Kaine. The next president will face many challenges, we had better elect a candidate who has proven she can be trusted with the job. [applause]\nThe candidate who has proven that she is ready for the job. And when I say ready, I use ready for a specific reason. When I lived in Honduras, I learned something. The best compliment that you could pay to somebody was to say that they were listo. Ready. Not inteligente, smart. Not amable, friendly. Not rico, rich. But listo, listo.\nBecause what listo means in Spanish is this, it means prepared, it means battle-tested, it means rock solid, up for anything, never backing down. And, friends, Hillary Clinton, she is listo! [applause]\nHillary Clinton is listo. [applause] She is ready. She is ready, she is ready because of her faith. She is because of her heart. She is ready because of her experience. And she is ready because she knows that in America, we are stronger when we are together. [applause]\nMy fellow Democrats, this week we start the next chapter in our great and proud story. Thomas disclaimed all men were equal and Abigail remembered the women. Woodrow brokered the peace and Eleanor broke down the barriers. Jack told us what to ask and Lyndon answered the call.\nMartin had a dream and Cesar y Dolores said si se puede. And Harvey gave his life. Bill, Bill built a bridge into the 21st Century and Barack gave us hope. And now Hillary is ready! She is ready to fight! She is ready to win! And she is ready to lead!\nGod bless all of you, onto victory. And thank you, Philadelphia!

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you, thank you. You've- – I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, eight years ago, I stood on a stage in Denver. And I accepted your nomination to be Vice President of the United States. And every single day since then is been the honor of our lives for Jill and me. Everyday, we've been grateful to Barack and Michelle for asking them to join us in this, join them in that incredible journey. [applause]\nA journey, a journey that can only happen in America. [applause]\nBut we not only have worked together, as it becomes pretty obvious, we've become friends. We're now family.\nWe're family. Folks, you've all seen over the last eight years, what President Obama means to this country. He's the embodiment – – [applause]\nHe is the embodiment of honor, resolve and character. One of the finest Presidents we have ever had. [applause]\nThat's right. [applause]\nThis is a man of character. [applause]\nAnd he's become a brother to Jill and me. And Michelle, I don't where you are kid, but you're incredible. You are incredible. [applause]\nAnd I was talking to Barack today, it's no longer who's going to give the best speech, we already know who did that. You were incredible Monday night. [applause]\nThe Delaware delegation as they say in Southern Delaware – – [applause]\nBarack and I married way up. Way up. Folks, as I stand here tonight, I see so many friends and colleagues, like my buddy Chris Dodd and the Connecticut delegation. So many people are here. I see the faces of those who have placed their belief in Barack and me. So many faces, but one.\nThis is kind of a bittersweet moment for Jill and me and our family. In 2008, when he was about to deploy to Iraq and again in 2012, our son Beau introduced me to the country and placed my name in nomination.\nYou got a glimpse, I know I sound like a Dad, but you got a glimpse of what an incredibly fine young man Beau was. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nHis wife Hallie, and his two kids are here tonight. [applause]\nBut as Ernest Hemingway once wrote, the world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong at the broken places. I've been made strong at the broken places, by my love Jill, by my heart, my son Hunter and the love of my life, my Ashley.\nAnd by all of you, and I mean this sincerely, those of you that have been through this, you know I mean what I say. By all of you, you're love, your prayers, your support, but you know what, we talk about, we think about the countless thousands of other people, who suffered so much more than we have, with so much less support.\nSo much less reason to go on. But they get up, every morning, everyday. They put one foot in front of the other. They keep going. That's the unbreakable spirit of the people of America. That's who we are. [applause]\nThat's who we are. Don't forget it. Like the people in the neighborhood that Jill and I grew up in. She in Willow Grove and mine down in Wilmington, and Claymont. The kid in Claymont with the most courage — always jumped in when you were double teamed or your back was against the wall, who became a cop, because he always wanted to help people. The middle daughter of three daughters, who always made her mother smile, who was a hero to her sisters. Now a major in the United States Marine Corps because Mr. President, I wanted to serve my country.\nThe teacher, the teachers who Jill knows, and so many of you know, who take money out of their own pockets to buy pencils and notebooks for the students who can't afford them. [applause]\nWhy? Why, because being a teacher is not what they do, it's who they are. [applause] You know what I know, for real. These are the people who are the heart and soul of this country. It's the America that I know. The America that Hillary knows and Tim Kaine knows. You know, I've known Hillary for well over 30 years, before she was First Lady of the United States, when she became First Lady. We served in the United States Senate. And during her years of Secretary of State, once a week we had breakfast in my home, the Vice President's residence.\nEverybody knows, she's smart. Everybody knows, she's tough. But I know what she's passionate about. I know Hillary. [applause]\nHillary understands. Hillary gets it. Hillary understands that college loan is about a lot more than getting a qualified student education. It's about saving the mom and dad from the indignity of having to look at their talented child and say sonny, honey, I'm so sorry. The bank wouldn't lend me the money. I can't help you to get to school. I know that about Hillary.\nHillary understood that for years, millions of people went to bed staring at the ceiling, thinking oh my God what if I get breast cancer, or he has a heart attack. I will lose everything, what will we do then? I know about Hillary Clinton.\nLadies and gentlemen, we all understand what it will mean for our daughters and granddaughters, when Hillary Clinton walks into the Oval Office as President of the United States of America. It will change their lives. [applause]\nMy daughters and granddaughters can do anything, any son or grandson can do. And she will prove it Mr. Mayor. So let me say as clearly I can, as I can, if you live in the neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in. If you worry about your job and getting a decent pay, if you worry about your children's education, if you're taken care of an elderly parent. Then there's only one, only one person in this election who will help you.\nThere's only one person in this race who will be there, who has always been there for you, and that's Hillary Clinton's life story. It's not just who she is, it's her life story. She's always there. She's always been there, and so has Tim Kaine. [applause]\nLadies and gentlemen, to state the obvious and I'm not trying to be a wise guy here. I really mean it. That's not Donald Trump's story. Just listen to me a second without booing or cheering. I mean this sincerely, we should really think about this. His cynicism is unbounded.\nHis lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in a phrase that I suspect he's most proud of having made famous, you're fired. I mean really, I'm not joking. Think about that. Think about that. Think about everything you learned as a child, no matter where you were raised. How can there be pleasure in saying, you're fired? He's trying to tell us, he cares about the middle class, give me a break. That's a bunch of malarkey. [applause]\nI tell you. [applause]\nFolks, whatever, – – [applause]\nWhatever he thinks, whatever he thinks and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I know I'm called middle class Joe and in Washington, that's not meant as a compliment. It means you're not sophisticated. But I know why we're strong. I know why we have held together. I know why, we are united. It's because there's always been a growing middle class. This guy doesn't have a clue about the middle class, not a clue. [applause]\nBecause, folks, when the middle class does well, when the middle class does well, the rich do very well and the poor have hope. They have a way up. He has no clue about what makes America great. Actually he has no clue period. [applause]\nBut folks, let me – – you got it. [applause]\nOK. But folks, let me, let me say, let me say something that has nothing to do with politics. Let me talk about something that I am deadly serious about. This is a complicated and uncertain world we live in. The threats are too great. The times are too uncertain, to elect Donald Trump as President of the United States, now let me finish. No major party, no major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less has been less prepared to deal with our national security. [applause]\nWe cannot elect a man who exploits are fears of ISIS and other terrorists. Who has no plan whatsoever to make us safer. A man who embraces the tactics of our enemies, torture, religious intolerance, you all know. All the Republicans know, that's not who we are. It betrays our values. It alienates those who we need in the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump, with all his rhetoric, would literally make us less safe. We cannot elect a man, who belittles are closest allies, why embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin. No, I mean that. A man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain, and disorder around the world. A man who confuses bluster with strength. We simply cannot let that happen as Americans, period. [applause]\nFolks – – [applause]\nI have, no one every doubts I mean what I say. It's just that sometimes they say all that I mean. But folks, let me tell you what I literally tell every world leader I've met with and I've met them all. It's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America. [applause]\nWe have the finest fighting force in the world. Not only – – [applause]\nNot only, not only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world. We have the most productive workers in the world. And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever, let their country down. Never. [applause]\nNever. Ordinary people like us who do extraordinary things – –\nWe've had candidates before attempted to get elected to appealing to our fears, but they never succeeded, because we do not scare easily.

The 21st century is going to be the American century. [applause]\nBecause we lead by not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. That is the history of the journey of America. And God willing, God willing, Hillary Clinton will write the next chapter in that journey. We are America, second to none. And we own the finish line.

Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody.\nAudience members. Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you back!\nHello, America! Hello, Democrats!\nAudience members. Hello!\nThe President. So 12 years ago tonight, I addressed this convention for the very first time. You met my two little girls, Malia and Sasha, now two amazing young women who just fill me with pride. You fell for my brilliant wife and partner Michelle, who has made me a better father and a better man, who's gone on to inspire our Nation as First Lady, and who somehow hasn't aged a day.\nI know, the same cannot be said for me. [Laughter] My girls remind me all the time: \"Wow, you've changed so much, Daddy.\" [Laughter] And then they try to clean it up: \"Not bad, you're just more mature.\" [Laughter]\nAnd it's true. I was so young that first time in Boston. And look, I'll admit it, maybe I was a little nervous, addressing such a big crowd. But I was filled with faith: faith in America, the generous, big-hearted, hopeful country that made my story—that made all of our stories—possible.\nNow, a lot's happened over the years. And while this Nation has been tested by war and it's been tested by recession and all manner of challenges, I stand before you again tonight, after almost two terms as your President, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before.\nHow could I not be, after all that we've achieved together? After the worst recession in 80 years, we fought our way back. We've seen deficits come down, 401(k)s recover, an auto industry set new records, unemployment reach 8-year lows, and our businesses create 15 million new jobs.\nAfter a century of trying, we declared that health care in America is not a privilege for a few, it is a right for everybody. After decades of talk, we finally began to wean ourselves off foreign oil. We doubled our production of clean energy. We brought more of our troops home to their families, and we delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program. We opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our children. We put policies in place to help students with loans, protect consumers from fraud, cut veterans' homelessness almost in half. And through countless acts of quiet courage, America learned that love has no limits, and marriage equality is now a reality across the land.\nBy so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started. And through every victory and every setback, I've insisted that change is never easy and never quick, that we wouldn't meet all of our challenges in one term or one Presidency or even in one lifetime.\nSo tonight I'm here to tell you that, yes, we've still got more work to do. More work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a decent retirement; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty or a world-class education; for everyone who has not yet felt the progress of these past 7½ years. We need to keep making our streets safer and our criminal justice system fairer, our homeland more secure, our world more peaceful and sustainable for the next generation. We're not done perfecting our Union or living up to our founding creed that all of us are created equal, all of us are free in the eyes of God.\nAnd that work involves a big choice this November. I think it's fair to say, this is not your typical election. It's not just a choice between parties or policies, the usual debates between left and right. This is a more fundamental choice: about who we are as a people, and whether we stay true to this great American experiment in self-government.\nLook, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's precisely this contest of idea that pushes our country forward. But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican, and it sure wasn't conservative. What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems, just the fanning of resentment and blame and anger and hate.\nAnd that is not the America I know. The America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous. Sure, we have real anxieties: about paying the bills and protecting our kids, caring for a sick parent. We get frustrated with political gridlock and worry about racial divisions. We are shocked and saddened by the madness of Orlando or Nice. There are pockets of America that never recovered from factory closures; men who took pride in hard work and providing for their families who now feel forgotten; parents who wonder whether their kids will have the same opportunities that we had.\nAll of that is real. We are challenged to do better; to be better.\nBut as I've traveled this country, through all 50 States, as I've rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I have also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America. I see people working hard and starting businesses. I see people teaching kids and serving our country. I see engineers inventing stuff, doctors coming up with new cures. I see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, not constrained by what is, ready to seize what ought to be.\nAnd most of all, I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together: Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love. That's what I see. That's the America I know!\nAnd there is only one candidate in this race who believes in that future, has devoted her life to that future; a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children thrive; a leader with real plans to break down barriers and blast through glass ceilings and widen the circle of opportunity to every single American: the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Now, 8 years ago——\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. That's right!\nLet me tell you, 8 years ago, you may remember Hillary and I were rivals for the Democratic nomination. We battled for a year and a half. Let me tell you, it was tough, because Hillary was tough. I was worn out. [Laughter] She was doing everything I was doing, but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels. And every time I thought I might have had the race won, Hillary just came back stronger.\nBut after it was all over, I asked Hillary to join my team. And she was a little surprised. Some of my staff was surprised. [Laughter] But ultimately, she said yes, because she knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us. And for 4 years—for 4 years, I had a front-row seat to her intelligence, her judgment, and her discipline. I came to realize that her unbelievable work ethic wasn't for praise, it wasn't for attention; that she was in this for everyone who needs a champion. I understood that after all these years, she has never forgotten just who she's fighting for.\nHillary has still got the tenacity that she had as a young woman, working at the Children's Defense Fund, going door to door to ultimately make sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education.\nShe's still got the heart she showed as our First Lady, working with Congress to help push through a Children's Health Insurance Program that to this day protects millions of kids.\nShe's still seared with the memory of every American she met who lost loved ones on 9/11, which is why, as a Senator from New York, she fought so hard for funding to help first responders, to help the city rebuild; why, as Secretary of State, she sat with me in the Situation Room and forcefully argued in favor of the mission that took out bin Laden.\nYou know, nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office. You can read about it. You can study it. But until you've sat at that desk, you don't know what it's like to manage a global crisis or send young people to war. But Hillary has been in the room; she's been part of those decisions. She knows what's at stake in the decisions our Government makes, what's at stake for the working family, for the senior citizen, or the small-business owner, for the soldier, for the veteran. And even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people, and she keeps her cool, and she treats everybody with respect. And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits.\nThat is the Hillary I know. That's the Hillary I've come to admire. And that's why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman—not me, not Bill, nobody—more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. I hope you don't mind, Bill, but I was just telling the truth, man. [Laughter] And, by the way, in case you're wondering about her judgment, take a look at her choice of running mate. Tim Kaine is as good a man, as humble and as committed a public servant as anybody that I know. I know his family. I love Anne. I love their kids. He will be a great Vice President. He will make Hillary a better President, just like my dear friend and brother, Joe Biden, has made me a better President.\nNow, Hillary has real plans to address the concerns she's heard from you on the campaign trail. She's got specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in their company's profits, to help put kids in preschool and put students through college without taking on a ton of debt. That's what leaders do.\nAnd then, there's Donald Trump. [Laughter]\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo, vote.\nAudience members. Vote! Vote! Vote!\nThe President. You know, the Donald is not really a plans guy. [Laughter] He's not really a facts guy, either. He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of business men and women who've achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits and unpaid workers and people feeling like they got cheated.\nDoes anyone really believe that a guy who's spent his 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people is suddenly going to be your champion? Your voice?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. If so, you should vote for him. But if you're someone who's truly concerned about paying your bills, if you're really concerned about pocketbook issues and seeing the economy grow and creating more opportunity for everybody, then the choice isn't even close. If you want someone with a lifelong track record of fighting for higher wages and better benefits and a fairer Tax Code and a bigger voice for workers and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. And if you're rightly concerned about who's going to keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world, well, the choice is even clearer. Hillary Clinton is respected around the world, not just by leaders, but by the people they serve.\nI have to say this. People outside of the United States do not understand what's going on in this election. [Laughter] They really don't. Because they know Hillary. They've seen her work. She's worked closely with our intelligence teams, our diplomats, our military. She has the judgment and the experience and the temperament to meet the threat from terrorism. It's not new to her. Our troops have pounded ISIL without mercy, taking out their leaders, taking back territory. And I know Hillary won't relent until ISIL is destroyed. She will finish the job. And she will do it without resorting to torture or banning entire religions from entering our country. She is fit and she is ready to be the next Commander in Chief.\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump calls our military a disaster. Apparently, he doesn't know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. He suggests America is weak. He must not hear the billions of men and women and children, from the Baltics to Burma, who still look to America to be the light of freedom and dignity and human rights. He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, tells our NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection.\nWell, America's promises do not come with a price tag. We meet our commitments. We bear our burdens. That's one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did 8 years ago when I took office.\nAmerica is already great. America is already strong. And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump. In fact, it doesn't depend on any one person. And that, in the end, may be the biggest difference in this election: the meaning of our democracy.\nRonald Reagan called America \"a shining city on a hill.\" Donald Trump calls it \"a divided crime scene\" that only he can fix. It doesn't matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they've been in decades, because he's not actually offering any real solutions to those issues. He's just offering slogans, and he's offering fear. He's betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election.\nAnd that's another bet that Donald Trump will lose. And the reason he'll lose it is because he's selling the American people short. We're not a fragile people. We're not a frightful people. Our power doesn't come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way. We don't look to be ruled. Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that we the people can form a more perfect Union.\nThat's who we are. That's our birthright: the capacity to shape our own destiny. That's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny and our GIs to liberate a continent. It's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot, and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma, and workers to organize and fight for collective bargaining and better wages.\nAmerica has never been about what one person says he'll do for us. It's about what can be achieved by us, together, through the hard and slow and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately enduring work of self-government.\nAnd that's what Hillary Clinton understands. She knows that this is a big, diverse country. She has seen it. She's traveled. She's talked to folks. And she understands that most issues are rarely black and white. She understands that even when you're a hundred percent right, getting things done requires compromise; that democracy doesn't work if we constantly demonize each other. She knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other and see ourselves in each other and fight for our principles, but also fight to find common ground, no matter how elusive that may sometimes seem.\nHillary knows we can work through racial divides in this country when we realize the worry Black parents feel when their son leaves the house isn't so different than what a brave cop's family feels when he puts on the blue and goes to work; that we can honor police and treat every community fairly. We can do that. And she knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isn't making race relations worse; it's creating the possibility for people of good will to join and make things better.\nHillary knows we can insist on a lawful and orderly immigration system while still seeing striving students and their toiling parents as loving families, not criminals or rapists; families that came here for the same reason our forebears came: to work and to study and to make a better life, in a place where we can talk and worship and love as we please. She knows their dream is quintessentially American, and the American Dream is something no wall will ever contain. These are the things that Hillary knows.\nIt can be frustrating, this business of democracy. Trust me, I know. Hillary knows too. When the other side refuses to compromise, progress can stall. People are hurt by the inaction. Supporters can grow impatient and worry that you're not trying hard enough, that you've maybe sold out. But I promise you, when we keep at it, when we change enough minds, when we deliver enough votes, then progress does happen. And if you doubt that, just ask the 20 million more people who have health care today. Just ask the marine who proudly serves his country without hiding the husband that he loves.\nDemocracy works, America, but we got to want it, not just during an election year, but all the days in between.\nSo if you agree that there's too much inequality in our economy and too much money in our politics, we all need to be as vocal and as organized and as persistent as Bernie Sanders supporters have been during this election. We all need to get out and vote for Democrats up and down the ticket and then hold them accountable until they get the job done.\nThat's right, feel the Bern!\nIf you want more justice in the justice system, then we've all got to vote, not just for a President, but for mayors and sheriffs and State's attorneys and State legislators. That's where the criminal law is made. And we've got to work with police and protesters until laws and practices are changed. That's how democracy works.\nIf you want to fight climate change, we've got to engage not only young people on college campuses, we've got to reach out to the coal miner who's worried about taking care of his family, the single mom worried about gas prices.\nIf you want to protect our kids and our cops from gun violence, we've got to get the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, who agree on things like background checks to be just as vocal and just as determined as the gun lobby that blocks change through every funeral that we hold. That is how change happens.\nLook, Hillary has got her share of critics. She has been caricatured by the right and by some on the left. She has been accused of everything you can imagine—and some things that you cannot. [Laughter] But she knows that's what happens when you're under a microscope for 40 years. She knows that sometimes during those 40 years she's made mistakes, just like I have, just like we all do. That's what happens when we try. That's what happens when you're the kind of citizen Teddy Roosevelt once described: not the timid souls who criticize from the sidelines, but someone \"who is actually in the arena . . . who strives valiantly; who errs . . . but who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement.\"\nHillary Clinton is that woman in the arena. She's been there for us, even if we haven't always noticed. And if you're serious about our democracy, you can't afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue. You've got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isn't a spectator sport. America isn't about \"yes, he will.\" It's about \"yes, we can.\" And we're going to carry Hillary to victory this fall, because that's what the moment demands.\nAudience members. Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can! The President. Yes, we can. Not \"yes, she can.\" Not \"yes, I can.\" \"Yes, we can.\"\nYou know, there's been a lot of talk in this campaign about what America has lost, people who tell us that our way of life is being undermined by pernicious changes and dark forces beyond our control. They tell voters there's a \"real America\" out there that must be restored. This isn't an idea, by the way, that started with Donald Trump. It's been peddled by politicians for a long time, probably from the start of our Republic.\nAnd it's got me thinking about the story I told you 12 years ago tonight, about my Kansas grandparents and the things they taught me when I was growing up. See, my grandparents, they came from the heartland. Their ancestors began settling there about 200 years ago. I don't know if they had their birth certificates, but—[laughter]—they were there. And—[applause]. They were Scotch-Irish mostly: farmers, teachers, ranch hands, pharmacists, oil rig workers. Hardy, smalltown folk. Some were Democrats, but a lot of them—maybe even most of them—were Republicans. Party of Lincoln.\nAnd my grandparents explained that folks in these parts, they didn't like showoffs. They didn't admire braggarts or bullies. They didn't respect mean-spiritedness or folks who were always looking for shortcuts in life. Instead, what they valued were traits like honesty and hard work, kindness, courtesy, humility, responsibility, helping each other out. That's what they believed in. True things. Things that last. The things we try to teach our kids.\nAnd what my grandparents understood was that these values weren't limited to Kansas. They weren't limited to small towns. These values could travel to Hawaii. They could travel even to the other side of the world, where my mother would end up working to help poor women get a better life, trying to apply those values. My grandparents knew these values weren't reserved for one race. They could be passed down to a half-Kenyan grandson or a half-Asian granddaughter. In fact, they were the same values Michelle's parents, the descendants of slaves, taught their own kids, living in a bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. They knew these values were exactly what drew immigrants here, and they believed that the children of those immigrants were just as American as their own, whether they wore a cowboy hat or a yarmulke, a baseball cap or a hijab.\nAmerica has changed over the years. But these values that my grandparents taught me, they haven't gone anywhere. They're as strong as ever, still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith. They live on in each of us. What makes us American, what makes us patriots is what's in here. That's what matters.\nAnd that's why we can take the food and music and holidays and styles of other countries and blend it into something uniquely our own. That's why we can attract strivers and entrepreneurs from around the globe to build new factories and create new industries here. That's why our military can look the way it does: every shade of humanity, forged into common service. That's why anyone who threatens our values, whether Fascists or Communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.\nThat is America. That is America. Those bonds of affection, that common creed. We don't fear the future, we shape it. We embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own. That's what Hillary Clinton understands, this fighter, this stateswoman, this mother and grandmother, this public servant, this patriot. That's the America she's fighting for.\nAnd that is why I have confidence, as I leave this stage tonight, that the Democratic Party is in good hands. My time in this office, it hasn't fixed everything. As much as we've done, there's still so much I want to do. But for all the tough lessons I've had to learn, for all the places where I've fallen short, I've told Hillary, and I'll tell you, what's picked me back up every single time: It's been you, the American people.\nIt's the letter I keep on my wall from a survivor in Ohio who twice almost lost everything to cancer, but urged me to keep fighting for health care reform, even when the battle seemed lost. Do not quit.\nIt's the painting I keep in my private office, a big-eyed, green owl with blue wings, made by a 7-year-old girl who was taken from us in Newtown, given to me by her parents so I wouldn't forget, a reminder of all the parents who have turned their grief into action.\nIt's the small-business owner in Colorado who cut most of his own salary so he wouldn't have to lay off any of his workers in the recession, because, he said, \"that wouldn't have been in the spirit of America.\"\nIt's the conservative in Texas who said he disagreed with me on everything, but he appreciated that, like him, I try to be a good dad.\nIt's the courage of the young soldier from Arizona who nearly died on the battlefield in Afghanistan, but who has learned to speak again and walk again, and earlier this year, stepped through the door of the Oval Office on his own power to salute and shake my hand.\nIt is every American who believed we could change this country for the better, so many of you who'd never been involved in politics, who picked up phones and hit the streets and used the Internet in amazing new ways that I didn't really understand, but made change happen. You are the best organizers on the planet, and I am so proud of all the change that you made possible.\nTime and again, you've picked me up. And I hope sometimes I picked you up too. And tonight I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me. I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me. Because you're who I was talking about 12 years ago when I talked about hope. It's been you who fueled my dogged faith in our future, even when the odds were great, even when the road is long. Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\nAmerica, you've vindicated that hope these past 8 years. And now I'm ready to pass the baton and do my part as a private citizen. So this year, in this election, I'm asking you to join me, to reject cynicism and reject fear, and to summon what is best in us to elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States and show the world we still believe in the promise of this great Nation.\nThank you for this incredible journey. Let's keep it going. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-07-27", "title": "Remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}

And I've even gotten a few words in along the way.\nOn Tuesday night I was so happy to see that my \"explainer in chief\" is still on the job.\nI'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime.\nTo all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week, thank you. What a remarkable week it's been!\nWe heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton, and the man of hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership. And I'm better because of his friendship.\nWe heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden.\nHe spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people as only he can do.\nAnd first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching. And the president we elect is going to be their president, too.\nAnd for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator. And he will make our whole country proud as our vice president.\nAnd I want to thank Bernie Sanders.\nBernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.\nYou've put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong.\nAnd to all of your supporters here and around the country, I want you to know I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.\nOur country needs your ideas, energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together, now let's go out and make it happen together!\nMy friends, we've come to Philadelphia, the birthplace of our nation, because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story, but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.\nWhen representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king.\nThe Revolution hung in the balance, and somehow they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That's what made it possible to stand up to a king. That took courage, they had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.\nNow America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our Founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together.\nOur country's motto is E Pluribus Unum, out of many we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?\nWell, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other. He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way, from morning in America to midnight in America.\nHe wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!\nNow, we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge just as we always have. We will not build a wall; instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy.\nWe will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.\nYet, we know there is a lot to do. Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. There's too much inequality, too little social mobility, too much paralysis in Washington.\nToo many threats at home and abroad. But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges.\nWe have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.\nWe have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had.\nWe have the most powerful military, the most innovative entrepreneurs, the most enduring values, freedom and equality, justice and opportunity, we should be so proud that those words are associated with us.\nI have to tell you, as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America!\nSo don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says I alone can fix it.\nYes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting troops on the front lines, police officers and firefighters who run toward danger, doctors and nurses who care for us, teachers who change lives, entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem, mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe? He's forgetting every last one of us.\nAmericans don't say \"I alone can fix it.\" We say \"we'll fix it together!\"\nAnd remember, remember, our Founders fought a Revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.\n240 years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.\nThat's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.\nTwenty years ago I wrote a book called \"It Takes a Village.\" And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that? This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.\nAmerica needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That's why \"stronger together\" is not just a lesson from our history, it's not just a slogan for our campaign, it's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build, a country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nWhere you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what ZIP code you live in. A country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach, where families are strong, communities are safe and, yes, where love trumps hate.\nThat's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!\nNow, sometimes—sometimes—the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I'm not one of those people. I've been your first lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York, then I represented all of you as secretary of state.\nBut my job titles only tell you what I've done. They don't tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part.\nI get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.\nSo let me tell you. The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind, builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had, whatever God gave them and whatever life in America provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids.\nMy grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.\nBecause he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right. My dad, Hugh, made it to college, he played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had, and he did.\nMy mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share the entire year.\nThe lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me. No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.\nSo I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to- door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school. It just didn't seem possible in those days. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child.\nIt became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.\nSo we gathered facts, we built a coalition and our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.\nBut how? How do you make an idea like that real? You do it step by step, year by year, sometimes even door by door. My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage.\nBecause we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it's true. I sweat the details of policy, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs.\nBecause it's not just a detail if it's your kid, if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to you president, too.\nAfter the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who have inspired me, people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine, people like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night.\nI first met Ryan as a 7-year old. He was wearing a full-body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because I leaned over to lift him up. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country.\nLauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero.\nI was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.\nAnd in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.\nAnd you heard from Republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together!\nTonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union. The first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president!\nStanding here as my mother's daughter and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come. I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I'm happy for boys and men. Because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone.\nAfter all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit!\nSo let's keep going. Let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have!\nBut even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead.\nLet's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.\nNow, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\nOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private sector jobs, 20 million more Americans with health insurance, and an auto industry that just had its best year ever.\nNow, that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo, not by a long shot. We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.\nI've gone around the country talking to working families and I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them. Some of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work and work hard, but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them, period.\nDemocrats, we are the party of working people.\nBut we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help. So tonight I want to tell you how we will empower Americans to live better lives.\nMy primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States.\nFrom my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind, from our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian country to coal country, from communities ravaged by addiction, to regions hollowed out by plant closures.\nAnd here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.\nThat's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.\nAnd if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!\nI believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are, but too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.\nAnd I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.\nAnd I believe in science!\nI believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying, clean-energy jobs.\nI believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.\nComprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together. And it's the right thing to do.\nSo whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.\nIf you believe that companies should share profits, not pad executive bonuses, join us!\nIf you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us!\nIf you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us!\nIf you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and home-grown manufacturers, then join us!\nIf you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us!\nAnd yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us!\nThat's how we're going to make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nNow, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention? He spoke for 70-odd minutes—and I do mean odd—and he offered zero solutions. But we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed I love talking about mine.\nIn my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.\nBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all.\nWe will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\nIt's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts and students and families can't refinance their debts.\nAnd something we don't say often enough, sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.\nWe will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.\nWe will give small businesses, like my dad's, a boost, make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it you should be able to build it.\nAnd we will help you balance family and work. And you know what? If fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in!\nNow, here's the other thing.\nNow, we're not only going to make all of these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. And here's how: Wall Street, corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.\nThis is not because we resent success. But when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is. And we are going to follow the money.\nAnd if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back and we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home.\nNow, I imagine that some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good, but how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?\nWell, look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's exactly what I'll do as president.\nBut then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman, he must know something about the economy.\nWell, let's take a closer look, shall we? In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.\nNow, remember what the president said last night: Don't boo; vote!\nBut think of this. People who did the work and needed the money, not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them. And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president, put your faith in him and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away and left working people holding the bag.\nHe also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of \"America first\" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado, Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan, Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio, Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin?\nDonald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.\nNow, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.\nYou know, anyone—anyone—reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face, from Baghdad to Kabul to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando. We're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.\nSo it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance, looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home.\nKeeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. I'm proud that we've put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.\nNow we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel's security.\nI'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement. Now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.\nAnd I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.\nI've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.\nIt won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake we will prevail.\nNow, Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do.\" No, Donald, you don't.\nHe thinks he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster.\nWell, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country...including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.\nSo just ask yourself, do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation, when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he's challenged in a debate, when he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.\nA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons!\nI can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men, the ones moved by fear and pride.\nAmerica's strength doesn't come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be.\nAnd if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.\nI'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.\nWe will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.\nYou know, for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you, how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw family members of people killed by gun violence, on this stage. You heard, you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.\nI refuse to believe we can't find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country, not just on guns, but on race, immigration and more.\nAnd that starts with listening, listening to each other, trying as best we can to walk in each other's shoes. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable!\nLet's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses good-bye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\nAnd we will defend all our rights, civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities.\nAnd we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments, excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.\nThey thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says. Like when he called women pigs, or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage, or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war, like John McCain, a hero and a patriot who deserves our respect.\nNow, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things, could be like that. But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump, this is it.\nAnd in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: America is great because America is good!\nSo enough with the bigotry and the bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change, he's offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, to get your kids the opportunities they deserve.\nThe choice is clear, my friends. Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together. But I'm here to tell you tonight progress is possible. I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.\nAnd I know it from my own life. More than a few times I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother, too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door, go back out there, she said. And she was right.\nYou have to stand up to bullies. You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\nWe lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right no matter what. That's what we need to do together as a nation.\nAnd though we may not live to see the glory, as the song from the musical \"Hamilton\" goes, let us gladly join the fight, let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. That's why we're here, not just in this hall, but on this earth. The Founders showed us that and so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.\nThat is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.\nYes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose. So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans!\nLet's look to the future with courage and confidence. Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever!\nThank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!", "timestamp": "2016-07-28", "title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118773", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for corrections, marked with asterisks.\n1:37 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. So what is the White House reaction to Donald Trump encouraging Vladimir Putin to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm periodically asked about the controversial comments uttered by the Republican nominee for President, and I don't make a habit of responding. What I can just make clear in this case is what the Obama administration's approach to this issue is, and it's a pretty simple, common-sense one. The United States counters cyber threats targeting all Americans regardless of which political party they belong to. And that's consistent with the national security approach that's been taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents for virtually our nation's entire history.\nQ: There's been a lot of concern about his comments, though. I guess my question is if you think that's overblown.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, particularly now, and particularly this week, there's active political debate about the claims and rhetoric that are used by candidates on both sides. And I'll let others do that. But when it comes to our national security, and when it comes to President Obama's approach to national security, we're going to do everything we can to protect the American people without regard to which political party they belong to or who they voted for in the last election.\nQ: Harry Reid today came out and said that intelligence agencies should withhold briefings for Donald Trump, in part as a result of his comments. Is that something that the White House thinks should be done?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has made clear that ensuring a smooth transition to the next President is a top priority, and it's certainly one of his top priorities for his last six months in office. And that requires a lot of advance preparation. And I can tell you that White House staff and agency staff all across the federal government are already working on the steps and procedures related to ensuring a smooth transition from one President to another.\nAnd that's important, in part because of the significant threats around the world. For more than 60 years now, the intelligence community has offered briefings to the presidential nominees of the two major political parties in an effort to facilitate a smooth transition. Again, in the same way that the Obama administration isn't going to start planning for the transition after the election, we're going to take steps in advance, the intelligence community is going to do the same thing in terms of preparing the potential next President. And they're doing that based on a tradition that's been in place for more than 60 years.\nSo the Director of National Intelligence has indicated he intends to conduct those briefings pursuant to that longstanding tradition, and he certainly is supported by this administration and this White House in doing so. What's also true of the intelligence community is they understand what steps are necessary to protect sensitive national security information. And the administration is confident that they can both provide relevant and sufficient briefings to the two major party presidential candidates while also protecting sensitive national security information.\nThe one other thing that I'll clarify, just to make sure that everybody understands this, is Director Clapper has also publicly indicated that his expectation is to provide the same information to both nominees. And that certainly seems appropriate.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, Russia said today that the U.S. needs to handle this hacking issue on its own, responding to both comments by Donald Trump and others. Has there been any diplomatic exchange about this between Russia and the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take that in a couple different ways. The first is I want to be careful of trying to answer these questions that we're all cognizant of the fact that there is an ongoing FBI investigation into the cyber breach at the DNC, and so I'm going to be as circumspect as I can out of a desire to protect the integrity of that ongoing investigation. I just don't want to say anything that could be perceived even as having some kind of influence over the course of that investigation.\nThat investigation, as always, is being led by the investigators who will follow the facts, and they'll do so without regard to politics. I think the political sensitivities here are obvious, and that's why I'm trying to go to great lengths here to make clear exactly how this is being handled.\nSo separate from that, so the reason I'm making that point right now is that the FBI has not revealed any information about who may have perpetrated the cyber intrusion at the DNC. There's plenty of speculation out there. I recognize there's been an analysis done that has indicated that the Russians are likely to blame, but that is not a conclusion that the FBI has chosen to publicize at this point. They're conducting an ongoing investigation, and so I'll let them speak to whether or not they've made such a determination, and I'll let them speak to whether they believe it's appropriate to go public with such a determination.\nThat all said, I do understand that Secretary of State Kerry indicated, after his meeting with his Russian counterpart, that he had raised cybersecurity issues with Mr. Lavrov. That certainly is not the first time that senior-level U.S. government officials have raised significant concerns about Russian activities in cyberspace. In fact, just yesterday -- I believe it was yesterday, maybe it was two days ago -- the President's top homeland security advisor, Lisa Monaco, gave a speech at the International Conference on Cybersecurity up in New York, and in that speech, she noted \"The global landscape is increasingly diverse and dangerous. Nations like Russia and China are growing more assertive and sophisticated in their cyber operations.\"\nMike Rogers, who is the Director of the NSA and the Commander of Cyber Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year. He said \"Russia has very capable cyber operators who can and do work with speed, precision and stealth. Russia is also home to a substantial segment of the world's most sophisticated cyber criminals who have found victims all over the world.\" You've heard similar comments -- I'll spare you the quotes for now, at least -- from Director Clapper, Secretary Carter, and other senior U.S. officials.\nThe reason I cited those quotes, Jeff -- and we can go through other -- do more of them if it's necessary -- to make clear that the Obama administration has been mindful of the cyber threat emanating from Russia for quite some time. And that threat takes a variety of forms. In some cases, as the Director of the NSA indicated, there are actors that are both affiliated with the state, and some actors that are affiliated with criminal organizations, and occasionally, those two actors will have different motives in conducting their operations.\nIn all cases, the Obama administration and the United States government is committed to countering those threats, whether they emanate from Russia or anywhere else. And we will do so to protect all of the American people without regard to the political party that they support.\nQ: So it is safe to conclude that Russia and the United States have had diplomatic exchanges about this hacking topic, with both regard to what the Republican nominee has said about it and with regard to the investigation related to the DNC?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to the conversation that Secretary Kerry had with his counterpart. I do know that within the course of that conversation Secretary Kerry did something that he did not do for the first time, which is raise concerns with his Russian counterpart about some of Russia's activities in cyberspace. I can't speak with any more specificity than that.\nAnd those are messages that we've delivered both in private and in public in the past. And I gave you a couple of examples of the public expressions of concern we have about Russia's activity in cyberspace and the potential threat it poses to U.S. citizens and U.S. national security.\nQ: Briefly, on one other topic, China said today it will hold routine naval exercises in the South China Sea with Russia in September. Is the United States convinced that those are routine? And is that announcement generally a concern, or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any insight into what sort of exercises they're planning. What I can tell you is that the United States conducted some exercises with Chinese military officials and Chinese military forces in the Pacific earlier this year. Just last week, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Richardson, was in China interacting with his counterparts and even touring some Chinese military facilities in China. So that kind of military-to-military relationship is not just one that exists between China and Russia, it's also a relationship that exists between the U.S. military and the Chinese military.\nSo I don't know what exercises they are planning, but in the same way that the United States and China have a military-to-military relationship, I'm not surprised to hear that Russia and China are seeking to build on their military-to-military relationship, as well.\nQ: But this is the South China Sea, which is a disputed --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there's no denying that this is a region of the world that is a sensitive diplomatic topic right now. But again, that doesn't change the nature of the military-to-military relationship that the United States and China have. And I'll let Chinese and Russian officials speak to the nature of their military-to-military relationship, but that's not a particularly new development.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to ask first about the reported split between al Nusra and al Qaeda. It's a move that seems designed to sort of embed al Nusra more with the broader Syrian insurgency. And so I'm wondering if there's a concern that doing so risks al Nusra, through their influence, radicalizing more moderate Sunni insurgent groups; it's going to complicate our ongoing talks with Russia about a political transition in Syria; and how, or what our plans are to distinguish al Nusra from sort of the other insurgency groups that we've sought to protect to some extent.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, I think it's worth remembering from the beginning that it's a direct result of Bashar al Assad's failed leadership that extremist organizations have sought a safe haven inside of Syria. Extremist organizations like al Nusra, like ISIL and others, seek to take root amid the chaos. And that is deeply destabilizing, as we saw with ISIL's advance over the border with Iraq.\nWe've also seen that it poses a real national security risk to the United States and our allies. And our allies in Europe have been targeted and innocent people have been killed by individuals who traveled to Iraq and in Syria, got training, equipment, support, and then traveled back to the West and carried out terrorist attacks, killing innocent people.\nSo the fact is that the extremist threat that exists inside of Syria is one that is serious and concerning to the United States and to our allies. That's why you've seen such a robust response on the part of the Obama administration, building a coalition of about 67 countries and entities to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nBut it's not just ISIL that we've been focused on. On the very first day that President Obama, in late summer of 2014, authorized military action inside of Syria, U.S. military fighter pilots also hit extremist targets not affiliated directly with ISIL. So we've been mindful of the extremist threat in Syria literally since the first day of our military operations there.\nThat all said, you will be surprised to hear me express some skepticism about the claims that you just cited. The United States continues to asses that Nusra Front leaders maintain the intent to conduct eventual attacks in and against the West and there continues to be increasing concern about Nusra Front's growing capacity for external operations that could threaten both the United States and Europe. So President Obama and the rest of the Obama administration and our military actions have been focused on and directed against a variety of extremist groups inside of Syria, including both ISIL and the Nusra Front.\nQ: I guess the question is more if -- I'm not surprised the United States will continue to distinguish between al Nusra and other opposition groups. But as they're clouding the picture on the ground in Syria, is there a concern among the administration that that will complicate our efforts either to negotiate a sort of political solution, or to win the hearts and minds of the Syrian people as we're trying to garner that if our attacks on al Nusra are seen as in a way bolstering the Assad regime?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, what I think is true is that you're accurately citing some of the complexities on the ground as it relates to the security situation and the political situation inside of Syria. I think what I would say is those complexities aren't significantly changed by this newly issued public denial from leaders of the Nusra Front.\nQ: I wanted to ask about something else. Kind of buried in Donald Trump's press conference yesterday, he said that he'd look at the possibility of recognizing Crimea as Russian and at the possibility of lifting sanctions against Moscow. I'm wondering both if you have a reaction to that, but also if you've heard any alarm from U.S. allies that obviously faced tough domestic policies to keep those sanctions in place.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't been informed of any diplomatic communications in response to that political rhetoric. Again, I'll let -- there are plenty of others, particularly this week, who are on duty responding to controversial comments uttered by the Republican presidential nominee, so I'll let others handle that.\nBut with regard to the policy of the Obama administration, since early 2014, the United States and the rest of the international community has been deeply concerned about Russia's flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including by attempting to annex Crimea. That is an action that wasn't just not recognized by the international community, it actually prompted an aggressive response from the international community in the form of well-coordinated and integrated sanctions that have placed economic pressure on Russia.\nThere are also sanctions that have been targeted by the United States Treasury Department against certain entities -- Russian entities operating in Crimea and other Crimean entities that were complicit. So the United States has been very direct about our view that the attempted annexation of Crimea by Russia is a flagrant violation, an egregious violation, of international norms. And it's not a violation that the United States is prepared to tolerate.\nIt also, by the way, is not an international violation that most of Europe is prepared to tolerate. And that is why you've seen the United States and Europe be able to coordinate so effectively to impose sanctions against Russia, to impose costs against them for this action. And the international commitment to that principle is rock solid.\nThere was some doubt early on, you'll recall, that once these sanctions were put in place -- the biggest bulk of which, the most far-reaching of which were imposed in the fall of 2014 -- there was a lot of doubt about whether or not the United States would be able to maintain political support among the Europeans for keeping those sanctions in place. But yet that's exactly what we've done almost two years later. And I think that's an indication not just of the skillful diplomacy of the Obama administration and the State Department, it also is an indication that European leaders share some deep concern about Russia's actions inside of Ukraine, including the attempted annexation of Crimea.\nQ: Last quick one on Russia, as well. Vice President Biden described Vladimir Putin as a dictator last night in the speech. I'm wondering if that's the administration's policy towards the Russians.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that there is a -- first of all, there is no official government designation about dictatorships, but there was included in the State Department Human Rights report a description of the political situation inside of Russia, with regard to the Russian government. And so I'll just read from it: \"The Russian Federation has a highly centralized authoritarian political system dominated by President Vladimir Putin.\" That's a direct quote. It went on to say that Russia's institutions \"lacked independence from the executive branch.\"\nSo that's the official language that's used by the U.S. government to describe the system of government that is currently in place in Russia.\nQ: And then I guess just to put a finer point on it -- does President Obama believe that Vladimir Putin is a dictator?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you'd be hard-pressed to draw a distinction between the word that Vice President Biden used and the language that was included in the State Department report.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Looking ahead to September, when Congress returns, what would the White House like for Congress to do first? What needs to be done?\nMR. EARNEST: There are so many things that they left town --\nQ: How do you categorize it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, maybe, I guess, first I would say that they left a day early, and maybe they'll come back a day early. We'll see. There's plenty of work to be done. I think the President has made clear what some of his priorities are, and I think if we saw forward movement on any of them in that first day that they're back, we would welcome that sign of progress.\nThe first thing that comes to mind, of course, is Zika. Five months ago, the Obama administration sent up to Congress a specific proposal at the request of our public health professionals about outlining the resources that they need to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus. And Republicans in Congress have not succeeded in passing legislation to do that. And that means that our public health professionals both at the federal government but also at the state and local level are not getting the support that they need to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus.\nThe President is quite concerned about this situation. The President, earlier this week, had a telephone conversation with the Governor of Florida. Based on public reports, there are now four suspected cases of non-travel-related Zika transmission. And that's concerning because of the threat that that virus poses to pregnant women and newborn children. So congressional action on that would certainly be welcomed.\nBut the Obama administration has also been pressing Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that actually includes funding to fight opioid addiction. There's been a lot of talk from Republicans about this being a priority. We haven't actually seen Republicans do anything significant when it comes to providing resources that are necessary to expand treatment options for the thousands of Americans who are fighting an opioid addition.\nCriminal justice reform; approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There are a wide variety of priorities, but I guess progress on any of those four on the first day would be welcomed.\nQ: And also, just the regular annual appropriations bills are still standing. So do you see September as sort of a money battle with Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know. I suspect it's going to be a dysfunction battle if the first eight months of this year is any indication. Republicans in Congress promised that if they were given the opportunity to run the United States Congress that they would get Congress moving again. And that was the subject of an op-ed that was penned by the Senate Majority Leader on the day after the last midterm elections. And as you point out, they haven't passed the budget bills yet this year through both houses of Congress. And there are a whole bunch of legislative priorities, some of which I mentioned, that should be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together, but the truth is, right now Republicans can't even work together among themselves to make progress on these priorities.\nSo I don't really know what September holds. But the pressure will certainly be on Republicans who worked hard and campaigned hard for the responsibility of running the United States Congress. Thus far, they've failed to perform that duty very effectively. And in expressing that view, I don't think that's the minority opinion when you consider that the approval rating of Congress right now is in the teens.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You'd mentioned pressure -- there may be a great deal of pressure tonight on Secretary Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: She's up to it.\nQ: Yeah? You think? Because I think it would be fair to say that the First Lady and the President both hit homeruns. I would say the pressure is on. Do you expect she'll hit a homerun? And what do you think she'll touch on tonight?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I haven't been briefed about her speech, so I'd refer you to her campaign to talk to you about the kinds of things that she'll prioritize in I think what everybody would acknowledge is an important opportunity for any candidate when you're speaking to a live television primetime audience.\nQ: Will you be satisfied with a double?\nMR. EARNEST: I think both Mrs. Obama and President Obama made a forceful case for why they believe -- why they're strongly supporting Secretary Clinton's campaign, and that's based on their knowledge of what's required of the job of President, but also based on their personal knowledge of Secretary Clinton's character. So that's why I would expect the President to watch the speech tonight. And he'll do so with a lot of confidence in the candidate that he's endorsed.\nQ: I want to ask you about Gitmo. I know on occasion we'll get an update on the number. Do you have anything to announce in terms of more detainees being moved, as we get ever closer to the President's summer break?\nMR. EARNEST: I did get an updated count here. Again, the detainee population at Gitmo is 76, 32 that have been approved for transfer that are awaiting transfer at this point.\nI don't have any updates in terms of potential transfers that may be upcoming, but once those transfers have taken place, we'll announce them publicly so that you can certainly be aware of the steps that we continue to take to reduce the population of the prison at Guantanamo Bay in the hopes of eventually closing it.\nQ: If I could, I want to draw your attention the Pope's comments about the war on terror, broadly speaking. He said as a matter of fact that \"the world is at war,\" but he didn't think it was a war of religions. Does the President share his viewpoint? And what's his reaction to what the Pope had to say in the wake of the latest terror attacks in Europe?\nMR. EARNEST: I was just going to mention that, Kevin. Obviously, the American people and everybody here at the White House offers our profound condolences to loved ones of the Catholic priest that was killed by apparent ISIL sympathizers in France earlier this week. It's a tragedy. And I know that Pope Francis is mourning the loss of that Catholic priest, and the rest of us are, as well.\nMore generally, I will acknowledge I did not see the Pope's comments before I came out here. But based on what you have relayed, it sounds like it's quite consistent with the position of the Obama administration and what President Obama himself has articulated, which is it's a fantasy for ISIL to suggest that they represent Islam in a fight against the world.\nThe fact is ISIL has declared war against the rest of the world, but they don't represent Islam. They represent a perverted, nihilistic world view that promises nothing but chaos and violence. And President Obama, I think like Pope Francis, continues to be confident that while that threat needs to be taken seriously, that the rest of the world, including the Muslim world, will prevail over the deeply dark, violent vision that's put forward by ISIL.\nDevin.\nQ: Hey, Josh. Thanks. A couple questions about the speech last night. One, I wanted to ask you about one line from the President. He said, \"Anyone who threatens our values with their fascist, communist, jihadist, or homegrown demagogues will always fail in the end.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Great line.\nQ: Interesting line. When he was talking about demagogues, was he referring to Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that as I was listening to the speech, it seemed clear to me that each of the categories that the President was describing, that the President didn't have one person in mind. The President didn't have one jihadi in mind; the President didn't have one fascist in mind; the President didn't have one domestic demagogue in mind. The President was talking about how, over the course of our country's history, by adhering to our core American values, we've overcome threats emanating from individuals and organizations that could be aptly described using that criteria.\nQ: He has referred to Mr. Trump as a demagogue before. He believes that Trump is a demagogue or can be a demagogue?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure you could do a Google search to see if the President has used that word directly in response to Mr. Trump. I don't know if he's done that before or not. It's possible that he has.\nThat portion of the speech was focused on the kinds of values that our country has pursued and sought to advance throughout our history. And our steadfast commitment to those values has served our country and our people quite well.\nAnd, look, the President ended his speech, I thought, in a way that was really powerful in terms of talking about the values of his mother's family in Kansas. That's a small-town community, El Dorado -- a place I've been to before, actually, not too far away from Kansas City. But this is typical of small towns all across the country that prioritize and value people who are humble, people who are kind, people who are generous, people who are honest, people who are unselfish. And those are the kinds of values that are rooted not just in the small towns in Kansas, though they certainly are. But those values transcend region. Those values transcend faith. Those values transcend political party. Those values transcend generations. Generations of Americans have been committed to those values. That's served our country really well.\nAnd this is the kind of rhetoric that the President used in his very first convention speech in 2004, and that's got a deep resonance today. And I think that's in some ways -- it's not uncommon for you all to ask a legitimate question in here about the President's view of a divided America. And that passage of the speech, that four or five paragraphs near the end, it's probably the most effective rebuttal of that question I've ever heard. And it certainly does reflect the President's deeply held view. And it's one that -- frankly, this is a view that he had before he was elected President, before he ran for President. And the fact that he is as committed to those values as ever, and the way that he sees the American people be committed to those values, is what gives him such strong optimism about the future of our country.\nQ: And does he think Donald Trump threatens those values?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly are some rhetoric that we've heard on the other side of the aisle that contradicts those values. There is no denying that. But again, that's something that other people will have to decide in terms of whether or not that influences their decision in November.\nQ: And just one more, quick follow. I was in touch with a number of servicemembers last night during the speech, a couple who are in theater, several who are here. And one of things that struck them was that the President did not mention -- as he has in all of his previous DNC speeches -- the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and troops who are in harm's way right now. And I was wondering if there's any kind of reason why the President didn't specifically mention those wars and the troops, aside from the fight against ISIL.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, Devin, I think the President certainly did talk about how disappointed he was to hear rhetoric on the other side of the aisle that describes the United States military as a disaster. In fact, the President described the United States military and the men and women who serve in it as the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. That was included in his speech.\nThe President was introduced to the stage yesterday, last night, by a woman whose son served and gave his life for the United States in Afghanistan. And she told I thought a pretty powerful story about the way that the President has honored her son's sacrifice and her family's sacrifice for the country.\nSo I think speeches to a political convention are a little different than speeches, for example in the context of a State of the Union, where there's a set of issues that has to be covered. But I think the President made clear his deep appreciation for the service of our men and women in uniform who are serving our country all around the world, including right now in Iraq and Afghanistan, to keep us safe.\nChip.\nQ: Josh, thank you. On that same line, \"fascists, communists, jihadists, and homegrown demagogues.\"\nMR. EARNEST: You liked that line, too? (Laughter.)\nQ: It certainly did stick out. I would venture to guess that probably about everybody who heard that speech --\nMR. EARNEST: That's part of what made it so great.\nQ: -- when he said \"homegrown demagogues\" thought of Donald Trump. So even if you're right that he was not referring to one individual, he was certainly grooving Donald Trump into that group of homegrown demagogues. You would concede that?\nMR. EARNEST: I would concede that most of the President's speech was not geared toward subtlety. (Laughter.) I think the American people --\nQ: I'll take that as a yes.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the American people understood quite directly the argument that the President was making. And the argument that he was making did not have -- particularly in that line -- did not have one single person in mind, but rather was talking about the kinds of values that generations of Americans have subscribed to --\nQ: He certainly put Donald Trump in the minds of the people who were listening. And he had to know he was going to do that.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, again, I'm not suggesting that the President was trying to be subtle. I think the President was quite direct in the argument that he was making.\nQ: But my question is, if Donald Trump was one of the \"homegrown demagogues\" he was referring to there, I know he doesn't think much about Donald Trump, but is it fair to group him with \"fascists, communists, and jihadists\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what is fair is that the kinds of values that generations of Americans have been committed to and fought and died for have served our country quite well. It is the reason that people all around the world look to the United States as a beacon of freedom. It is the reason that people from all around the world travel to the United States. They desire to be a part of our country. They desire to be citizens of our country. It's the reason that that diverse population signs up to serve this country in the military. And those values are what allowed the United States, for example, to defeat fascism in World War II.\nThose are the kinds of values that we have followed even as we have overcome the threat from terrorism. And it requires vigilance. It also requires a firm commitment to those same values, again, that transcend faith, that transcend region, that transcend generations, that transcend party. And it speaks to the unique character of the United States and the people who live here.\nQ: And just one other. I want to follow up on Justin's question about Crimea. You've covered the global politics of that issue pretty well. But what does the President think -- or if you haven't talked to the President -- what does the White House think about the fact that a possible future President of the United States would say that maybe we should lift the sanctions, I'm looking into it; and I'm looking into allowing -- recognizing Crimea as Russian territory?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not spoken to the President about it, but I know the President believes that in order to counter Russia's flagrant violation of Ukraine sovereignty, we need to preserve and present a united front.\nAnd at each step in mobilizing the international community to respond to this situation, President Obama has worked closely with our allies in Europe to ensure, for example, that in diplomatic exchanges with Russia about the situation in Ukraine, that the international community is on the same page. Obviously, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande have played a prominent role in all of that, in the context of the Normandy Group discussions.\nBut what's also clear is that as the international community has pursued sanctions to impose costs on Russia for violating Ukraine's sovereignty that that's required effective coordination in the international community, as well. The point that we've made on a number of occasions is that the United States -- even if those sanctions were in place -- doesn't do a whole lot of business directly with Russia when you compare it to the economic ties between Germany and Russia, or Italy and Russia, or even France and Russia.\nQ: Right, but I'm just asking, is it acceptable for a presidential candidate to say what Donald Trump said about Crimea? Is it acceptable?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm trying to get at, Chip, is I'm not going to be able to respond directly to his comments. But let me just finish this thought by saying our ability to pressure Russia and to send a clear message about how we will not tolerate the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty is predicated on our ability to coordinate effectively with our allies. That's why it would be a bad idea to unilaterally withdraw.\nThe United States ultimately has built a coalition that is imposing costs against Russia for violating those international norms. And the President believes strongly that the United States and our interests are better served by defending those international norms and coordinating with the international community to impose financial costs against Russia for violating them. And to unilaterally withdraw from that effort would weaken the United States.\nSuzanne.\nQ: I want to follow up with yesterday in Trump's comments. Trump said that he was being sarcastic when he called and encouraged Russian intelligence agencies to look into Hillary Clinton's emails -- deleted emails, the hacked emails, that they would be richly rewarded. So can you clarify here, is this something -- a lot of people saw this as beyond the pale, this was unacceptable, and at the very least irresponsible, coming from a presidential candidate. How does the White House see this? Is this something that you see that's just an off-the-cuff remark? Or is this something the White House is taking seriously as a national security concern?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question a couple different ways. The first is, I'll let the Republican nominee explain his comments and explain his motivation. And I'll let other people decide for themselves if they can figure out when Mr. Trump is being sarcastic and when he's being serious.\nWhat I can speak to is the policy of the administration, and it's a pretty simple one. It's one I think is pretty intuitive, one that we're all familiar with because it's the same one that's been pursued by Presidents of both parties since our nation's founding, which is that the United States of America is committed to defending the American people without regard to which political party they belong to. And that certainly is true when it comes to our efforts to protect the American people in cyberspace.\nQ: So what does that mean, Josh? I mean, people who want to know, is there any consequence, is there any reaction, is there any fallout to what he said -- is the White House taking what he said seriously?\nMR. EARNEST: And I guess my point is I'll let others react to the controversial comments of the Republican nominee. I can be here to help you understand exactly what our policy is and how significant or how important that policy is. And when it comes to protecting the American people against all threats, including threats that emanate from overseas, including threats that exist in cyberspace, this country and this government is committed to protecting our citizens without first asking which political party they belong to.\nQ: So is there any move afoot for White House officials to question the candidate or question the campaign at whether or not that was something that was, in fact, something that was real and acceptable? Or is it considered a national security issue? Does this administration consider it a national security issue, the comments that he made?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'll let other people characterize his comments. I'll let him explain them as best he can. But for me, we're just going to stick to articulating what our policy is, and I think the differences in our policy and the rhetoric that is being put forward by the other side is quite different.\nQ: And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, has said that there's going to be a lot more material that's relevant to the U.S. election that could come out. Is there anything that the administration is doing to prepare or respond to in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not that I'm aware of. And I'm not sure that anybody is quite sure what Mr. Assange is talking about.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, on the issue of hacking, in this cyber age, is there any reason to be surprised or outraged that foreign governments engage in hacking for intelligence gathering or mischief making?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question a couple different ways. The first is, in the interview that President Obama did earlier this week, he acknowledged that we have seen Russia engage in efforts to at least interfere in a democratic process in other countries, including in Europe. So we know that interfering in the political process in other countries is a tactic, or even a strategy, that President Putin has used before.\nThe other thing that some have observed is that in this instance, the information wasn't just hacked, it was also released. What that actually says about the potential perpetrator or their motive is something that the FBI will have to speak to. They're obviously conducting an investigation here, and I'll let them speak to it.\nBut I guess the other element of your question is how serious is this. And I think the fact that this is something that has drawn the attention of the FBI and their careful scrutiny and their coordination with experts across the federal government is an indication that a situation like this is certainly something that we take seriously.\nQ: Are you able to say if U.S. intelligence has a policy on hacking?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not able to say what sort of policy may be in place, but the Office of the Director of National Intelligence may be able to provide you with some information about that.\nQ: On last night's speech, did President Obama know Hillary Clinton was backstage and was going to join him on stage after his speech?\nMR. EARNEST: He did know that, yes.\nQ: And what did he do after the speech? There were about 40 minutes between the end of his speech and leaving the convention. What was he doing during that period?\nMR. EARNEST: President Obama had an opportunity to visit backstage with Secretary Clinton, members of her family. I believe he had an opportunity to see Senator Kaine. I actually wasn't backstage with him once he'd finished delivering his speech, but I know that there were a number of people backstage that he was eager to see and spend some time with.\nQ: And what's he doing today?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's schedule started a little later today, given the late-night arrival last night. The President is meeting with members of his national security team. He periodically, once a quarter or so, will receive an update on the terror threat picture, so he's meeting with members of his team to receive that update again today. And we'll have a readout of that meeting this afternoon.\nPaul.\nQ: Josh, thanks very much. Just a couple of quick ones. The President has kind of hinted about possibly getting involved in the post-presidential period in venture capital. What particular area in sort of the VC world has he expressed any particular interest in? And what is it about sort of the VC world that interests him do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: As I recall, the President talked about this in the interview that he did with Business Week. And there are some aspects of that line of work that appeals to some of the President's intellectual interests. There's obviously a lot of interesting work that's being done in the field of innovation and science that VCs are strongly supporting. As President of the United States, the President has an opportunity to be briefed on those kinds of -- on innovations and scientific developments. The President has got a council of advisors in science and technology, his PCAST, that he meets with frequently to get some updates on a variety of scientific innovations. And I know that he finds those conversations to be exceedingly interesting. And the intellectual rigor associated with those conversations is something that he genuinely enjoys.\nSo I think that's part of what the -- because that essentially was what would be part of -- I think part of what a venture capital operation would include is evaluating innovations and testing the likelihood of their success. So that, I guess, would be the other thing that I think that he's discussed appeals to him, is sort of the rigorous analysis of those kinds of ideas and plans. And again, that kind of rational consideration of options is something that the President doesn't get to do as often as he would like in Washington, D.C. Too often there is a rather irrational and dysfunctional evaluation of options that I think the President has previously spoken to as being a source of frustration.\nBut in the VC world there's a much more rigorous, cold-eyed analysis that's done, a rational decision-making structure is applied. And the President is pretty good at that and feels like that's something that he would both do well at and find to be incredibly interesting in his post-presidential life. I don't know if he'll actually do it. But having read the interview and having heard him talk about this a little bit, I think those are a couple of things that appeal to him about that line of work.\nQ: -- it's occurred to me that even in times that are far worse than today -- the dark era of the Civil War, the Great Depression -- Presidents then, Lincoln and Roosevelt, always spoke in terms of faith and optimism and hope for a future. Why is it, you think, that Donald Trump's darkness now is getting so much traction? We don't live in times nearly as bad as the times I mentioned. Why is he getting so much traction?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure. And I know that there are a lot of theories that have been floated out there. I'll let other people speculate about that. But I will acknowledge that I was thinking about this a little bit myself earlier today, and the thing that occurred to me is, we don't actually have to go that far back in our history to find an example of a time when the United States was facing a really tough challenge. When President Obama took office in 2009, the United States was on the brink of a second Great Depression. The U.S. auto industry was weeks away from utter collapse, costing millions of Americans -- at least a million Americans their jobs. There were hundreds of thousands of jobs that were being hemorrhaged from our economy every month.\nQ: But why are people responding to fear now and they didn't then? What's changed?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think -- stick with me on this. Even in the midst of what I would readily acknowledge was a scary time for our country in 2008 -- we saw these precipitous declines in the stock market; Congress had to vote for extraordinary legislation that would try to stabilize the financial system -- even in the midst of all of that, President Obama continued to articulate his hope, optimism and confidence in the future.\nThere's no denying -- even Mitch McConnell won't deny that our country is in a far better position now than we were then -- something that the Majority Leader has committed to publicly. And President Obama continues to have a lot of confidence in the country and is more optimistic than ever about the future of our country, in part because we weathered those hard times and we came out stronger on the other end. It doesn't mean there isn't a lot more work that needs to be done. And the President walked through some of those examples last night.\nSo, again, I can't account for the strategy that's being pursued by the Republican presidential nominee. But it's a lot different than the strategy that President Obama employed in 2008 and 2012, and I don't think it's a coincidence that President Obama is actually the first President since President Eisenhower to win two national elections back to back, earning a majority vote from the American people* [President Reagan won twice with a majority of the vote. President Obama won twice - getting more than 51% each time. He's the first President since Eisenhower to do so.]\nQ: I think you mean the first Democrat.\nMR. EARNEST: The first one since Eisenhower. He's actually the first President, Democrat or Republican, to get more than *50 [51] percent of the vote twice.\nQ: No, Reagan did it twice, actually.\nMR. EARNEST: Reagan did not do it twice.\nQ: He got 50.7 in 1980, if I'm correct. The final question --\nMR. EARNEST: I'll follow up with you on it. I'm confident the facts are on my side on this one.\nQ: Okay. I could be wrong. The final question is, historians were always ranking Presidents, and the numbers kind of move up and down. Right now there's sort of a general consensus that of the 43 men who have been President that Obama currently bounces around 19, 20, 21 -- sort of in the middle of the pack. Does that strike you about right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm sure I'm biased. So, look, I also am confident that historians will spend a lot of time considering the Obama presidency. And I think historians acknowledge that, with time, that it's easier to draw a more precise evaluation. What that means for the actual numbers is something that historians will determine.\nJane.\nQ: Thank you very much, Josh. Donald Trump has mentioned that when he's elected President of the United States, that he will withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. It seems like withdrawing troops from Korea, that it concerns the security of Korean Peninsula and the U.S.-South Korea relationship. What is the Democratic Party's view of withdrawal on Korean Peninsula?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States of America has an ironclad commitment to the security of our South Korean allies. That is a commitment that transcends party. I know that President Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush, was committed to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. I know that President Clinton was, as well. So there has been a longstanding tradition of holding that alliance as a high priority and committing the United States to the defense of our South Korean allies. That's the policy of the United States. It is a policy that benefits our national security. It's a policy that President Obama has prioritized. And if there are people who disagree with that policy, even people who are running for President, I'll let them make their own case.\nGoyal.\nQ: Thanks, two questions. One, as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned, President Obama has had a very cozy and personal relations with at least two prime ministers of India, including Dr. Manmohan Singh and now Prime Minister Modi. And not only business-to-business or country-to-country, but also on a personal basis. What do you think will be the future after he leaves? Because many, including these two prime ministers and millions of people in India will miss him.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, part of President Obama's Asia rebalance has included prioritizing the United States relationship with the world's largest democracy. And President Obama has traveled multiple times to India. And the President has been warmly received by the Indian people on each visit. I know that he's enjoyed each visit. And the President has appreciated the effective working relationship that he's had with the leaders of both countries.\nOf course, President and Mrs. Obama hosted Prime Minister Singh and his wife here at the White House for the very first White House state dinner. And President Obama was able to work effectively with Prime Minister Modi to reach an agreement about the commitments that India would make in the context of the Paris climate talks. That was viewed by many as the lynchpin of completing the agreement in Paris.\nSo I think it's an indication of the longstanding warm relationship between the United States and India. Some of that is a result of the deep investment of diplomatic capital that President Obama has made in that relationship. And he certainly is hopeful that his successor will do the same thing, because it benefits the American people and our economy, and certainly our national security.\nQ: Do you think the President will have a word with President Donald Trump or President Hillary Clinton, whoever will be in the White House, before he leaves regarding U.S.-India relations and the future of U.S.-India relations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what President Obama has indicated is that he is committed to ensuring a smooth transition from the Obama administration to his successor. And I'm confident that will include conversations between President Obama and the President-elect when the time comes. I don't know how wide-ranging that discussion will be. It certainly could include India. But whoever it is, President Obama is committed to ensuring a smooth transition.\nQ: And second, as far as hate in America and trust in America is concerned, millions of people in India, they think that there is no country -- and of course the Indian-American community here -- on Earth where there's a trust in America, or many people want to come here. Now, there's a program, Invest in America. And does the President support, the White House support this program? Because thousands of people in India are lining up to come to the U.S. and invest in America, which is close to $500,000 to $1 million for a green card or to be here. They feel safer, and there's law and order and justice in America.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Goyal, I'll admit I'm not familiar with that specific program. We can see if somebody around here is and can give you our perspective on it. We obviously -- and President Obama has made it a priority to seek out people who are committed to invested in the United States. Insourcing has been a top priority, and we certainly have welcomed the kind of investment that we've seen from countries around the world and from businesses around the world who recognize the opportunity that exists to invest in the United States. That obviously creates jobs and economic opportunity here in the United States, and we've gone to great lengths to try to encourage it.\nBrian, I saw you had your hand up. Do you want the last shot here?\nQ: Thanks. I actually wanted to ask about the transition also. Next week, the GSA has made office space available to the two candidates. And I'm just wondering, has the President said any -- given any specific marching orders or instructions to his agencies, to his people about how they should pursue -- or to what degree they should cooperate --\nMR. EARNEST: The President made clear at the beginning of this year that one of the top priorities of the federal government is to ensure the smooth transition from the Obama administration to the next administration. President Obama benefitted tremendously from the effective management and planning that was performed by his predecessor to ensure a smooth transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. It's one of the reasons that President Obama holds President Bush in high regard.\nPresident Bush was committed to that effective transition across political parties. And this is a testament to President Bush and his commitment to this country and to the institution of the presidency, and President Obama shares that commitment. President Obama has identified the same priority and has certainly used the strategy employed by President Bush as a template for his team. And so I can tell you that, for months, senior officials here at the White House have been engaged in planning, interacting with senior officials at a wide variety of government agencies to begin preparing now, months before the actual election, to ensure that that smooth transition takes place.\nAnd President Obama believes that this is what the American people can and should expect from their federal government.\nAll right? Thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:41 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-07-28", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118774", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for corrections, marked with asterisks.\n12:12 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. I apologize for starting out a little bit late. But let us get through this and then Mark can start on his weekend. (Laughter.)\nJosh, do you want to lead us off?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Eric. We learned this morning that the DCCC was hacked in addition to the DNC. I'm wondering if you can tell us if those two breaches were connected, and also if you have any sense of how far this goes. Does the DSCC, where you used to work, were they also involved in this? Do we know about other entities that might have also been impacted?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I saw reports of that early this morning as well. I'd refer you to the FBI for the scope of any investigation they are conducting. Obviously they've confirmed an investigation into the intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. I imagine those investigations are not conducted in isolation. So if there's connected events that they would look at, that would be part of their investigation. Obviously we expect that investigation to be thorough and deliberate and look at all the facts, and look at all the facts to where they lead.\nAs I think you heard yesterday, our Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, noted at an Aspen security forum -- a security forum in Aspen yesterday that they know that there's sort of usual list of suspects when it comes to malicious cyber activity, so they're looking at those suspects. But at this point, they don't have any public confirmation to announce at this time.\nQ: Do you have any comments about any diplomatic conversations that might have gone on with counterparts in Russia or in any other countries about these concerns that we've been talking about this week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any update or any additional conversations to tell you about. As I think we mentioned maybe yesterday, Secretary Kerry raised cyber activity with his counterpart when they had a meeting in Laos, I believe -- Foreign Minister Lavrov. As I think Secretary Kerry has noted, we've been concerned about Russia's activity in this space for quite some time. Those concerns are well catalogued. If you look at even as recently as early this week at a cybersecurity conference up in New York at Fordham University, the President's top homeland security advisor, Lisa Monaco, mentioned that Russia has a troubling past in this space. Admiral Mike Rogers of Cyber Command, in testimony just this past April, mentioned that Russia has very capable cyber operators who work with speed, precision and stealth.\nSo we have longstanding concerns on this. Secretary Kerry raised those concerns with Foreign Minister Lavrov. I suspect that won't be the last time they have a conversation about this.\nQ: And this morning, the Florida governor announced that there were four cases they've now found of Zika, contracted they believe from mosquitoes within the U.S. At the risk of eliciting your whole spiel about why Republicans should have acted on this -- that we're very familiar with -- does this particular development trigger any different type of response from the federal government? Particularly, are there any travel warnings that you're going to be issuing as far as pregnant women visiting that part of Florida, or anything else like that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I won't take your aspersion about my spiels personally. (Laughter.) But I will say the President was briefed this morning on this situation. This was part of his Presidential Daily Briefing. And the President has, of course, asked his team to keep him up to date.\nAs you know, the President was briefed, actually, on Wednesday, before departing for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. There was a briefing led by his Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, Amy Pope. The President also had a chance last week to speak with Governor Scott about this situation in Florida. So he has -- the President has directed his team to make sure not only the White House and the appropriate federal government agencies are closely monitoring this, but also that we're providing the resources and support to the governor that we can.\nI will give credit where it's due. Governor Scott has been preparing for this circumstance for quite some time. We've had aggressive vector control in place to limit the transmission with mosquitoes. In this particular case, they announced that they've isolated the area, that they're testing aggressively, and that they're going to closely monitor this area in the coming days.\nThey do this with the support of the administration. I think the numbers the CDC have put out is -- the CDC has given out $2 million to Florida in Zika-specific response. The CDC has also given out $27 million in emergency preparedness, much of which can be used for Zika response. But, Josh, as I think you alluded to earlier, we believe that's insufficient; that Congress has been sitting on a $1.9 billion that would fund -- more fully fund the federal response to this public health emergency. Unfortunately, they left town for seven weeks without doing anything on this. We find that regrettable.\nWe often get asked what is not being done because Congress hasn't approved those funds. That includes everything from hiring more inspectors on the ground. This is something that local governments in Florida have asked for, yet because Congress won't act, we're not able to supply enough funding for that. And also, long-term study -- a long-term international study -- I believe the National Institutes of Health has said they've had to suspend, or they won't be able to complete a long-term study on the health impacts of this virus. That's unfortunate. And today's news should be a wakeup call to Congress to get back to work.\nAyesha.\nQ: More on Zika. Right now, the CDC is recommending that women in areas where there's a Zika outbreak, or who are wanting to get pregnant, that they talk with their doctors and avoid mosquito bites and things of that nature. I was wondering, now that there does seem to be some local transmission, is there any planning or contingency planning, or consideration of eventually, if the outbreak were to get bad, recommending that American women not get pregnant for a while, or delay pregnancy, or delay getting pregnant in light of Zika in the area hit by Zika?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Ayesha, what we've said is that women should consult with their doctors and not the White House Press Secretary for personal health tips. But as I think Governor Scott said earlier today, this does appear to be a local area of transmission. But public health officials aren't taking any chances, and so that's why the local officials have begun aggressive vector control in this surrounding area. So they're going to be testing both mosquitos and residents. That testing is already underway. They're going to be closely monitoring this, and they're going to be closely coordinating with the CDC on testing to see if there's any additional resources that are needed.\nAgain, when the President spoke with Governor Scott last week, he said, let's keep the lines of communications open. Our principal channel for communicating with Florida on this has been through the CDC. So I know that they conduct a lot of business back and forth. But the President wanted to make sure that Governor Scott was getting the resources he needs, and that was a directive he issued to his team here at the White House.\nQ: On Turkey -- so, some U.S. officials have said that the purges currently going on in Turkey due to the failed coup are hurting U.S. cooperation with Turkey in the fight against the Islamic State. Turkish officials have kind of angrily rejected that criticism and accused the U.S. of maybe being in league -- or some in the U.S. of being in league with the plotters of the coup. I guess, does the White House have any response to that? And also, how concerned is the White House that these purges are affecting kind of the cooperation against the Islamic State?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good questions, Ayesha. Let me start by saying the U.S has strongly and repeatedly condemned the failed coup in Turkey. We've repeatedly expressed our support for President Erdogan, and we've expressed our support for Turkey's democratically elected government -- that respecting the democratic institutions in Turkey is a guiding principle for us, and that any speculation that either the U.S. was behind this or involved or aware, as the President said on Friday, is completely baseless.\nSo we reject any speculation. And the President also said on Friday that sort of fueling that speculation could impact our relationship with Turkey; that right now we do have a close relationship with Turkey. The President considers President Erdogan a close ally. We work together on a number of the President's international priorities. That includes our broad coalition to counter ISIL and ultimately defeat them. That includes -- obviously they're a NATO ally, so we have a lot of business we get done with Turkey.\nI will say they are -- our work on our counter-ISIL coalition continues in earnest. And that relationship continues to be strong. Obviously, our military leaders have a relationship with their counterparts in Turkey. That's how we're able to work so closely together. So I know that our Defense Department has addressed this. Obviously there were some interruptions in the intervening -- in the past week or so, which is understandable. If you can imagine, the people of Turkey have been shaken by what happened. The President has remarked that if a rump group of military officials tried to stage a coup and flew planes and tried to overthrow the government, it would shake us, too.\nSo the President has been responsive to that, but he's also called for restraint in how Turkey responds. He's called for a strong and abiding fidelity to Turkey's democratic institutions. These are principles like freedom of expression, like freedom of the press, freedom to gather, freedom to protest; that part of the strength of Turkey is their respect for democratic traditions. These are principles enshrined in the Turkish constitution. And the President wants to make sure that respect for those principles continues, even in the wake of this failed coup.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. The EU has called what Turkey has been doing in the wake of the coup \"unacceptable.\" Some have even called it a \"purge\" -- that they have fired or detained tens of thousands of people. So why has the U.S. not spoken out on those particular actions? Is it because the U.S. does not believe that those action are unacceptable, as the EU now does?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Michelle, I'd draw your attention to the President's remarks on Friday. He made clear that we are concerned by reports of the activities you're mentioning. The United States does strongly support freedom of expression around the world, and has concerns when a country makes a move to close down media outlets or restrict universal values. We respect the Turkish authorities to uphold their assurances to the President, and as they made to the public, that they will protect the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.\nThe President doesn't just believe this because these are freedoms that are American values. But the President believes these are democratic values and that Turkey has a long history of respecting these traditions. And even in the wake of such a serious upheaval that happened in the midst of their failed coup,\nthat these values need to be respected.\nQ: But the President then doesn't think that what the government has been doing is unacceptable?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, look, I think the Turkish government was nearly overthrown in a violent coup attempt that left hundreds dead and public buildings damaged. So it's understandable that they're going to take some time to recover from that.\nBut as they recover, the President has been clear -- and he's been clear in public statements and in his private conversation -- that the government of Turkey needs to uphold the highest standards of respect for their own nation's democratic institutions and the rule of law. That's going to be the best way for Turkey to get through this.\nQ: Okay. And did the President watch Hillary Clinton's speech last night? How much of last night did he actually view, do you know?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I know he had the television on last night and I know he saw Secretary Clinton's speech. I know he saw General Allen's speech. He remarked to a few of us at the White House how struck he was by General Allen's speech. He is obviously someone who knows General Allen quite well, but he had not seen him perform in that type of setting before.\nAs you know, the President released a quick statement last night. And he thought the speech was inspiring. I know there was a question yesterday whether or not Secretary Clinton was up to the task. That was never a question in the President's mind. The President, as he has said, believes that she's the most qualified individual to ever be running for President.\nSo I think the speech echoed a lot of the sentiments we've heard over the past week but also over the past years, and from both the President and from Democrats across the board. There is an abounding sense of optimism that was focused on the forward promise of America. We heard a lot of confidence in the American people. And we thought -- I thought the speech was quite forward-looking with a sense of pride and a love of country.\nWe heard a lot about building the economy from the middle class out. That is a deep-rooted philosophy for this President, but, again, Democrats across the board -- that the President believes that the strongest economy we can have in this country is one that builds the middle class out and supports economic growth for middle-class families.\nAnd then lastly, I think one of the strong themes we have heard this week is that America is a stronger country when we are united, and that our biggest strength is our diversity. This includes different races, different backgrounds, different faiths. I say this not because it's precisely the principle that has animated this President throughout his entire career in public office, but also because we believe it's a fundamental American value that's part and parcel to this nation's identity.\nQ: And now that we're learning more about the hacking that's been going on, and we're seeing another entity saying that they've been a victim of it, whoever did this, what it looks like, according to officials, is a state actor that is trying to influence the election. And that raises a question of the security of voting machines, electronic voting machines around the country. I mean, that's something that's talked about every year, but given the timing of this hack, how concerned is the White House about that? And the fact that we're dealing with so many small jurisdictions that are managing the maintenance and security of these machines, are you taking any measures to try to safeguard those? Is that even possible? And how?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Michelle, it's a good question, and I want to, before I answer, make clear that the FBI is still investigating the intrusion that you mentioned, so I'm not going to be in a position to get ahead of that investigation. So we're going to wait for them to make a determination on the perpetrator and a determination if they want to make that known publicly.\nBut your question about the integrity about the United States voting system is a good one. That's one that the President takes very seriously. I don't have any updates in terms of reviews or a detailed analysis of where that infrastructure stands, but as we've seen, Russia in the past has tried to influence elections in Europe and we take seriously their past record on this, and we also take seriously the integrity of our voting system.\nSo I'm not sure it's going to be fair to equate a cyber intrusion at a political committee with how elections are tabulated, but the President's commitment to cybersecurity is one that has not waned. The President has made clear that this has been a priority over the past seven or eight years. Even in the short time of this presidency, we've seen the technology develop in ways that might not have been anticipated back seven or eight years ago. That's why the President believes that our technology and our cyber defenses need to be kept up to speed. That's why there was a big -- significant proposal in his budget this year. Unfortunately, Congress hasn't acted on that. Congress instead decided to leave town for seven weeks. They haven't even had a hearing on that proposal. So, again, maybe when they get back from their vacation -- I mean their recess -- they can take a look at this.\nQ: Do you think this is something that the federal government will get involved in -- and I don't know what can be done really, but taking a look at this ahead of time? Except the DNC and DCCC, the security and resources that they have couldn't prevent a hack. How is some small county with far less resources going to even notice that there could be some tampering? Is this something that you see the White House or the federal government getting involved in?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think we should just separate out those two things, because the DCCC and the DSCC are political organizations. They don't conduct any voting. Voting isn't tabulated through those agencies.\nQ: Yes, but I'm saying a big entity, including the White House, and others that have been hacked -- they couldn't prevent it from happening. So we're talking about a bunch of voting machines in some county office somewhere. How are they supposed to have the resources to even know that a hack went on if it does?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, the President takes this enormously seriously. At the Department of Homeland Security, we have teams set up to act as resources for any agency outside the federal government that needs help, that needs support. So sometimes that's the private sector. Sometimes that's large companies. Sometimes that is political organizations like the ones we're talking about. And sometimes that's other governments. Sometimes that is smaller governments.\nSo that's a process and a resource that's housed at the Department of Homeland Security, so we do want to make sure they're getting the resources they need.\nQ: Thanks, Eric.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you.\nAngela.\nQ: Following up on Ayesha's question about Turkey, you mentioned that there had been allusions of U.S. involvement in the coup in one way or another, but just today President Erdogan specifically said that he thinks that the U.S. general in charge of the Central Command was involved, was supportive of the coup. Can you directly address President Erdogan's assertion on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. It is entirely false. There's no evidence of that at all. And the President made clear when he spoke on Friday that there was no U.S. involvement and no U.S. awareness ahead of time. And speculation to the contrary is baseless. Speculation along those lines, as the President said on Friday, is risky because it puts our men and women who are serving in Turkey at risk. So we feel that talk and speculation along those lines is not particularly constructive. It happens to not also be true.\nBut what the President is focused on is making sure that Turkey comes out of this time, begins to resume their normal practices, understanding how an event like this can shake a society and a government, but that the best way to do that right now is to resume their longstanding tradition and embrace of democratic institutions.\nQ: You read out a call a few days ago between the President and President Erdogan. Have they had the opportunity to talk any further, and/or are there are any plans for President Obama to make a call now that this has been percolating now for more days?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any additional calls to read out. As you point out, the President spoke -- made that call I believe two weeks ago now in the wake of the failed coup. I would also mention that the United States was one of the earliest countries to condemn the failed coup. In that statement, we supported President Erdogan. We expressed support for the democratic institutions, the democratically elected government of Turkey. So those were sentiments that were expressed both publicly through public statements, but also privately through the President's conversation with President Erdogan.\nQ: And then, finally, do you have any update on Turkey's request to extradite Mr. Gьlen from the U.S.?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have an update, Angela, other than to say that that is being assessed through the proper channels. I know that the Turkish government has sent over materials for our officials to review. As Josh has laid out, and the President did on Friday, I believe, in that press conference, there is a very specific channel for this to be worked through. And that process is ongoing. So we're not going to be in a position to provide a play-by-play up here with every crank. But if there's an update that's releasable, we'll let you know.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. I want to get the latest on Gitmo. Is it a reasonable expectation that another wave of detainees may be released in the next couple weeks? And if that drives the number below, say, 60, for example, or even into the 60s, what does that say about the President's efforts to continue to empty the facility there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Kevin, I think it's important to look back. You're always rightfully asking for the current numbers. But if you take a look back at the beginning of this administration, there were 242 detainees at Guantanamo, the facility there. Today there are 76. So we are going to continue to work diligently to reduce the population. We do this through safe and responsible detainee transfers. But I don't have any ones to preview for you at this time. As you know, when individuals are transferred, we will publicly release that information.\nQ: On Syria, I'm sure you are aware of reports today that Damascus and Moscow are now allegedly coordinating and cooperating an offensive to -- or I should say an operation in and around Aleppo. What is the administration's perspective of this alleged partnership?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Kevin, the United States is deeply concerned about the situation in Aleppo. Over the last few weeks, Russia and an Assad regime offensive have effectively cut off the opposition-held parts of the city. This only exacerbates the humanitarian situation by laying siege to some 300,000 civilians. The U.N. Special Envoy has noted that there may only be weeks of humanitarian supplies within the city.\nSo we're taking a look at Russia's announcement of the humanitarian corridors. But given their record on this, we're skeptical to say the least. Access to the city should be open to fully allow for unimpeded humanitarian support and commercial traffic to Syrian civilians in their homes. Unfortunately, Russia's involvement here is consistent with what we've seen from them over the past few months, which is, instead of focusing on the threat posed by ISIL, they are, instead, choosing to prop up the Assad regime. We believe that's not only counter to the national security of the United States, but it's also counter to the stated goals of a political transition inside Syria -- because as you know, that's not only our stated goal, but Russia stated that as a goal. So by continuing to prop up the Assad regime we're only delaying the inevitable.\nQ: So what does it say then about the overture from Secretary Kerry and the success or lack thereof?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think that that is a conversation that is happening with the goal of trying to strengthen the Cessation of Hostilities. I know that Secretary Kerry and his counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, have been having a series of conversations. Those steps, if agreed and implemented, will not be based on trust. We'll be looking for specific actions by Russia that show the Assad regime that Russia is going to fulfill their commitments.\nUnfortunately, I think as you're getting at, recent actions throw a lot of doubt into Russia's true intentions. So Russia is at a point where they're going to have to make a decision whether they want to continue to prop up the Assad regime, someone who we believe has lost the legitimacy to lead -- not the least of which is because he committed heinous acts against his own people. So Russia can continue to go down that path, or Russia can keep to its word, which as they have said, the only way to solve Syria right now is a political transition.\nQ: Are you aware -- I presume you are -- of airstrikes that may have claimed the lives of dozens of civilians in Syria? I understand by way of our sources at the Pentagon that CENTCOM is looking into the possibility. What can you tell us about that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, you're right, I believe CENTCOM has issued out a statement on this that says they're immediately going to look into this, and then once they retrieve their information they'll see if additional action is necessary. I can speak for the President when I say that this administration, the United States government takes all measures during the targeting process to avoid or minimalizing civilian casualties, or any collateral damage, and to comply with the principles of law of armed conflict.\nAs the President has noted, we cannot explain our efforts clearly and publicly when we're not completely transparent. So we believe that transparency is not only consistent with our democratic ideals and principles, but it's important for the sustainability of our counterterrorism efforts over the long term.\nQ: Lastly, on ISIS. Is it your perspective that even though the ongoing fight against ISIS in places like Syria and Iraq continue to ramp up from the American perspective -- and I've seen some numbers now where it's been suggested by some in the administration that you're actually shrinking their footprint by as much as 50 percent in some areas, for example, in Iraq. And yet it seems to me fairly clearly that it's beginning to pop up in other places and continue to spread. What's your perspective on that? And what, if anything, can you tell the American people who see this continued effort to fight and combat ISIS and yet they seem to be everywhere?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's a good question, Kevin. We are tightening the noose around ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and we're working with our partners to close off the border to reduce the flow of foreign fighters in Europe. One of the President's top goals in building the counter-ISIL strategy, building a coalition, which now exists of 67 members, was to shrink and ultimately eliminate the idea of a caliphate, a safe haven for these terrorists. That was a top priority. And like you said, we've made good progress on that so far.\nI believe you're right -- they have lost about 50 percent of the territory in Iraq that they once held. They've lost a little bit less in Syria, about 25 percent of what they held in Syria. But overall, that's the result of the coalition flying over 100,000 -- I'm sorry -- conducting over 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. We've also trained over 25,000 Iraqi security personnel.\nAnd the President believes this is a tribute to the strength and determination and resolve of our armed forces, but it's also due to the dramatic work of our State Department that we've been able to build a coalition of 67 members, most newly would be Interpol to help facilitate communication about this threat. And more pointedly to your question, we do have a comprehensive strategy that includes dealing with the challenge posed by foreign fighters as well as individuals radicalized by violence. That's principally why we are so proud and pleased that Interpol has joined the coalition.\nBut so this flow of foreign fighters has been a concern. It's something we've talked about, something that remains on the top of the President's mind when it comes to this. And we'll get to this in the week ahead, but the President is going to be convening his national security team on an update on our counter-ISIL efforts, and I'm sure this will be discussed.\nDavid.\nQ: Given what we saw in Philadelphia, is the President willing to give up on TPP, considering the rhetoric on the floor of the convention as well as some of the statements from the Clinton camp that she wants wholesale changes before she would support any of this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The answer to that question is no. The President believes that the Trade* [Trans]-Pacific Partnership is a good policy for American businesses and American workers. He is completely understanding of the complexities around the politics of the issue, that previous trade deals have not lived up to the hype. That's precisely why he directed his negotiating team to insist on the strongest, most robust human rights, labor, and environmental standards ever to be seen in a trade deal.\nSo the President is acutely aware of the politics around this. But that's not going to stop him from getting this done.\nQ: You've been saying that the White House insisted on that point, and a lot of the agency heads from USTR to others have pointed out -- talking about the merits. Do you believe that it's getting harder, though, and more difficult in the climate even among your own party? Because I don't see a lot of progress in winning over skeptics within the Democratic Party.\nMR. SCHULTZ: David, I'm old enough to remember people in this room reading the last rites to Trade Promotion Authority, about a year ago. And that skepticism was well-founded, but turns out, because of the arguments made on the merits, Democrats and Republicans came together to get that done. So we do believe this argument is right on the merits. And at the end of the day, that's what's going to prevail. Because 95 percent of the world's marketplace is outside of U.S. borders, so it only makes sense to make sure that American businesses and services can be marketed and sold around the world.\nQ: Secretary Clinton did not come out against TPA at that time, I don't believe. So now she's firmly -- seems to be expressing -- and her team -- expressing more skepticism of this deal and more adamant that she's not going to -- what's the administration's strategy from this point forward in getting it passed then? And if the Secretary, as her team has said and she I believe has said publicly she would not support a lame duck vote on this -- if she's on that position, will you still go forward with a push in the lame duck?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, you'll have to talk to Secretary Clinton about her views. Our focus has been on generating votes in the United States Congress, both in the House and in the Senate. The playbook for that will be Trade Promotion Authority. That as an instance where Democrats and Republicans came together, again, against some odds that some thought were long. But at the end of the day, the argument did prevail. And I'll tell you why -- because either we can write the rules of the road for trade, or China can.\nWe know that China is already negotiating their own trade deal, and we also know that that deal is not going to have the labor, environmental, and human rights standards that we've insisted on. So you're right that this will be something that Congress has to contend with, and they can either cede that ground to China -- the President believes that's the wrong approach, that we have the opportunity, we're in the catbird's seat to write the rules of the road for trade right now. And we should absolutely do that.\nQ: Will the White House be pushing for a lame duck vote?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President absolutely believes this deal should pass this year.\nQ: And final thing. The President spoke I think -- well, he seemed to maybe spend some time backstage with Secretary Clinton the other night in Philadelphia. I don't know if that may be the moment for it. But I'm wondering, has the President been talking to her and her team, specifically try to get her to support this deal? He's once had great support from her on TPP. Does he think that he can sway her, as he called her sort of the standard bearer, the torch bearer now of the party going forward?\nMR. SCHULTZ: David, I don't have details of that conversation. They did have a few minutes to catch up after the President's speech in Philadelphia on Wednesday evening. I think there were a few private moments for them to connect. I think also Secretary Clinton's family was there, too. So I doubt they had deep policy dives on any particular issue. But, again, our focus is on generating the sufficient votes in the House and the Senate.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Netanyahu's office put out a statement saying that they were dispatching their national security council chief to come here for the role of signing a new military aid agreement with the U.S. as soon as possible. Can you update us on the status of those talks? Is he going to be meeting with people at the White House, and do you guys anticipate that that will be finished next week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any meetings to announce at this time. I can tell you, though, that our national security staff does remain in close touch with their Israeli counterparts regarding a new 10-year memorandum of understanding on security assistance with Israel.\nAs we have long said, the Obama administration is prepared to sign a new MOU with Israel, which would include both foreign military financing funds and an unprecedented multiyear commitment of missile defense funding. This would constitute the largest single pledge of military assistance to any country in U.S. history. Like Israel, we remain committed to upholding the funding levels agreed by the United States and Israel in the current MOU, including $3.1 billion in funds in fiscal year 2017.\nQ: But you can't tell us whether you think it's going to be finished in the near term?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't have any meetings to announce at this time. If we have anything next week to read out, we'll let you know.\nMark.\nQ: Eric, when you say the developments on Zika in Florida ought to serve as a wakeup call, are you calling on Congress to come back early from its vacation -- oops, I mean, recess?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mark, I'm calling on Congress to get to work as soon as they find it convenient for them.\nQ: Convenient?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yeah. They had adequate time. I believe we sent up this proposal in February. They left town in the end of June. That was four months. They couldn't find the time to roll up their sleeves and get to work. And we should review the facts here. This was an administration proposal that the President sent up, but it was informed by our nation's top public health experts. So this shouldn't be a partisan issue. This shouldn't be a Democratic issue. I don't know mosquitos have partisan affiliation. Democrats and Republicans should get to work on a public health emergency. Democrats have been united in this, have been committed to doing this. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, got together and did a $1.1 billion proposal. The House fell far short of that. And unfortunately nothing got to the President's desk.\nQ: But if this is a public health issue, why wouldn't the President come right out and say, \"Congress, come back -- it's urgent. You ought to deal with this now and take your vacation later\"?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mark, the President was calling this urgent back in February, and Congress still decided to do nothing about it. So it's unfortunate that Congress left town without addressing this, but we should also remember that the President reprogrammed a lot of money, a lot of federal funding to address this in the wake of Republican recalcitrance.\nSo we've done what we can. I've outlined a number of things that are being stymied because Republicans continue to block this. But if they come back and get to work and get this done, then we can even provide more resources to states like Florida and elsewhere.\nQ: Dr. Fauci said this morning that NIH is getting very close to running out of the reprogram money. Isn't that a further wakeup call?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Absolutely. We did what we could earlier this year to reprogram federal funds, take them away from projects like Ebola, which still pose a threat to the public health of the international community. But there's only a finite spreadsheet available of funds that allow us to do so. So the keys here are sitting with Congress, and they ought to turn them and unleash more federal funding.\nQ: Okay, thanks.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you. Jan, welcome.\nQ: Thank you. Okay, so you have consistently made the case that the Senate should kind of do its job and confirm the President's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. So without making that case again, I just want to look forward. I mean, if they maintain the resolve, which sees no really signs right now that they're weakening there, would the President hope or expect Secretary Clinton would re-nominate him if she's elected President in November?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Jan, it's not going to surprise you to hear that we hope it doesn't come to that. The Senate ought to do its job. That's not something that the President believes. That's something that's enshrined in our Constitution. That's something that's consistent with past precedent. It's also something that Republicans have called for. George W. Bush's attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, has called for this. Other prominent Republicans have said what -- have called Leader McConnell's strategy misguided. So we absolutely believe that Republicans have a responsibility to fulfill their jobs and get this job.\nThis is on their to-do list when they get back from their recess. So we believe that there shouldn't be anything that stands in the way. And you don't have to take our word for it. Independent assessments of Chief Judge Garland have determined that he is one of the most qualified nominees ever to be nominated for the Supreme Court. The American Bar Association reviewed his record and found that lawyers and judges uniformly praised the nominee with integrity. They interviewed hundreds of individuals in the legal profession who knew Judge Garland, whether for a few years and decades. Not one person could utter a negative word about him. If that type of search was done about me, I'm not sure they'd come up with the same result.\nSo I believe that this is a unique situation, and the President nominated someone who is unquestionably qualified for the job. And the Senate should get to work and do their job.\nQ: But they showed no signs that they were going to move on that nomination. So has the President had any talks with Secretary Clinton about this? Or would you expect him to make the case for his nominee that she would re-nominate him if she were elected?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President is going to continue to make the case. Obviously, there's time when the Senate gets back in the fall. The President expects that the Senate should confirm Merrick Garland in this congressional term.\nQ: Right. I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much would you expect him to go to bat for his nominee if the Senate doesn't, and it does then fall to -- if Merrick Garland is going to be in the Supreme Court, it would be up to Secretary Clinton, if she's elected.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, the President has gone to bat for his nominee, and will continue to go to bat for his nominee. And the President believes that the Senate is abdicating its responsibility by ignoring those calls. And we should also point out, according to public statements, Secretary Clinton agrees with the sentiment that Chief Judge Garland should be confirmed for the Supreme Court. So this is someone who comes to this nomination with bipartisan support. He obviously generated a number of Republican votes back when he was nominated for the D.C. Circuit.\nSeveral of those Republicans are in office today. You'll have to ask them why they believe he earned their vote then, but not today.\nQ: And then if I could just -- there was a big voting rights decision out of the Fourth Circuit that's just come down. I haven't had a chance to look at it. But kind of coming on the heels of the decision on voter ID in Texas, does the President have any comment, or what would his statement be in general on some of this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I haven't been able to see what you're talking about, the specific case you're talking about. But I can tell you generally speaking that the President takes access to voting as a fundamental right. He believes that we should be doing everything possible to make it easier for people to vote -- not harder. That's a position he's held consistently. That's something that our Department of Justice has advocated in the federal courts. But it's also a matter of policy for the President in ways that he has assessed that the United States and this administration and states all across the country should be doing to make it easier for people to exercise their democratic rights.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. Back on Zika, Dr. Fauci says NIH is about out of money. But by our account of the original reprogrammed $589 million, there's still over $300 million of that available. So can you square his comments with that pot of money that's still sitting there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, I would refer you to the Department of Health and Human Services for exactly where the money is in the transactions. Obviously the President has directed his team to do everything possible to make sure that we're deploying all appropriate resources to combat this. Unfortunately, that's been made harder because Congress has sat on their hands for the last four months and decided to not do anything about this.\nWe spent some time talking about Florida. I know that the junior senator from Florida, despite being of a different political party than the President, spoke out on behalf of the President's proposal. Unfortunately, we can't say the same for the House members from the Republican Party in Florida. Maybe today's announcement will be a wakeup call to them. Maybe the governor's leadership on this would extend to House members having the courage to come back to Washington -- when they get back to Washington to fund this effort.\nQ: Why not dip into that money sooner and faster now, especially given the four cases in Florida?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm confident that the money has been dipped into, that all available resources have been or are being deployed in this effort. So the President has made clear to his team to spare no expense and to make sure that we're doing everything possible.\nStephanie.\nQ: On the convention. President Obama tweeted a glowing review of Secretary Clinton's speech last night, but what are the President's overall thoughts about the convention this week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, the President was there for a short time on Wednesday evening. He enjoyed his time there. Obviously it was brief. There's a lot of -- there's a big footprint when the President travels, so we didn't want to disrupt the sort of security infrastructure in Philadelphia too much. And I'll also say that the President -- I believe he remarked on Friday on the heels of the Cleveland convention how proud he was of local law enforcement working with Department of Homeland Security officials to keep the people of Cleveland safe. The same can be said for the Philadelphia convention.\nAll too often, when there's violence, law enforcement generate -- headlines are generated when there's violence. But the President believes that we ought to give as much or more attention to law enforcement when there's no violence and when things go right. And this was an instance where local law enforcement worked with Department of Homeland Security, worked with Secret Service to not only keep the convention-goers safe and the principals safe, but also the people of Cleveland safe.\nSo the President salutes our law enforcement on the ground. And then beyond that, there's a lot of pundits on the ground in Philadelphia who can give you their assessment of how the convention went. Some of them are former colleagues. Many of them might be on the Acela right now. But I'm not going to be able to offer a political assessment from here.\nQ: That works. Speaking of law enforcement, has the President been briefed on the two police officers in San Diego that were shot overnight?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any conversations with the President to read out. As you know, violence against police officers is something the President has spoken out strongly against not only in recent weeks, but for his entire time in public life. The President believes there is no excuse for committing violence against the men and women who wear the uniform, that these are law enforcement officials who put their lives on the line every day. They risk their lives to protect people like you and me. And the President believes that they deserve our respect. The President gave a speech about this in Dallas two weeks ago now.\nHe also spoke -- he's spoken out repeatedly about how much respect he has for local law enforcement. So obviously our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who we lost. And we'll be continuing to monitor the situation.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you. Goyal, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. Two questions. One, two conventions or summits are going on at the State Department on counterterrorism and also fighting against ISIL. One is more than 20 countries are representing religious and ethnic minorities under ISIL. And second one, India-U.S. counterintelligence summit. So where do we stand as far as -- and what role is the White House playing in this conference -- one between U.S. and India on counterterrorism, and second, ISIL? The most important thing is that where is ISIL getting money? It takes money to kill innocent people -- and their arms?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Goyal, I think you're talking about one of the latest efforts in our anti-coalition -- in our anti-ISIL coalition. This coalition is now made up of 67 partners around the world. The President is enormously proud of the coalition we've built to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. That work continues at a fast clip and at a robust level. So we have diplomatic efforts at our State Department that are ongoing. And that's only one component of our work.\nObviously, we're grateful for Prime Minister Modi's contributions on this. Like you said, it's not just about diplomacy or about military action, but it is about their financing. And that's why the President directed his Department of Treasury to do whatever we can to cut off and chokehold financing that streams towards ISIL.\nOur point person on this is an individual by the name of Adam Szubin. Mr. Szubin has worked for administrations of both parties. He worked in the George W. Bush administration, and he's one of the very best at what he does. Unfortunately, his nomination is stuck in Congress. His nomination is one of many things Republicans have failed to move on.\nAnd this one is one they have not offered any explanation for. I know that his nomination has been pending for many months in Congress. We find that unfortunate. Mr. Szubin himself has said that when he travels around the world in order to leverage our relationships to make sure that we are doing everything possible to cut off financing towards ISIL, that it's important that countries know that he has the President's back and that he fully represents the United States government. And that's why we call on the Senate to confirm him quickly.\nQ: And second, as far as South China Sea is concerned, very serious situation in the region after Philippines won a case against China in The Hague. China doesn't agree with the U.S. and it doesn't agree with the regional countries and those claiming a serious matter there. And the President of Singapore will be here on Monday meeting the President at the White House. This situation will be discussed with him because many experts at the think tanks are saying that that region of South China Sea may be beginning of third world war because China doesn't care about those nations who are democratic and peace-loving nations.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Goyal, I appreciate the pivot to the week ahead, which I'll get to in a minute. But you're right that this is an issue that the United States has been focused on for some time. I can tell you that Ambassador Rice was just in China having several meetings at all levels of their federal government where this issue was raised. So our work on this remains unabated. And I do expect this to be a topic to come up with President [Prime Minister] Loong* [Prime Minister Lee] here next week.\nObviously, we have deep economic ties with the country of Singapore. They're a member of the TPP. And the President had a very warm visit there back in 2009 right after he was elected. So the President did want to host Prime Minister Loong* [Lee] and Mrs. Loong* [Lee] here next week for a state visit.\nQ: What is the U.S. doing as far as China's threat to these small nations in the region as far as the South China Sea? That's the most important -- what message you think the President or U.S. has for these nations?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Our policy on this has been clear, Goyal. We don't take a position on any particular territory in the South China Sea. But what we do take a position on is these need to be adjudicated through international norms. So we believe that any sort of territorial dispute should be adjudicated through the appropriate international channels. That's what Ambassador Rice conveyed when she was in China earlier this week. And that's what we've said consistently publicly back here at home.\nQ: And finally, the U.S. is in contact with India to put this -- resolving this issue, as far as -- because India is also one of the parties in the region maybe threatened by China for their activities?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can tell you we're in close contact with the government of India. President Obama considers Prime Minister Modi a good friend. We've collaborated on a number of projects. Most recently and most notably, the agreement that the United States worked with India on allowed for the Paris climate deal to happen. And so the President is enormously proud of that work. He's also enormously grateful to Prime Minister Modi for his work on that. But that's not the only facet of our relationship. Obviously, we have deep economic ties, deep security ties. So the President deeply values his relationship with Prime Minister Modi.\nGreat. I will do the week ahead.\nOn Monday, the President will travel to Atlanta to deliver remarks at the 95th National Convention of the Disabled American Veterans group.

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118802", "text": "The Vice President. Hi, folks. Joe Biden here and I'm sitting with Tim Lewis, a retired federal judge who was nominated to the bench by a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic Senate—within four weeks of a presidential election.\nJudge Lewis. Hello, everyone. That's right. And I'm living proof that President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court—Chief Judge Merrick Garland—deserves similar consideration by today's Senate.\nThe Vice President. Not only because Merrick Garland is recognized—without exception—by the right and the left as one of America's sharpest legal minds and a model of integrity.\nJudge Lewis. But also because that's what the Constitution requires. The sitting President shall—not may—but shall nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, with the advice and consent of the Senate. That includes consulting and voting.\nThe Vice President. Here's how it works. For 17 years, I was chairman or ranking member of Senate Judiciary Committee, which overseas nominations to the Court. I presided over nine total nominations—more than anyone alive. Some I supported. Others I didn't. But every nominee was greeted by committee members. Every nominee got a committee hearing. Every nominee got out of the committee to the Senate floor, even when a nominee did not receive majority support in my committee. And every nominee, including Justice Kennedy—in an election year—got an up or down vote by the Senate. Not much of the time. Not most of the time. Every single time. That's the Constitution's clear rule of Advice and Consent. And that's the rule being violated today by Senate Republicans.\nNobody is suggesting that Senators have to vote \"yes\" on a nominee. Voting \"no\" is always an option. But saying nothing, seeing nothing, reading nothing, hearing nothing, and deciding in advance simply to turn your backs—is not an option the Constitution leaves open.\nJudge Lewis. And it has real consequences for all of us. In the four months since Merrick Garland's nomination, we've already seen how the Senate's refusal to act is preventing the Court from fulfilling its duty of interpreting what the law is and resolving conflicts in lower courts. Historic obstruction is leading to greater litigation costs and delays—the burden falling mostly on average Americans rather than corporations with endless resources. Unresolved decisions by the Supreme Court are leading to federal laws that should apply to the whole country being constitutional in some parts but unconstitutional in others. If this continues, our freedom of speech, our freedom to practice our faith, our right to vote, our right to privacy—all could depend on where we happen to live.\nThe Vice President. And the longer the vacancy remains unfilled, the more serious the problem—with greater confusion and uncertainty about our safety and security. If you have eight Justices on a case, Justice Scalia himself wrote, that it raises the, \"possibility that, by reason of a tie vote, the Court will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.\" And if Republican Senators fail to act, it could be an entire year before a fully staffed Supreme Court can resolve any significant issue before it.\nFolks, there's enough dysfunction in Washington, D.C. Now is not the time for it to spread to the Supreme Court.\nJudge Lewis. And we're better than what we're seeing. As a country, we're only as strong as the traditions we value—that we sustain by dedicating ourselves to something bigger than ourselves.\nThe Vice President. Folks, the defining difference of our great democracy has always been that we can reason our way through to what ails us and then act as citizens, voters, and public servants to fix it. But we have to act in good faith. For unless we find common ground, we cannot govern. For the sake of the country we love—we all have to do our job. The President has done his. Senate Republicans must do theirs.\nThanks for listening and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-07-30", "title": "The Weekly Address Delivered by the Vice President and Retired Federal Judge Timothy Lewis"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122623", "text": "President Obama Highlights the Unbreakable Commitment to Our Nation's Veterans and Work Done over the Past Seven and Half Years to Fulfill that Commitment\nOver the past seven and a half years, the President has maintained a steadfast commitment to serve our nation's veterans. In his speech to the 95th Disabled American Veterans (DAV) National Convention, the President will make clear that this commitment is a national responsibility and a promise that cannot be broken, and that the U.S. government and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have a vital role to play. This is not a responsibility that can be shirked by offering empty words belied by policies that would leave veterans to fend for themselves.\nThe President will review the hard, persistent work that the Administration has done to keep this promise. From delivering more health care than ever before, to providing veterans the benefits they have earned in a timely way, to expanding cutting edge research in areas like Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), to helping veterans get the education and jobs they need to succeed, the Administration has an indisputable record of support for our veterans.\nIn his speech, the President will also announce two major new milestones in this effort:\n•      Since launching a nationwide strategy to prevent and end homelessness in 2010, the Administration has worked with state and local partners to cut veteran homelessness nearly in half.\n•      As part of the President's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), 500,000 veterans have voluntarily donated their health data to the future of science and medicine through the VA's Million Veteran Program (MVP), marking a critical halfway point to the goal of signing up one million veterans.\nMoving forward, the President and the entire Administration will keep fighting in five core areas of service to our nation's veterans.\nI. Health Care – Making sure veterans have timely and high-quality access to care\nAn essential part of this commitment is ensuring veterans receive the health care they need, when they need it. VA continues to make progress in this effort, increasing access to care and ensuring veterans are satisfied with their care. Over the past year, VA has served a historic number of veterans, completing nearly 58 million appointments, almost 5 million more than the year before. Even as more veterans are coming to VA for more care, nearly 97% of those appointments are completed within 30 days of the veteran's preferred date or the date that is clinically appropriate. And 90% of veterans surveyed are either \"satisfied\" or \"completely satisfied\" with the timeliness of their care.\nBut there is still more work to be done, and VA continues to execute on a number of strategies to increase access to care:\n•      Expanding care in the community – VA continues to increase options for care for veterans, authorizing 3.2 million instances of care in the community from June 2015 through May 2016, 7% more than the prior year. In addition, VA put forward a comprehensive plan last October to rationalize its various care in the community programs, creating a single program that is easy to understand, simple to administer, and meets the needs of veterans, community providers, and VA staff.\n•      Increasing clinic hours – Over the last 2 years, VA has increased total clinical work by 10%, which translates into roughly 20 million more hours of care for veterans.\n•      Getting veterans off wait lists – VA has hosted two National Access Stand Down events at all VA Medical Centers, with the goal of addressing urgent health care needs and getting veterans off of waiting lists.\n•      Making enrollment easier – In June 2016, VA released a new digital health care application, making it easier for veterans to enroll in VA health care.\n•      Leading in telehealth – VA conducted over 2 million telehealth visits in Fiscal Year 2015, reaching more than 677,000 veterans. And it is developing 4 regional Telemental Health Hubs to improve access to telemental health care for veterans.\n•      Improving care for women veterans – Women are the fastest growing subgroup of veterans, and to ensure the proper resources and support, the VA has now trained over 2,400 providers in women's health to ensure that every women veteran has the opportunity to receive her primary care from a Designated Women's Health Provider. 100% of VA Medical Clinics and 94% of Community Based Outpatient Clinics now have at least one Designated Women's Health Provider.\n•      Expanding space and facilities – VA activated over 2.2 million square feet in VA facilities last fiscal year for clinical, mental health, and long-term care.\nThe Administration has also prioritized steps to improve mental health care for veterans. Building on an Executive Order issued in 2012, a series of additional actions announced by the President in 2014, and the signing of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, we have made significant progress in this effort. Since the President took office, funding for veterans' mental health care has increased by 76%. The number of veterans accessing mental health care from VA has increased by 80% over the past decade to over 1.6 million veterans. But our work is not done. The VA recently announced a new commitment to provide same-day services for all veterans with urgent mental health care needs by the end of this year.\nAt the same time that we are caring for veterans today, we continue to invest in research to develop the next generation of medical care. Central to this is the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a cornerstone of the President's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) which is helping make tailored treatments a reality for all Americans. MVP is a longitudinal research program powered by the continued service of our nation's veterans. By enrolling in MVP, participants donate their health information to help researchers and health professionals better understand health and disease and pave the way for future discoveries that will benefit us all. Tomorrow, the President will announce that 500,000 veterans have now enrolled in MVP, bringing us halfway to our goal of a million veterans.\nII. Benefits – Tackling the backlog of claims and modernizing the appeals process\nWe have taken dramatic steps to make sure that veterans get an answer on their disability compensation claims in a timely and efficient manner and get the benefits they deserve and have earned. Three and a half years ago, nearly 610,000 disability claims were stuck in a backlog waiting for longer than 125 days, and the VA did not have the capacity to keep up with an increasing number of claims. Veterans were left languishing for far too long. But by transforming internal processes and putting in place a new electronic system to move beyond the archaic paper-based system that was in place, VA has made extraordinary progress. Today, that backlog of disability claims is less than 80,000, a nearly 90% reduction from its peak in 2013. Last year, VA set a new record high by processing 1.4 million benefits claims for veterans, and has already processed over 1 million claims this fiscal year – the 7th year in a row that milestone has been met. And veterans with a pending claim are waiting less than a third as long as they used to for a decision – 90 days today, down from 282 days in March 2013.\nAt the same time, as the VA continues to process more initial disability compensation claims, a greater number of veterans are getting stuck in a broken appeals process. When veterans appeal their claim decision, they should be able to get an answer back – with a clear and direct path forward to resolution – within a year. Unfortunately, the broken process that exists today – created by decades of overlapping laws, court cases, and regulations – doesn't allow for that. Currently, more than 450,000 appeals are pending at some point in the current process, and veterans are waiting an average of 3 years for a decision (and an average of 5 years for those appeals that go all the way through the process and reach the Board of Veterans Appeals). This state of affairs is unacceptable and is failing veterans.\nThe VA has taken what steps it can to improve the current process, including introducing a new tool to improve internal processing. But what is needed is broad reform, and the problem is only going to get worse until Congress acts. That is why the President is reiterating his call for comprehensive legislative modernization of the appeals process. The Administration has worked closely with Veteran Service Organizations to submit a proposal to Congress that accomplishes this goal. Congress should act on this legislation without delay – our veterans cannot afford to wait any longer.\nIII. Homelessness – Working to prevent and end veteran homelessness\nEnding veteran homelessness is a national imperative. And beginning in 2010 with the release of Opening Doors, the nation's first-ever strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, the Administration has dedicated itself to this goal. The First Lady and Dr. Biden launched the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness, and over 880 city and county officials have now pledged to end veteran homelessness. From New Orleans to Houston, Philadelphia to San Antonio, and Virginia to Connecticut, cities and states across the country have already announced that they have done just that. In total, 27 communities and 2 states have announced they have ended veteran homelessness to-date.\nTomorrow, the President will announce a major national milestone in this ongoing effort. Based on results of the 2016 Point-in-Time Count of homelessness across the country conducted in January, veteran homelessness declined by 17% last year to under 40,000 individuals. This means that we have cut overall veteran homeless nearly in half – by 47% - since 2010. And the progress is even more pronounced for those veterans that had been living on the street and without a place to stay, as unsheltered veteran homelessness declined by 20% last year and has declined by 56% since 2010.\nThe Administration is also announcing that, later this fall, the First Lady will be holding an event with local officials, non-profits, Federal partners, private sector partners, advocates, and veterans to celebrate this extraordinary progress, announce additional milestones in the fight to end veteran homelessness, and underscore the Federal, state and local partnerships that have been essential to our success, as a blueprint for this critical work to continue in coming years.\nIV. Economic Opportunity – Fighting to give veterans every chance to enjoy the American Dream\nWhen veterans return home from their service to our country, we must ensure they have the opportunities and resources they need to succeed. Our veterans gain immense skills during their time in service that employers can leverage to help build our economy. The Administration continues to work to make sure veterans are provided opportunities to fulfill the American dream.\nWe continue to see significant progress in employment for veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans has been cut by more than half, falling from a high of 9.9% in January 2011 to 4.2% in June 2016, lower than the national average. Progress is similarly encouraging for Post-9/11 veterans, where the unemployment rate is 4.4% today, decreasing from a high of 15.2% in January 2011. To build on this progress, businesses across the country are coming together and answering the call of the President and the entire Administration to hire veterans. Since the launch of the First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative, more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses have been hired or trained. In May, the First Lady announced more than 170,000 new veteran and military spouse hiring and training commitments from over 50 companies in the telecommunications, aerospace, and technology sectors over the next 5 years. This is a joint effort to provide veterans and military spouses with meaningful employment and opportunities to gain new skills for our workforce. And the Federal government continues to play a leading role in the drive to hire veterans, increasing the percentage of veterans hired by the Executive Branch from 24 percent when the President took office to 32 percent last year, and hiring a total of roughly 475,000 veterans during that time.\nThe President has also made it a priority to ensure veterans and their families have access to the high-quality education they need to succeed. And that starts with the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Since its inception in 2009, the Post-9/11 GI Bill has provided $65.2 billion in education benefits to over 1.6 million individuals. Today, in response to legislation the President signed into law, all 50 states, Washington D.C., and the 5 U.S. Territories are providing recently transitioning veterans and their dependents with in-state tuition rates at public institutions of higher learning. And we have taken important steps to expand veterans' awareness of their education options, expanding the GI Bill Comparison Tool and redesigning the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to expand technical training and equip veterans with the skills they need.\nV. Resources and Transformation at the VA – Making sure VA is serving every veteran\nThis Administration has made historic investments in serving our veterans, increasing access to health care, expanding benefits, and investing in VA research and facilities. The President's 2017 Budget continues this record of robust support, providing $75 billion in discretionary funding for the VA, an increase of $3.6 billion over the 2016 enacted level. These resources will support priorities such as additional processing capacity for disability claims appeals and strong support for veteran homelessness programs. The Budget also includes a 2018 advance appropriations request for discretionary Medical Care of $66.4 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the 2017 request, to ensure that VA has the funding certainty it needs to provide health care for veterans. The level of overall funding requested in the President's 2017 Budget represents an over 85% increase in funding for the VA compared to when the President took office.\nBut serving every veteran is not just about resources; it's also about establishing an organization that has the veteran's needs at the center of everything that it does. Under the leadership of Secretary McDonald, VA is in the process of becoming just that type of organization through the MyVA initiative. MyVA is the name of VA's transformation effort that puts veterans in control of how, when, and where they wish to be served. The MyVA vision is to provide a seamless, unified Veteran Experience across the entire organization and throughout the country. VA is working to reorganize the Department with this vision in mind, guided by ideas and initiatives from veterans, employees, Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) and others. And as part of MyVA, the Department is taking a number of discrete steps, including establishing a new Advisory Committee of skilled experts from the private, non-profit and government sectors, creating new Community Veteran Engagement Boards across the country, building an Innovators Network to share ideas to improve the organization, and launching a new website – vets.gov – to serve as a one-stop shop for veterans to access services from the VA.", "timestamp": "2016-07-31", "title": "Fact Sheet: A Record of Serving Our Veterans"}
